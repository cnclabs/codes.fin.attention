calando has developed a nanoparticle based drug delivery system for sirna 
calando s platform technology is currently being tested in an open label phase i dose escalating clinical trial to systemically deliver for what is believed to be for the first time a sirna drug candidate targeting cancer 
the trial is progressing toward determining the primary endpoints of tolerability and maximum tolerated dose  while demonstrating preliminary proof of concept rnai activity in some patients 
calando is based on pioneering technology invented in the chemical engineering department of the california institute of technology 
developed to reduce the debilitating effects of cancer treatment  calando s proprietary molecules are designed to improve the safety and efficacy of cancer therapeutics 
currently focused on sirna and oncology applications  calando s platform technology has the potential to be applied to a wide range of diseases beyond cancer as well as to therapeutic classes beyond sirna therapeutics 
calando is focused on the clinical development of rondel tm  its sirna delivery technology  and calaa  the associated drug candidate 
interim clinical results show that calaa is well tolerated and has demonstrated preliminary proof of rnai activity in patients treated with the highest doses 
these results represent several notable firsts in the field of rnai  including first to demonstrate definitive rnai delivery after systemic administration and first to show dose dependent accumulation in target cells 
in addition  calaa has been shown to mediate specific gene inhibition in humans as evidenced by mrna knockdown and protein knockdown in tumor biopsies 
in addition  in december  calando concluded a phase i trial with it using a drug candidate consisting of its delivery system and a small molecule anti cancer agent 
patients from this clinical trial reported fewer and less serious side effects with several cases of stable disease over many months of treatment 
one patient with pancreatic cancer had stabilized disease for months 
the further development of the small molecule delivery platform and it  the associated drug candidate  was licensed to cerulean pharma  inc  cerulean a private biotech company in boston  massachusetts in june 
table of contents platform technology based on a novel polymeric sugar linear cyclodextrin molecule  calando s drug delivery system has been applied thus far to the delivery of two classes of therapeutics sirna and other oligonucleotides and small molecule drugs 
the polymer is combined with the drug molecule to form a drug containing nanoparticles sized larger than nanometers and smaller than nanometers 
the company believes that this particle size is important  drug molecules are typically sized below nanometers and are quickly cleared from the body in the urine 
nanoparticles sized larger than nanometers circulate longer and thus can allow administration of lower doses to patients 
nanoparticles sized smaller than nanometers can escape the circulatory system through the abnormally leaky blood vessels that feed tumors and are retained in the tumor tissue due to a lack of effective tumor lymphatic drainage 
preferential accumulation in tumor tissue  where the drug can take effect  leaves other tissues relatively unaffected 
the drug delivery system has the added benefits of increasing solubility  allowing targeting of the nanoparticles  and being non immunogenic 
calando s rondel tm technology rna interference or rnai is a naturally occurring mechanism for the regulation of gene expression that selectively inhibits the activity of  or silences  target genes 
discovered by scientists in who were subsequently awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  rnai has been hailed as having potential to be a tremendous breakthrough in treating diseases 
because many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of genes  rnai has potential application to many serious or fatal diseases including cancer  aids  hepatitis c  huntington s disease and others 
the mechanism is mediated by small interfering rna known as sirna 
one of the key challenges to using rnai therapy has been the inability to systemically deliver sirna in humans 
naked sirna is degraded and destroyed by nucleases in the bloodstream and is not taken up by cells 
calando s rondel tm system is providing new hope that effective sirna delivery can be achieved safely and economically 
calando s polymers form the foundation for its three part rnai oligonucleotide nanoparticle delivery rondel technology 
the first component is the positively charged polymer that  when mixed with sirna  binds to the negatively charged backbone of the sirna 
the polymer and sirna self assemble into nanoparticles less than nm diameter that fully protect the sirna from nuclease degradation in serum 
the cyclodextrin in the polymer enables the surface of the particles to be decorated by stabilizing agents and targeting ligands 
these surface modifications are formed by proprietary methods involving the cyclodextrins 
logo the surface modifying agents have terminal adamantane groups that form inclusion complexes with the cyclodextrin and contain poly ethylene glycol peg to endow the particles with properties that prevent aggregation  enhance stability and enable systemic administration 
targeting molecules can be covalently attached to the adamantane peg modifier  enabling the sirna containing particles to be targeted to tissues of interest 

table of contents rondel technology offers the following advantages generalized delivery system binds to and self assembles with the sirna to form uniform colloidal sized particles 
analysis has shown that these particles are spherical and between nm and nm in diameter 
ease of administration the rondel system has been designed for use as part of a two vial system one vial contains the delivery components  and the second vial contains the therapeutic sirna payload 
when mixed pursuant to a simple protocol  the particles self assemble into sirna containing nanoparticles 
any sirna sequence can be easily substituted because rondel binds to the sirna backbone  theoretically  any sirna therapeutic could be in the second vial 
stealthy delivery to the immune system the sugar based delivery vehicle allows for repeat dosing with reduced risk of immune reactions 
unlike lipid delivery vehicles  the cyclodextrin based rondel delivery system has a low immune stimulatory potential 
safety the rondel technology has been shown to be non toxic in in vitro testing with human cell cultures  and the fully formulated polymer sirna particles exhibit a significant therapeutic window of safety in animals  even when repeated doses up to eight doses over a four week period are used 
rondel has been well tolerated by patients in calando s clinical trials 
stable under physiological conditions particles have been shown to be stable under physiological conditions 
effective targeted delivery calando and its partners have demonstrated successful delivery of functional sirna therapeutics to tumor cells and to hepatocytes by systemic administration and confirmed sequence specific gene inhibition in humans 
calaa calaa is a combination of rondel and a patented sirna targeting the m subunit of ribonucleotide reductase  a clinically validated cancer target 
ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleosides to deoxyribonucleosides and is necessary for dna synthesis and replication  and thus tumor growth 
the sirna  developed at calando  demonstrates potent anti proliferative activity across multiple types of cancer cells 
we believe the use of calaa in calando s phase i trial  initiated in june  was the first sirna therapeutic candidate to target cancer in a human clinical study and also the first systemic delivery of an sirna therapeutic candidate 
the trial is utilizing a dose escalation protocol which appears to be nearing the highest dose in the protocol and yielding promising preliminary results 
through september   patients were enrolled in the phase i clinical trial out of a planned protocol of up to patients 
interim clinical results were recently presented at the american society of clinical oncology meeting asco 
data from a total of patients accrued to dose levels     mg m showed that calaa was well tolerated 
treatment related adverse events were mostly mild to moderate with fatigue  fever chills  allergic  or gastrointestinal related adverse events most frequently observed 
importantly  no changes in coagulation  liver function tests  or kidney function were observed 
analysis of tumor biopsies from three melanoma patients showed the presence of intracellular nanoparticles in amounts that correlated with dose 
additionally  a reduction was found in both the rrm messenger rna and protein levels when compared to pre dosing tissue 
furthermore  the presence of sirna mediated mrna cleavage products was confirmed by race  demonstrating that sirna mediated mrna cleavage occurs specifically at the site predicted for an rnai mechanism 
these preliminary results were published in march in the scientific journal nature  citing these interim data from our phase i trial as the first evidence of systemic delivery of sirna  and the successful silencing of a widely recognized cancer gene via rna interference in humans 
patient accrual is ongoing at the university of california  los angeles  california and the start clinic  san antonio  texas and additional safety and pharmacodynamic data will be forthcoming 
calando plans to further develop calaa in the clinic as capital resources may allow 
this may include a phase ib phase ii clinical trial in combination with traditional chemotherapeutics in cancer indications with high unmet medical need 
combination therapy is especially promising for calaa  because overexpression of its cellular target  rrm  has been associated with resistance to certain types of chemotherapeutics 
in pre clinical studies  calaa has shown significant synergistic activity in these cases 

table of contents calando s cyclosert tm technology it the other polymeric drug delivery technology  cyclosert  was designed by calando s scientists for the delivery of small molecule drugs 
cyclosert provides many of the same benefits as the rondel system 
in december  calando completed a phase i trial with it  comprised of calando s polymer and camptothecin  a potent anti cancer drug  with a positive safety profile and indications of efficacy 
on june   calando entered into agreements to license cyclosert and it to cerulean 
under the terms of the agreements  calando granted cerulean an exclusive royalty bearing worldwide license to certain patent rights and know how and transferred to cerulean certain intellectual property related to the linear cyclodextrin drug delivery platform and it in exchange for an initial payment of million 
under the agreements  calando retained the rights to use the linear cyclodextrin drug delivery platform to deliver any kind of nucleic acid including sirna 
as such  calando retains the rights to its rondel platform  as well as the calaa and calaa lead drugs 
outsourced clinical trial management  r d  manufacturing and supply calando used contract manufacturers to manufacture each of its product candidates and has on hand sufficient material to complete the calaa phase i study 
these materials were manufactured in accordance with a quality control and quality assurance program  including a set of standard operating procedures and specifications  designed to ensure that its products are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing procedures  or cgmps  and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations 
currently  calando has no laboratory facilities and is reliant on contract r d facilities to support its clinical trial 
along with its internal resources  calando uses consultants to manage and monitor its clinical trial 
calando plans to continue to rely on third parties to meet these needs 
the development of calaa  it and other pipeline candidates are preliminary  and there is no assurance that they will be successful 
there are numerous technical  regulatory and marketing challenges that must be overcome to successfully commercialize calando s products  including  but not limited to the following advancing pipeline candidates requires extensive preclinical testing and approval by the us food and drug administration fda before clinical testing can commence 
advancing therapeutic candidates through preclinical and clinical testing is expensive  resource intensive and time consuming 
complications may arise that would cause the clinical testing to be interrupted or stopped 
fda approval is required before products can be sold 
even if fda approval is eventually obtained  there is no assurance that it will be accepted by the medical community 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of the development projects  the completion dates or when or if revenue will be generated 
for additional information relating to the risks of developing new therapies  please see item a risk factors 
intellectual property calando controls an intellectual property portfolio of patents covering certain linear cyclodextrin polymers and related technology the linear cyclodextrin system 
the portfolio covers both rondel and cyclosert 
in june  calando sold and assigned to cerulean certain calando owned patents for linear cyclodextrin polymers conjugated to drugs 
additionally  calando granted cerulean an exclusive license under its rights to the linear cyclodextrin system to develop certain drug products 
calando retained rights to use the linear cyclodextrin system to develop drugs in which the therapeutic agent is a nucleic acid eg  sirna  a second generation epothilone  tubulysin or cytolysin 
calando also owns an issued patent covering the sirna active ingredient in calaa and has filed a patent application to cover the sirna active ingredient of calaa calando has licensed patents from alnylam relevant to sirna therapeutics for calaa and calaa calando has in licensed from r d biopharmaceuticals exclusive rights to second generation synthetic epothilones 
calando has out licensed to r d biopharmaceuticals the use of the linear cyclodextrin system for delivering tubulysin and cytolysin drugs 
the rnai and nanoparticle drug delivery patent landscape is complex and rapidly evolving 
as such  calando may need to obtain additional patent licenses prior to commercialization of its lead drug candidates 
the drug delivery and oncology markets despite advances in drug discovery  pharmaceutical firms remain challenged by getting the right compound to the right place in the human body  where it can maximize its effect 
additionally  over the next decade  multiple blockbuster pharmaceuticals will go off patent  resulting in a significant loss to the pharmaceutical industry as generic versions of these drugs enter the market 
patent expiration coupled with a challenging drug discovery environment  and continued problems with late stage trial failures has left pharmaceutical pipelines thin 
in response  the industry has pursued reformulation of existing or previously failed compounds using new drug delivery technology to expand pipelines and prolong patent life 
according to the american cancer society  cancer is the 
table of contents second leading cause of death in the united states and accounts for approximately one in every four deaths 
the national institutes of health has estimated the direct medical cost of cancer to be in excess of billion per year 
dose limiting toxicity  poor tissue specificity  and large effective distribution are major restrictive factors in effective cancer chemotherapy 
consequently  complete tumor response is not often achieved in patients receiving chemotherapy alone 
we believe that this offers a potentially significant opportunity for firms developing technologies to more effectively deliver anti cancer agents to malignant cells 
competition calando is engaged in the rapidly changing business of developing treatments for human disease through the regulation of gene expression and delivery of proprietary novel cancer therapies 
competition in these fields is intense as other companies are developing therapies similar to our nanoparticle drug delivery systems  and targeting patient populations that are similar to the patient populations that are targeted by calando 
a number of companies are pursuing research and development programs relating to the emerging area of cancer therapies using nanoparticle conjugates and rna interference 
a number of these companies have filed patent applications in these areas 
it is difficult to predict whether any of these companies will be successful in obtaining patent protection  whether the patent protection sought will address important aspects of the technology and to what extent these companies will be successful in their rna interference efforts 
new competitors may arise and we may not be aware of all competitors in this space 
a number of calando s competitors are more established and have greater resources than calando 
furthermore  even if calando is successful in developing commercial products  it is possible that competitors will achieve greater market acceptance 
systemic delivery of sirna and other oligonucleotide therapeutics has proven critical for the success of all nucleic acid therapeutics 
naturally  multiple firms have recognized the problem of systemic sirna delivery as a significant opportunity and other firms are developing products in this space 
companies developing sirna delivery products include but are not limited to alnylam  merck  novartis  tekmira  rxi pharmaceuticals  benitec  quark pharmaceuticals  marina biotech  isis pharmaceuticals and silence therapeutics 
additionally  many academic groups are developing and may seek to commercialize sirna delivery technologies

unidym  inc overview unidym is a leader in carbon nanotube based transparent  conductive films tcfs for the electronics industry 
tcfs are a critical component in devices such as touch panels  displays  and thin film solar cells 
for example  both touch panels and lcds typically employ two tcf layers per device 
unidym s tcfs offer substantial advantages over the incumbent technology  indium based metal oxides  including improved durability  lower processing costs  and lower overall cost structure 
unidym s products are based on electronics grade carbon nanotubes cnts  a class of molecules with multiple unique properties 
for instance  some varieties conduct electricity better than copper  are stronger than steel  and may be synthesized in bulk quantities 
in  the cnt field was highly fragmented  and arrowhead sought to consolidate the intellectual property for the technology in an effort to create a dominant position in high value cnts 
as a result of licensing from universities and acquisitions of three cnt related companies  unidym owns or has exclusive license to a large portfolio of over key cnt related patents and patent applications 
the company believes unidym holds foundational intellectual property surrounding high value electronics grade cnt manufacturing and processing 
with this strong patent portfolio and significant experience applying this technology to electronics markets  unidym is beginning to make modest sales of its tcf film to device manufacturers and believes that it is well positioned to increase sales in unidym s management team is focused on customer interaction to optimize its products to meet customer specifications with a goal of generating product sales for touch screens in the near term 
collaborations and partnerships unidym has several ongoing programs with various partners to incorporate its transparent conductive films into touch panels and displays 
in  a leading japanese touch panel maker demonstrated three dimensional touch panels  based on unidym s films  at the premier displays conference in north america  the society of informational display 
unidym also announced new joint development agreements with tokyo electron to develop and commercialize manufacturing equipment for printable cnt based displays and solar cells as well as guardian industries to develop and commercialize cnt coated glass products 
unidym also continued to collaborate with samsung electronics in cnt based displays and nippon kayaku in cnt based solar cells 

table of contents in addition to these efforts in unidym s core focus of electronics  unidym is seeking to leverage its broad intellectual property portfolio in other areas through its licensing and other collaborative programs 
to date  unidym has out licensed its intellectual property to a number of different companies  including samsung  ensysce biosciences  nexeon medsystems  dupont  nano c  nano lab  torrey pines  continental carbon  and several other companies 
production production of carbon nanotube based transparent conductive films unidym s film production model involves in house pilot production and outsourced supply of larger volumes of a proprietary grade of cnts  formulation of those cnts into a coating ink  and then shipment of that ink to an outsourced coating partner or customer for deposition 
to conserve cash and pursue a strategy designed to yield revenues in the short term  unidym is exploring partnerships or outsourcing within this supply chain 
unidym has in house deposition or coating equipment which is used for the deposition of cnts onto plastic or glass substrates in sample quantities 
unidym has also tested production samples from several coating subcontractors 
the use of outsourced coating partners for its touch panel films would take advantage of the substantial excess capacity left in the coating industry by the decrease in demand for photographic film 
unidym expects that  given the abundance of these subcontractors and the availability of cost effective subcontract capacity  there will be no need to bring production capacity in house in the near term 
production of carbon nanotubes unidym has historically produced carbon nanotubes in house 
in line with its strategy to reduce costs and work with manufacturing partners  in may  unidym transferred a portion of its assets for cnt production to ccni  a manufacturer of cnts and carbon black  has been working with ccni and other vendors for the production of unidym s cnt supply needs 
unidym anticipates retaining some limited in house cnt production capability for product improvements and as a second source of supply 
unidym plans to manufacture cnt inks and is negotiating with potential partners to manufacture and sell films to customers 
marketing and sales unidym generated revenue from sales of thin films  sales of cnts and sales of cnt based ink in fiscal future revenue is expected to be generated through direct product sales and license deals into relatively consolidated industries 
in addition  unidym has taken advantage of its extensive metrology equipment and excess space to create a small incubator for start ups to defray a portion of the costs for its sunnyvale facility 
in the near term  unidym does not expect to generate enough revenue to self fund its operations 
unidym expects to continue to generate revenues through direct sales of its hipco grade cnts 
competition unidym faces competition from a number of start ups and established companies in its target markets 
in the electronics industry  there are a number of start up or private companies that are focused on the application or production of nanotubes including automate  c nano  eikos  nantero and southwest nanotechnologies 
more established companies with announced cnt programs include brewer sciences  dupont  honeywell  samsung  sumitomo and toray 
there are also potential competitors who are pursuing alternative nanotech based approaches to the markets served by unidym  including the start up cambrios and large japanese companies such as fujitsu 
intellectual property unidym controls an intellectual property portfolio containing over foreign and domestic patents and patent applications 
the portfolio contains patent claims directed to fundamental carbon nanotube compositions of matter  as well as carbon nanotube synthesis  purification  dispersion and functionalization 
furthermore  the portfolio contains claims to the use of carbon nanotubes in many different application areas including fibers  electronics  composite materials  energy storage generation  medical devices and drug delivery 
some patents and patent applications are owned by unidym or co owned with partners such as continental carbon and tokyo electron  but most are exclusively licensed from institutions such as rice university  georgia tech  clemson  suny  and california institute of technology caltech 
under its agreement with clemson  unidym has an exclusive license to us patents  and  which we believe have the earliest priority date of any patent claiming transparent  conductive films comprised of carbon nanotubes 
under its agreement with caltech  unidym has the right to sublicense us patent  which is the basic patent claiming small diameter nanotube composition of matter 
unidym also has the right to license an ip portfolio related to modified fullerene for non therapeutic fields of use 
a material portion of unidym s intellectual property portfolio is exclusively licensed from rice university 
if the sum of unidym s debts  liabilities and other obligations is greater than all of unidym s assets at fair valuation or if unidym is generally not paying its debts  liabilities and other obligations as they come due  the rice license will terminate and unidym may lose rights to critical intellectual property

leonardo biosystems  inc overview leonardo is a drug delivery company that employs a novel multi stage drug delivery mechanism aimed at dramatically increasing targeting efficiency of pharmaceuticals 
arrowhead has an approximately ownership interest in leonardo 
leonardo s silicon microparticulate technology involves transporting a therapeutic agent past multiple biological barriers using multiple carriers  each optimized for a specific barrier 
leonardo s proprietary primary vehicles are designed to preferentially accumulate at tumor vasculature 
secondary carriers are then released from the primary carriers that are designed to accumulate around tumor cells and release their therapeutic payloads 
animal testing suggests that leonardo s platform enables significantly increased targeting and also provides sustained release 
during  leonardo received an initial tranche of million of an overall million award from the state of texas emerging technology fund 
leonardo is currently focused on scaling up a commercializable manufacturing process and broadening the demonstrated areas where the technology delivers value

academic partnerships since inception  arrowhead has worked with some of the most outstanding academic institutions in the country  including the caltech  stanford university  duke university and the university of florida  in critical areas such as stem cell research  carbon electronics and molecular diagnostics 
this has provided the company with a deep network in the academic community  insight into cutting edge technologies and a world class scientific advisory board 
through these partnerships  arrowhead has gained access to exclusive rights that have formed the basis for the company s subsidiaries and minority investments and has leveraged university resources to further develop and test technology in a highly cost effective way 
the collaborations with academic scientists have included technology licenses and options to license technology  sponsored research  donations to the labs of individual scientists and use of university facilities that are made available to development stage companies 
in prior years  arrowhead devoted significant capital resources to sponsored research 
as the subsidiaries have matured  the company has decreased its reliance on sponsored research for technology development and sponsored research expense has decreased 
as of september   arrowhead had one active sponsored research agreement at duke university through unidym 
depending on capital resources  arrowhead is likely to continue to invest in nanoscience research and development through sponsored research agreements at universities 

table of contents item a 
risk factors we are a development stage company and we have limited historical operations 
we urge you to consider our likelihood of success and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by entities at similar stages of development 
the following is a summary of certain risks we face 
they are not the only risks we face 
additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
risks related to our financial condition we have limited cash resources 
our plan of operations is to provide substantial amounts of development funding and financial support to our subsidiaries over an extended period of time 
the company adopted a cash conservation strategy that reduced corporate expenses and scaled back our financial support for our two major subsidiaries  unidym and calando 
this has influenced unidym s decision to engage partners for its capital intensive bulk cnt manufacturing and concentrate its resources on the development of cnt inks and cnt based film products  and calando s decision to curtail internal r d efforts for its drug delivery platforms and clinical candidates and seek partners for future development of its drug candidates 
management continues operate under a plan to conserve cash resources while selectively investing in near term opportunities 
the company s management anticipates that the company will be able to satisfy the cash requirements of its operations through at least the next twelve months with current cash resources 
however  we may need to obtain additional capital to further our development efforts  and we intend to seek additional capital by out licensing technology  selling one or more of our subsidiaries  securing funded partnerships  conducting one or more private placements of equity securities of the company or our subsidiaries  selling additional securities in a registered public offering  or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these endeavors or  if we are successful  that such transactions will be accomplished on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we will implement additional cash saving measures  which could materially harm our business and our ability to achieve cash flow in the future  including delaying or reducing implementation of certain aspects of our plan of operations 
even if we are successful in obtaining additional capital  because we and each subsidiary are separate entities  it could be difficult or impossible to allocate funds in a way that meets the needs of all entities 
the current financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business 
neither the company nor our subsidiaries generate substantial revenue  and our operations and research and development activities have been primarily funded through the sale of company securities and securities of our subsidiaries 
current market conditions may impair our ability to raise the capital we need 
if we are unable to secure additional cash resources from the sale of securities or other sources  it could become necessary to further slow  interrupt or close down development efforts 
in addition  we may have to make additional reductions in expenses at the company  which could impair our ability to manage our business and our subsidiaries 
even if investment capital is available to us  the terms may be onerous 
if investment capital is needed and available to unidym and or calando and the company does not have the funds to make a pro rata investment  our ownership interest could be diluted 
the sale of additional company stock to fund operations could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
the strategy for eventual monetization of our subsidiaries will likely depend on our ability to exit our ownership position in each subsidiary in an orderly manner 
exit opportunities could include an initial public offering ipo for the subsidiary or acquisition of the subsidiary by another company 
during the recent economic recession  companies have been adopting conservative acquisition strategies and  even if there is interest  they may not be able to acquire our subsidiaries on terms that are attractive to us 
these factors could reduce the realizable return on our investment if we are able to sell a subsidiary 
additionally  the market for ipos continues to be very limited  which limits public exit opportunities for our subsidiaries 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq capital market  which has certain compliance requirements for continued listing of common stock 
in the past  we have been subject to delisting procedures due to a drop in the price of our common stock 
if our minimum closing bid price per share falls below for a period of consecutive trading days in the future  we may again be subject to delisting procedures 
we must also meet additional continued listing requirements contained in nasdaq marketplace rule b  which requires that we have a minimum of  in stockholders equity   market value of listed securities held by non affiliates or  of net income from continuing operations for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years 
as of december   based on our closing price as of that day  the market value of our securities held by non affiliates was approximately 
table of contents as of the close of business on december   our common stock had a closing bid price of per share  and has had a bid price of less than for consecutive days 
accordingly  on december   we received a deficiency letter from the nasdaq stock market indicating that  based on the company s closing bid price for the last consecutive business days  the company does not comply with the minimum bid price of per as set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule a 
in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule c a  the company has a grace period of calendar days  or until june  to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing 
in order to regain compliance  the minimum closing price per share of the company s common stock must be at least for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
in the event the company does not regain compliance by june   the company may be afforded an additional day compliance period  provided it demonstrates that it meets all other applicable standards for initial listing on the nasdaq capital market except the bid price requirement 
if the company fails to regain compliance after the second grace period  the company s stock will be subject to delisting by nasdaq 
delisting could reduce the ability of our shareholders to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as easily as they have done historically 
for instance  failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange may make it more difficult for traders to sell our securities 
broker dealers may be less willing or able to sell or make a market in our common stock 
not maintaining our nasdaq capital market listing may among other effects result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock  lessen interest by institutions and individuals in investing in our common stock  make it more difficult to obtain analyst coverage  and make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
we have debt on our consolidated balance sheet  which could have consequences if we were unable to repay the principal or interest due calando has a  unsecured convertible promissory note outstanding 
the note bears interest accrued annually  matured in november and is payable upon demand 
the note is payable at two times face value in certain events  including  among other things  the license of calando s sirna delivery system 
an amendment to extend the note is currently being negotiated  however if the note is not extended  the company has the ability and intent to repay this note 
however  if calando is unable to meet its obligations to the bearer of the note  arrowhead may also not be in a position to lend calando sufficient cash to pay such demand note 
unless other sources of financing become available  this could result in calando s insolvency 
our subsidiaries have entered into technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective and  if these agreements are terminated  our technology and our business would be seriously and adversely affected 
through our subsidiaries  we have entered into exclusive  long term license agreements with rice university  california institute of technology  alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc and other entities to incorporate their proprietary technologies into our proposed products 
these license agreements require us to pay royalties and satisfy other conditions  including conditions related to the commercialization of the licensed technology 
we cannot give any assurance that we will successfully incorporate these technologies into marketable products or  if we do  whether sales will be sufficient to recover the amounts that we are obligated to pay to the licensors 
failure by us to satisfy our obligations under these agreements  including the solvency requirements set forth in our license agreement with rice university  may result in the modification of the terms of the licenses  such as by rendering them non exclusive  or may give our licensors the right to terminate their respective agreement with us  which would limit our ability to implement our current business plan and harm our business and financial condition 
risks related to our business model and company we are a development stage company and our success is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of new business ventures 
the implementation of our business strategy is still in the development stage 
we currently own majority interests in two subsidiary companies  investments in two early stage biotech companies and  through unidym  one university research project at duke university 
our business and operations should be considered to be in the development stage and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture 
accordingly  our intended business and operations may not prove to be successful in the near future  if at all 
any future success that we might enjoy will depend upon many factors  several of which may be beyond our control  or which cannot be predicted at this time  and which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  business prospects and operations  and the value of an investment in the company 

table of contents calando may be unable to find additional partners to license its technologies 
as part of our cash conservation strategy that scales back our financial support for calando at this time  calando has closed its laboratory facilities  eliminated its technical employees and has shifted its focus to licensing its technologies to partners 
currently  calando has one licensing partner  but there can be no assurance that calando will be able to find additional partners to license its technologies upon terms favorable to calando 
if calando licenses its technologies  it will lose a considerable amount of control over its intellectual property and may not receive adequate licensing revenues in exchange 
the business model of our subsidiaries has historically been to develop new nanotechnologies and to exploit the intellectual property created through the research and development process to develop commercially successful products 
calando has licensed a portion of its technology to cerulean pharma  inc and intends to pursue further licensing arrangements with other companies 
a significant portion of the potential value from these licenses is tied to the achievement of the development and sales milestones  which we cannot control 
as calando licenses its technology to other companies  it will lose control over certain of the technologies it licenses and will be unable to control the development and commercialization of its technologies  which could result in the failure to achieve performance milestones that would represent a significant portion of the total value of any license transaction 
in addition  calando s licensees may not be successful in the further commercialization of calando s technologies and anticipated revenues from such license agreements may be less than expected or may not be paid at all 
there are substantial risks inherent in attempting to commercialize new technological applications  and  as a result  we may not be able to successfully develop nanotechnology for commercial use 
the company finances research and development of nanotechnology  which is a new and unproven field 
our scientists and engineers are working on developing technology in various stages 
however  such technology s commercial feasibility and acceptance is unknown 
scientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes a long time to reach commercial viability  if at all 
to date  our research and development projects have not produced commercially viable applications  and may never do so 
during the research and development process  we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome 
for example  our scientists must determine how to design and develop nanotechnology applications for potential products designed by third parties for use in cost effective manufacturing processes 
because of these uncertainties  it is possible that none of our potential applications will be successfully developed 
if we are unable to successfully develop nanotechnology applications for commercial use  we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business 
because we have not generated significant revenues to cover our operating expenses  we are dependent on raising additional capital from investors or lenders 
to date  we have only generated a small amount of revenue as a result of our current plan of operations 
given our strategy of financing new and unproven technology research  there is no assurance we would ever generate significant revenues 
our revenue producing opportunities depend on liquidity events within our subsidiaries  such as a sale of the subsidiary  licensing transaction or initial public offering 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to create a liquidity event for any of our subsidiaries and  even if we are able to  we cannot be certain of the timing or the potential proceeds to arrowhead as a stockholder 
accordingly  our revenue prospects are uncertain and we must plan to finance our operations through the sales of equity securities or debt financing 
if we are unable to continue raising operating capital from these sources  we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations 
we will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our applications to generate revenues and achieve profitability 
even if our research and development yields technologically feasible applications  we may not successfully develop commercial products  and even if we do  we may not do so on a timely basis 
even if our research efforts are technologically successful  it could take several years before this technology will be commercially viable 
during this period  superior competitive technologies may be introduced or customer needs may change  which could diminish or extinguish the commercial uses for our applications 
because nanotechnology is an emerging field  the degree to which potential consumers will adopt nanotechnology enabled products is uncertain 
we cannot predict when significant commercial market acceptance for nanotechnology enabled products will develop  if at all  and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market 
if markets fail to accept nanotechnology enabled products  we may not be able to generate revenues from the commercial application of our technologies 
our revenue growth and achievement of profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce new technological applications to manufacturers for products accepted by customers 
if we are unable to cost effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among original equipment manufacturers and customers  or if the associated products do not achieve wide market acceptance  our business will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we will need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop and market our products 
we do not possess all of the resources necessary to develop and commercialize products that may result from our technologies on a mass scale 
unless we expand our product development capacity and enhance our internal marketing  we will need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize current and future products 
if we do not find appropriate partners  or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful  our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected 
even if we are able to find collaborative partners  the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates in those programs will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and is beyond our control 
in addition  in the event we pursue our commercialization strategy through collaboration  there are a variety of technical  business and legal risks  including a development partner would likely gain access to our proprietary information  potentially enabling the partner to develop products without us or design around our intellectual property  we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development or commercialization of our product candidates or to their marketing and distribution  and disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research  development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management s resources 
the occurrence of any of the above risks could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition 
we need to retain a controlling interest  by ownership  contract or otherwise  in unidym and calando in order to avoid potentially being deemed an investment company under the investment company act of companies that have more than us stockholders or are publicly traded in the us or are  or hold themselves out as being  engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities are subject to regulation under the investment company act of unless a substantial part of our assets consists of  and a substantial part of our income is derived from  interests in majority owned subsidiaries and companies that we primarily control  whether by contract or otherwise  we may be required to register and become subject to regulation under the investment company act 
because investment company act regulation is  for the most part  inconsistent with our strategy of actively managing and operating our portfolio companies  a requirement to operate our business as a registered investment company would restrict our operations and require additional resources for compliance 
if we are deemed to be  and are required to register as  an investment company  we will be forced to comply with substantive requirements under the investment company act  including limitations on our ability to borrow  limitations on our capital structure  restrictions on acquisitions of interests in associated companies  prohibitions on transactions with our affiliates  restrictions on specific investments  and compliance with reporting  record keeping  voting  proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations 
in order to avoid regulation under the investment company act  we may choose to make additional pro rata investments in unidym and calando to maintain a controlling interest 
nanotechnology enabled products are new and may be viewed as being harmful to human health or the environment 
there is public concern regarding the human health  environmental and ethical implications of nanotechnology that could impede market acceptance of products developed through these means 
nanotechnology enabled products could be composed of materials such as carbon  silicon  silicon carbide  germanium  gallium arsenide  gallium nitride  cadmium selenide or indium phosphide  which may prove to be unsafe or harmful to human health or to the environment because of the size  shape or composition of the nanostructures 
for this reason  these nanostructures may prove to present risks to human health or the environment that are different from and greater than the better understood risks that may be presented by the constituent materials in non nanoscale forms 
because of the potential  but at this point unknown  risks associated with certain nanomaterials  government authorities in the us or individual states  and foreign government authorities could  for social or other purposes  prohibit or regulate the use of some or all nanotechnologies 
the us environmental protection agency has in that regard recently taken steps towards regulation of the manufacture and use of certain nanotechnology enabled materials  including those containing carbon nanotubes or nanosilver 
further  the us national academy of sciences national research council concluded that the us government needs to develop a more robust and coordinated plan for addressing the potential environmental  health  and safety risks of nanomaterials 
the regulation and 
table of contents limitation of the kinds of materials used in or used to develop nanotechnology enabled products  or the regulation of the products themselves  could halt or delay the commercialization of nanotechnology enabled products or substantially increase the cost  which will impair our ability to achieve revenue from the license of nanotechnology applications 
we may not be able to effectively secure first tier research and development projects when competing against other ventures 
our business plan requires that we identify and successfully acquire promising technologies 
however  we compete with a substantial number of other companies that fund early stage  scientific research at universities to secure rights to promising technologies 
in addition  many venture capital firms and other institutional investors invest in companies seeking to commercialize various types of emerging technologies 
many of these companies have greater financial  scientific and commercial resources than us 
therefore  we may not be able to secure the opportunity to finance first tier research and commercialization projects 
furthermore  should any commercial undertaking by us prove to be successful  there can be no assurance competitors with greater financial resources will not offer competitive products and or technologies 
we rely on outside sources for various components and processes for our products 
we rely on third parties for various components and processes for our products 
while we try to have at least two sources for each component and process  we may not be able to achieve multiple sourcing because there may be no acceptable second source  other companies may choose not to work with us  or the component or process sought may be so new that a second source does not exist  or does not exist on acceptable terms 
in addition  due to the continued tightening of global credit markets  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
therefore  it is possible that our business plans will have to be slowed down or stopped completely at times due to our inability to obtain required raw materials  components and outsourced processes at an acceptable cost  if at all  or to get a timely response from vendors 
we must overcome the many obstacles associated with integrating and operating varying business ventures to succeed 
our model to integrate and oversee the strategic direction of various subsidiaries and research and development projects presents many risks  including the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel  and the diversion of our management s attention as a result of evaluating  negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures 
if we are unable to timely and efficiently design and integrate administrative and operational support for our subsidiaries  we may be unable to manage projects effectively  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our business objectives and the value of an investment in the company could decline 
in addition  consummating acquisitions and taking advantage of strategic relationships could adversely impact our cash position  and dilute stockholder interests  for many reasons  including changes to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred to fund our growth strategy  and any issuance of securities to fund our operations or growth  which dilutes or lessens the rights of current stockholders 
our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and scientists with relevant expertise 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees  including dr 
anzalone  our ceo 
in addition  we rely on several key executives to manage each of our subsidiaries 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our executives 
our ability to execute our strategy also will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientists  sales  marketing and additional managerial personnel 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we could have difficulty implementing our business plan in a timely manner  or at all 
we may need to terminate additional employees  including senior management and technical employees  or such employees may seek other employment which may result in the loss of valuable know how and that development efforts could be negatively affected 
members of our senior management team and board may have a conflict of interest in also serving as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries 
while we expect that our officers and directors who also serve as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries will comply with their fiduciary duties owed to our stockholders  they may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and the minority stockholders of our subsidiaries 
specifically  dr 
anzalone  our ceo and president  is the founder  ceo and a board member of each of nanotope  a regenerative medicine company in which the company owns a interest  and leonardo  a drug delivery company 
table of contents in which the company owns a interest 
dr 
anzalone owns a noncontrolling interest in the stock of each of nanotope and leonardo 
to the extent that any of our directors choose to recuse themselves from particular board actions to avoid a conflict of interest  the other members of our board of directors will have a greater influence on such decisions 
our efforts pertaining to the pharmaceutical industry are subject to additional risks 
our subsidiary  calando  as well as minority investments nanotope and leonardo  are focused on technology related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates 
drug development is time consuming  expensive and risky 
even product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in early animal and human clinical trials  often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as clinical trial results may be unacceptable  even though preclinical trial results were promising  inefficacy and or harmful side effects in humans or animals  the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the us food and drug administration  may not approve our potential product for the intended use  and manufacturing and distribution may be uneconomical 
clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians and others  which often delays  limits  or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products 
additionally  clinical trials can take years to complete site selection and the enrollment of patients 
if the subsidiaries technology is not cost effective or if the associated drug products do not achieve wide market acceptance  the value of a subsidiary would be materially and adversely affected 
any drugs developed by our subsidiaries may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations  third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives  thereby harming our business 
increasing expenditures for healthcare have been the subject of considerable public attention in the us both private and government entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs 
numerous proposals that would affect changes in the us healthcare system have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures  including reductions in the cost of prescription products and changes in the levels at which consumers and healthcare providers are reimbursed for purchases of pharmaceutical products 
the ability of calando and our minority investments  nanotope and leonardo  to market products successfully either on their own or in partnership with other companies will depend in part on the extent to which third party payers are willing to reimburse patients for the costs of their products and related treatments 
these third party payers include government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
in addition  the trend toward managed healthcare and government insurance programs could result in lower prices and reduced demand for the products of these companies 
cost containment measures instituted by healthcare providers and any general healthcare reform could affect their ability to sell products and may have a material adverse effect on them  thereby diminishing the value of the company s interest in these subsidiaries or any anticipated milestone or royalty payments 
we cannot predict the effect of future legislation or regulation concerning the healthcare industry and third party coverage and reimbursement on our business 
there may be a difference in the investment valuations that we used when making initial and subsequent investments in our subsidiaries and minority investments and actual market values 
our investments in our subsidiaries and noncontrolling interests were the result of negotiation with subsidiary management and equity holders  and the investment valuations may not have been independently verified 
traditional methods used by independent valuation analysts include a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
we have not generated a positive cash flow to date and do not expect to generate significant cash flow in the near future 
additionally  we believe that there exist few comparable public companies to provide meaningful valuation comparisons 
accordingly  we have not sought independent valuation analysis in connection with our investments and may have invested in our various holdings at higher or lower valuations than an independent source would have recommended 
there may be no correlation between the investment valuations that we used over the years for our investments and the actual market values 
if we should eventually sell all or a part of any of our consolidated business or that of a subsidiary  the ultimate sale price may be for a value substantially different than previously determined by us  which could materially and adversely impair the value of our common stock 

table of contents risks related to our intellectual property if unidym is unable to raise additional cash or pay its debts  unidym may lose rights to critical intellectual property 
unidym is required to meet certain financial covenants pursuant its rice university license agreement 
the rice license includes financial covenants tested quarterly for compliance 
if unidym fails to meet the financial covenants  the rice license may terminate 
if this should happen  the value of unidym s intellectual property portfolio would be significantly and adversely affected and unidym would likely lose patent protection for its products and licensing opportunities for the majority of its cnt intellectual portfolio 
our ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain  exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage 
our subsidiaries have licensed rights to pending patents and have filed and will continue to file patent applications 
the researchers sponsored by us may also file patent applications that we choose to license 
if a particular patent is not granted  the value of the invention described in the patent would be diminished 
further  even if these patents are granted  they may be difficult to enforce 
even if successful  efforts to enforce our patent rights could be expensive  distracting for management  cause our patents to be invalidated  and frustrate commercialization of products 
additionally  even if patents are issued and are enforceable  others may independently develop similar  superior or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us  or our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others 
thus  the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage 
if we are unable to derive value from our licensed or owned intellectual property  the value of your investment may decline 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to develop and commercialize products based on their respective patent portfolios  will depend  in part  on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to enforce those patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that any patents that may issue from patent applications owned or licensed by us or any of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient protection to conduct our respective businesses as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted  or that we or our subsidiaries will remain free from infringement claims by third parties 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products 
because the nanotechnology intellectual property landscape is rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary  it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third party rights 
however  we are currently aware of certain patent rights held by third parties that  if found to be valid and enforceable  could be alleged to render one or more of our business lines infringing 
if a claim should be brought and is successful  we may be required to pay substantial damages  be forced to abandon any affected business lines and or seek a license from the patent holder 
in addition  any patent infringement claims brought against us or our subsidiaries  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns 
these could negatively affect our results of operations and prospects 
there can also be no assurance that patents owned or licensed by us or our subsidiaries will not be challenged by others 
in addition  if our potential products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  these third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers  and we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages they suffer as a result of these claims 
the claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use 
if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to continue selling such products 
the technology licensed by our subsidiaries from various third parties may be subject to government rights and retained rights of the originating research institutions 
we license technology from caltech  rice university  and other universities and companies 
our licensors may have obligations to government agencies or universities 
under their agreements  a government agency or university may obtain certain rights over the technology that we have developed and licensed  including the right to require that a compulsory license be granted to one or more third parties selected by the government agency 
in addition  our collaborators often retain certain rights under their agreements with us  including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use  to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology  and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology 
it is difficult to monitor whether our collaborators limit their use of the technology to these uses  and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse 

table of contents risks related to regulation of our products our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations 
our operations  including our research and development and our commercialization efforts  such as clinical trials  manufacturing and distribution  are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program  we cannot be assured that the company or our employees are  or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations or laws 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations or laws  a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a commercialized product  significant fines  sanctions  or litigation  any of which could harm our business and financial condition 
if export controls affecting our products are expanded  our business will be adversely affected 
the federal government regulates the sale and shipment of numerous technologies by us companies to foreign countries 
our subsidiaries may develop products that might be useful for military and antiterrorism activities 
accordingly  federal government export regulations could restrict sales of these products in other countries 
if the federal government places burdensome export controls on our technology or products  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
if the federal government determines that we have not complied with the applicable export regulations  we may face penalties in the form of fines or other punishment 
risks related to our stock stockholder equity interest may be substantially diluted in any additional financing 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  on such terms and at such prices as our board of directors may determine 
as of september    shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 
as of september    shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options 
as of september   there were warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock 
the issuance of additional securities in financing transactions by us or through the exercise of options or warrants will dilute the equity interests of our existing stockholders  perhaps substantially  and might result in dilution in the tangible net book value of a share of our common stock  depending upon the price and other terms on which the additional shares are issued 
our common stock price has fluctuated significantly over the last several years and may continue to do so in the future  without regard to our results of operations and prospects 
because we are a development stage company  there are few objective metrics by which our progress may be measured 
consequently  we expect that the market price of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate significantly 
we do not expect to generate substantial revenue from the license or sale of our nanotechnology for several years  if at all 
in the absence of product revenue as a measure of our operating performance  we anticipate that investors and market analysts will assess our performance by considering factors such as announcements of developments related to our business  developments in our strategic relationships with scientists within the nanotechnology field  our ability to enter into or extend investigation phase  development phase  commercialization phase and other agreements with new and or existing partners  announcements regarding the status of any or all of our collaborations or products  market perception and or investor sentiment regarding nanotechnology as the next technological wave  announcements regarding developments in the nanotechnology field in general  the issuance of competitive patents or disallowance or loss of our patent rights  and quarterly variations in our operating results 
we will not have control over many of these factors but expect that they may influence our stock price 
as a result  our stock price may be volatile and any extreme fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could result in the loss of all or part of your investment 

table of contents the market for purchases and sales of our common stock may be very limited  and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market  our securities historically were relatively thinly traded 
investor trading pattern could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock 
for example  mandatory sales of our common stock by institutional holders could be triggered if an investment in our common stock no longer satisfies their investment standards and guidelines 
accordingly  it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock 
unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock  sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock  our stock price and trading volume may decline 
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business 
we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by industry or securities analysts 
investors have many investment opportunities and may limit their investments to companies that receive coverage from analysts 
if no industry or securities analysts commence coverage of the company  the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
in the event we obtain industry or security analyst coverage  if one or more of the analysts downgrade our stock or comment negatively on our prospects  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease to cover our industry or us or fails to publish reports about the company regularly  our common stock could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could also cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the sale of shares by our management or founding stockholders 
sales of our common stock by our officers  directors and founding stockholders could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of those securities 
additionally  the price of our common stock could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
we cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock  or the potential for those sales  will have on our share price 
furthermore  due to relatively low trading volume of our stock  should one or more large stockholders seek to sell a significant portion of its stock in a short period of time  the price of our stock may decline 
we may be the target of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common stock 
we will not distribute cash to our stockholders unless and until we can develop sufficient funds from operations to meet our ongoing needs and implement our business plan 
the time frame for that is inherently unpredictable  and you should not plan on it occurring in the near future  if at all 
our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  which may make an acquisition of the company by another company more difficult 
we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the company that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
specifically  our board of directors  without further action by our stockholders  currently has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights including voting rights  preferences and privileges of these shares blank check preferred 
such preferred stock may have rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock

table of contents overview arrowhead research corporation is a development stage nanotechnology holding company with an emphasis in nanomedicine 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses as we fund our investments in early stage technologies 
historically  arrowhead has relied upon issuances of capital stock to raise capital to fund operations  and we expect to continue to seek such investment going forward 
calando is currently conducting a phase i clinical trial for its lead drug candidate  calaa  an sirna therapeutic based on rondel  calando s proprietary sirna delivery system technology 
we expect continued development in rondel and calaa  as well as investing in future drug candidates 
arrowhead does not intend to independently fund clinical trials through submission of a new drug application for fda approval  and is working to employ its partnering strategies intended to decrease costs and maximize the company s ability to bring products to market 
arrowhead has been focused on entering strategic partnering agreements for continued development of calando and unidym 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial statements and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further information  see note  organization and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements which outlines our application of significant accounting policies and new accounting standards 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed and delivery has occurred  a price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we may generate revenue from product sales  technology licenses  collaborative research and development arrangements  and research grants 
revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and or guaranteed technology license fees  collaborative research funding  and various milestone and future product royalty or profit sharing payments 
revenue associated with up front license fees and research and development funding payments  under collaborative agreements  is recognized ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research and development period 
revenue from substantive milestones and future product royalties is recognized as earned based on the completion of the milestones and product sales  as defined in the respective agreements 
payments received in advance of recognition as revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that our assumptions about the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
if impairment is indicated  recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value using the black scholes options pricing model  which requires us to make assumptions regarding certain variables including the risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating stock based compensation expense represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties  and if factors change or the company used different assumptions  its stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
derivative liabilities we account for warrants and other derivative financial instruments as either equity or liabilities based upon the characteristics and provisions of each instrument 
warrants classified as equity are recorded as additional paid in capital on our consolidated 
table of contents balance sheet and no further adjustments to their valuation are made 
some of our warrants were determined to be ineligible for equity classification because of provisions that may result in an adjustment to their exercise price 
warrants classified as derivative liabilities and other derivative financial instruments that require separate accounting as liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value on the date of issuance and are revalued on each subsequent balance sheet date until such instruments are exercised or expire  with any changes in the fair value between reporting periods recorded as other income or expense 
we estimate the fair value of these liabilities using option pricing models that are based on the individual characteristics of the warrants or instruments on the valuation date  as well as assumptions for expected volatility  expected life and risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions used could have a material impact on the resulting fair value 
the primary input affecting the value of our derivatives liabilities is the company s stock price 
for example  a change in the value of the company s stock price would affect the value of the derivative liability by approximately million to million  depending on other inputs 
intellectual property intellectual property consists of patents and patent applications internally developed  licensed from universities or other third parties or obtained through acquisition 
patents and patent applications are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  and any impairment found is written off 
licensed or internally developed patents are amortized over the life of the patent 
purchased patents are amortized over three years 
results of operations the company had a net loss of million for the year ended september   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended september   a decrease of million 
the decrease in the fiscal net loss versus the fiscal net loss was the result of a number of factors

the number of employees at arrowhead and its subsidiaries decreased from an average of employees during fiscal to an average of employees during fiscal altogether  research and development costs decreased million  general and administrative costs decreased million  consulting costs decreased million  salary and salary related costs decreased million  and stock based compensation decreased million 
additionally  there was a non cash gain of million related to a derivative liability recorded in association with the june equity issuance see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these decreased expenses were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million 
unidym began a cost reduction program during fiscal and reduced its operating expenses to a level which continued into fiscal prior to  unidym was pursuing a business plan based on building a vertically integrated company that would manufacture both carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube films 
due to the changes in the economic environment in late  unidym changed its manufacturing strategy to focus on the use of outside manufacturing availability rather than expand its internal capabilities 
in line with this strategy  unidym closed its texas operations in january  and reduced its texas workforce 
unidym consolidated its northern california operations into one facility in and also decreased the number of management and technical staff 
this resulted in a reduction in personnel and other costs later in the year  and such cost reductions were maintained into development costs at unidym have been substantially reduced and the pace of development will depend on the cash resources and partnership opportunities available to unidym 
calando also reduced expenses in fiscal due to a change in business strategy 
rather than incur the significant expense of running multiple clinical trials  calando decided to seek partners for further development of its technology 
beginning in fiscal and continuing into fiscal  calando reduced its management and technical staff culminating with the closure of its lab facility in pasadena  california in june after a partnership for one of its drug delivery technologies and its associated clinical candidate was signed  significantly reducing its costs 
in fiscal  the phase i trial for calaa was initiated  and in fiscal  significant expense was incurred for manufacture of the components for calaa  preparation for an ind for calaa and the continuation of calando s clinical trials 
expenses in fiscal were primarily related to the phase i clinical trials related to calaa  but were somewhat limited as the accrual of patients was suspended for several months in as calando developed a new stability assay 
the enrollment of patients in the calaa clinical trial resumed in may and was in progress at the end of fiscal continued clinical and preclinical development of calando s drug candidates will depend on the cash resources available to calando 
revenues the company generated revenue of  and  for the years ended september  and  respectively

table of contents applicable to unidym technology   from the sale and delivery of carbon nanotubes to third parties and  of collaboration services revenue 
the primary reason for the reduction in revenue in fiscal is that the company did not enter into any significant partnership agreements in operating expenses the analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the company within the major expense categories 
for purposes of comparison  the amounts for the years ended september  and are shown in the table below

research and development r d compensation related expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to unidym s reduction in research scientists and process engineers and the closure of unidym s texas facility 
calando has also reduced laboratory personnel in connection with its decision in to license its small molecule platform and associated drug candidate and close its laboratory facility 
two calando employees have been retained to manage the calaa clinical study and to facilitate the partnership arrangements for calando s technology 
stock based compensation is a non cash charge related to grant date fair value of stock options  which is recognized over the vesting period 
during fiscal year  the number of options outstanding decreased as a result of options being cancelled following employee terminations

travel expenses can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on current projects and activities 
business insurance expense was  during the year ended september   compared to  in the comparable prior period 
the decrease in the cost of business insurance is primarily related to a refund received in june of  at calando related to an adjustment in clinical insurance costs from a previous year based on the number of enrolled patients

licensing fees  milestones and royalties consist primarily of amounts paid by unidym under the terms of its license agreement with rice university and calando for the license for sirna targets from alnylam  and licensing arrangements with caltech 
this expense decreased primarily due to reduced fees owed to caltech  and also due to the nonrepeat of other one time fees from fiscal in fiscal  purchased in process r d expense resulted from the exchange of arrowhead stock for unidym stock
