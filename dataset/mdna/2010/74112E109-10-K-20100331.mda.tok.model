item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are a life sciences company focused on the development and commercialization of a novel  enabling  platform technology called pressure cycling technology pct 
pct uses cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra high levels up to  psi and greater to control bio molecular interactions 
our pressure cycling technology uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra high levels at controlled temperatures to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio molecules 
our instrument  the barocycler  and our internally developed consumables product line  which includes pulse pressure used to lyse samples for extraction tubes as well as application specific kits  which include consumable products and reagents  together make up the pct sample preparation system pct sps 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations with respect to our pressure cycling technology business since we commenced our pressure cycling operations 
during  we undertook a number of cost reduction measures including a comprehensive restructuring program  to significantly reduce costs  centralize core operations  and refocus business strategy in specific areas where our products have found significant initial market acceptance 
the restructuring program included a reduction in personnel of eight full time employees of the workforce  reduction in travel and meeting attendance for all personnel  decreases in the base salary of most of our employees and all of our executive officers  a shutdown of our research and development facility in rockville  md  a consolidation of our research and development activities in massachusetts  and delay of several research and development and marketing programs 
these initiatives have significantly decreased cash utilization  from just under million per quarter in the second half of to an average of approximately  per quarter during as of december   we had a total cash balance of approximately  in march  we closed on a second tranche of our private placement of units of series b convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of series b convertible preferred stock with gross proceeds of approximately  based on our current projections  we believe our current cash resources  which includes the funds we received from the private placements we completed in and  are sufficient to fund our normal operations into the first quarter of depending upon the results of the company s financing and partnering activities and sales efforts  we may make additional cost reductions as required to accomplish this goal 
our pressure cycling technology employs a unique approach that we believe has the potential for broad applications in a number of established and emerging life sciences areas  including sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies  pathogen inactivation  protein purification  control of chemical enzymatic reactions  and immunodiagnostics 
since we began operations as pressure biosciences in february  we have focused substantially all of our research and development and commercialization efforts on sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies 
our business strategy is to commercialize pressure cycling technology in the area of sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies sample preparation 
we also plan to pursue the further development and commercialization of pct in other life sciences applications  which could include working with various strategic partners that have greater scientific  and regulatory  expertise in the respective applications than we do 
we plan to focus primarily on the application of pct enhanced protein digestion for the mass spectrometry market and the advantages of pct in this market  and the use of pct in biomarker discovery  soil and plant biology  counter bio terror and tissue pathology applications 
to support our current strategy  our primary focus is the execution of our commercialization plan for pct in sample preparation 
we remain focused on projects that we feel represent near term revenue opportunities 
if we are successful commercializing our technology in the sample preparation market  we believe that our financial results will be positively affected by a combination of the revenue from the sale  lease  and rental of the barocycler instruments  the sale of other pct equipment  such as the pct shredder  and by the recurring revenue streams that we hope to realize from the sale of the single use pulse tubes  pct dependent kits  and extended service contracts on our instrumentation 
we believe the recurring revenue streams that could be generated from our instruments in the field is a very important component of our future financial success 
therefore  we believe that it is important for us to continue to focus on increasing the number of installed barocyclers in the field 
to this end  we have offered our prospective customers the opportunity to lease or rent the barocycler instruments  and in some cases we have engaged in short term reagent rental agreements 
under a reagent rental agreement we provide the customer with a barocycler instrument in exchange for a minimum purchase commitment of consumable products 
while these arrangements do not provide us with the immediate revenue of a sale  they do serve to expand the utilization of pct and they provide a stream of revenue in the form of rental payments and consumable purchases 
we define sales  leases  and rentals of barocycler instruments as revenue generating installations 
we also derive revenues from small business innovation research sbir grants awarded to us by the national institutes of health 
these types of grants allow us to bill the federal agency for work that we are planning to perform as part of the development  and commercialization  of our technology 
additionally  if our work in sbir phase i grants is successful  then we expect to apply for larger nih sbir phase ii grants 
to date we have been awarded two national institutes of health nih small business innovation research sbir phase i grants and one sbir phase ii grant 
both of our phase i grants have been completed 
the data on one of the phase i grants was the basis for the submission  and subsequent award  of our phase ii award of approximately  the phase ii grant is for work in the area of the use of pct to extract protein biomarkers  sub cellular molecular complexes  and organelles  with the expectation that these studies will ultimately lead to the release of a new  commercially available pct based system  with validated protocols  end user kits  and other consumables intended for the extraction of clinically important protein biomarkers  sub cellular molecular complexes  and organelles 
as of december   the amount of the phase ii sbir grant available to fund future research was  we completed our series a private placement and the first tranche of our series b private placement in  pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and  shares of series b convertible preferred stock  together with warrants  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of  we also closed the sale of a second tranche of  shares of series b convertible preferred stock and warrants in the series b private placement on march  with gross proceeds of we believe we have sufficient cash resources to fund normal operations into the first quarter of due to the restructuring measures we have undertaken and the  we received in connection with our and private placements 
we believe we will need substantial additional capital to fund our current operations beyond the first quarter of if we are able to obtain additional capital or otherwise increase our revenues  we may increase spending in specific research and development applications and engineering projects and may hire additional sales personnel or invest in targeted marketing programs 
in the event that we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be required to limit or cease our operations  pursue a plan to sell our operating assets  or otherwise modify our business strategy  which could materially harm our future business prospects 
results of operations years ended december  as compared to revenue we had total revenue of  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the prior year 
pct products  services  other 
revenue from the sale of pct products and services was  in as compared to  in this increase in revenue in was driven primarily by the installation of a total of barocycler instruments during as compared to during  and the launch of the pct microtube adapter kit 
when we install instrumentation under lease or rental agreements  we record the revenue over the life of the agreement 
unit installations domestic international total installations we expect the number of units installed will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to gain commercial awareness of our technology  although we may experience some delays in customer purchases due to current economic conditions in the united states and globally 
we continue to expect that some portion of future installations will be for the smaller  lower priced  barocycler nep model and some will be placed under lease or short term rental agreements 
therefore  we expect that the average revenue per installation may continue to fluctuate from period to period as we continue to drive our installed base and commercialize pct 
we also expect that as we continue to expand the installed base of barocycler instruments in the field  we will realize increasing revenue from the sale of consumable products and extended service contracts 
in the short term  these recurring revenue streams may continue to fluctuate from period to period 
grant revenue 
during  we recorded  of grant revenue as compared to  in grant revenue recorded during was related to the  sbir phase ii grant that we were awarded in june and to an sbir phase i grant of approximately  awarded in january the amount of grant revenue that we recognize in any given period is dependent upon the level of resources we devote to grant related work in the period under existing grant awards 
cost of pct products and services the cost of pct products and services was  for the year ended december   compared to  in the increase in cost of pct products and services was due primarily to the increase in the number of units installed under sale  lease  or rental arrangements during the period and  to a lesser extent  costs associated with our june launch of our pct microtube adapter kits 
costs of pct products and services as a percentage of pct revenue decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of pct products and services as a percentage of pct revenue was due primarily to the sale of barocycler units that were demonstration models that had been previously expensed resulting in a lower cost of pct products in the current year 
the company also recovered four units from the field that were previously expensed to costs of pct products and services 
the prior year cost of pct products and services as a percentage of pct revenue reflected our sale of barocycler instruments to our foreign distributors at discounted prices during we believe that our cost of pct products and services will decrease as a percentage of revenue as we continue to install more instruments  convert short term rentals to direct sales  and sell more consumable products  such as pulse tubes and proteosolve kits 
however  we expect our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as we continue to sell  lease  or rent a varying mix of barocycler instrumentation and consumable products 
research and development research and development expenditures decreased to  during from  in this decline in r d expenses was primarily due to the significant restructuring and cost reduction programs that we initiated in the second half of  including the termination of seven r d employees 
the headcount in r d during the year ended december  was three  compared to ten during the same period in the decline in expenses was also due to a significant decrease in the number of r d projects we funded during research and development expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation in and  respectively 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased to  in from  for the year ended december  this decline in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to the significant restructuring and cost reduction programs that we initiated in the second half of  including the termination of four sales directors and one marketing assistant 
the headcount in selling and marketing during the year ended december  was five  compared to ten during a significant decrease in advertising  exhibit booth rental  and travel expense also contributed to the reduction in overall selling and marketing expense incurred 
selling and marketing expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative costs totaled  in the year ended december   as compared to  in the decline in expenses was due to compensation savings from reduced headcount and reduced board member fees offset by increases in investor relations activities 
during the years ended december  and  general and administrative expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense  respectively 
the year ended december  includes a grant of stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in total to our employees and our four independent directors  resulting in a charge of  during the year ended december  also includes a one time charge of  of non cash stock based compensation expense in connection with the grant of a non qualified  fully vested option to purchase  shares of our common stock to our new independent director 
the same period in includes a one time charge of  of non cash stock based compensation expense in connection with the grant of non qualified  fully vested stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock to each of our four independent directors 
operating loss our operating loss was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the comparable period in  a decrease of  or 
during the second half of  we initiated a number of cost reduction measures  including a comprehensive restructuring program to significantly reduce costs  centralize core operations  and refocus our business strategy in specific areas where our products had found significant initial market acceptance 
the restructuring program included a reduction in personnel of twelve full time employees  reduction in travel and meeting attendance for all personnel  reduced board of directors fees  decreases in the base salary of most of our employees and all of our executive officers  a shutdown of our r d facility in rockville  md  a consolidation of our research and development activities in massachusetts  and delay or cancellation of several research and development and marketing programs 
these initiatives have significantly decreased our rate of cash utilization  from just under million per quarter in the second half of to an average of approximately  per quarter for interest income interest income totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower average cash balances and lower yields on these balances during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in several high yield cds matured in income taxes in the year ended december   we recorded a refund of income taxes of  due to provisions in the american recovery and reinvestment act of relating to net operating loss carry backs 
the cash was received in august there was no provision for an income tax benefit during the same period in aside from the impact of the passage of this law  we do not expect any additional income tax benefits relating to carry backs to prior periods 
if we are successful in commercializing pct and in generating operating income  then we may be able to utilize certain net operating losses we may have at the time against such future operating profits 
net loss during the year ended december   we recorded a net loss applicable to common shareholders of  or per share  as compared to  or per share in the same period of our net loss in the year ended december  was lower than the corresponding net loss in the same period in as the result of increased revenue  the income tax benefit  and lower operating costs  as described above 
for  the difference between net loss applicable to common shareholders and net loss relates to the beneficial conversion associated with the intrinsic value of the series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock 
liquidity and financial condition as of december   our working capital position was  the primary components of which were cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses  and deposits  partially offset by accounts payable  accrued employee compensation  and other accrued expenses 
as of december   our working capital balance was  the primary components of which were cash and cash equivalents  income taxes receivable  prepaid expenses  and deposits 
we expect to continue to fund our operations from our working capital balance 
during  we took a number of cost reduction measures  including a comprehensive restructuring program to significantly reduce costs  centralize core operations  and refocus our business strategy in specific areas where our products have found significant market acceptance 
the restructuring program included a reduction in personnel of eight full time employees of the workforce  reduction in travel and meeting attendance for all personnel  continued reduction in investor relations activities  decreases in the base salary of most of our employees and all of our executive officers  a shutdown of the our r d facility in rockville  md  a consolidation of our research and development activities in massachusetts and delay of several research and development and marketing programs 
these initiatives significantly decreased our rate of cash utilization  from just under million per quarter to an average of just under  per quarter during on february   we completed a private placement  pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  units the series a units for a purchase price of per unit the series a purchase price  resulting in gross proceeds to us of  the series a private placement 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a further description of the series a convertible preferred stock and warrants issued in the series a private placement 
on november   we sold an aggregate of  units the series b units of series b convertible preferred stock  par value per share the series b convertible preferred stock and warrants for a purchase price of per series b unit the series b purchase price  resulting in gross proceeds to us of 
this is the first tranche of a million private placement the series b private placement 
we closed on the second tranche of the series b private placement on march  with the sale of an additional  series b units with gross proceeds of  each series b unit consists of i one share of a newly created series b convertible preferred stock  convertible into shares of our common stock and ii a warrant to purchase one share of series b convertible preferred stock at an exercise price equal to per share share for the warrants issued in november and at an exercise price of per share for the warrants issued in march  in each case with a term expiring on august  series b warrant 
in connection with the series b private placement  we paid a finder s fee of  plus warrants to purchase  shares of series b convertible preferred stock at per share  expiring august  on december   we received  from one of our distributors in the escrow account for the private placement 
prior to february   the distributor requested that the  be used as payment for anticipated future purchases of our pct instrument and consumable products  and not for an investment in the private placement 
this amount was recorded as deferred revenue in as of december   the remaining unused balance of  was returned to our distributor 
we believe that because of the cost restructuring measures we have undertaken  together with the  we received in connection with our and private placements of units  consisting of series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock and warrants  we have sufficient cash resources to fund normal operations into the first quarter of depending upon the results of the company s financing and partnering activities and sales efforts  we may make additional cost reductions as required to accomplish this goal 
we believe we will need substantial additional capital to fund our current operations beyond the first quarter of if we are able to obtain additional capital or otherwise increase our revenues  we may increase spending in specific research and development applications and engineering projects and may hire additional sales personnel or invest in targeted marketing programs 
in the event that we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be required to limit or cease our operations  pursue a plan to sell our operating assets  or otherwise modify our business strategy  which could materially harm our future business prospects 
net cash used in operations during was  as compared to net cash used in operations of  during the decrease in cash used in operations in as compared to is principally the result of the increased revenues and lower operating expenses in net cash used in investing activities during was  as compared to net cash used in investing activities of  in the prior year 
during year ended december   we installed barocycler instruments under collaboration or lease agreements while selling six demonstration units 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was for the purchase of furniture and fixtures associated with our move to new corporate offices  and for barocycler instruments that we purchased and installed under collaboration or lease agreements 
net cash provided by financing activities during was  as noted above  during we received the proceeds from the series a private placement and the first tranche of the series b private placement 
the expenses related to the series a private placement totaled approximately  and the expenses related to series b private placement totaled approximately  including the finder s fees in the series b private placement 
in connection with the series b private placement  we paid a finder s fee of  plus warrants to purchase  shares of series b convertible preferred stock at per share  expiring august  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  also included a stock warrant exercise 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was due to an exercise of employee stock options to purchase shares of our common stock 
commitments and contingencies royalty commitments in  we acquired our initial equity interest in bioseq  inc  which at the time was developing our original pressure cycling technology 
bioseq  inc acquired its pressure cycling technology from biomolecular assays  inc bma under a technology transfer and patent assignment agreement 
in  we purchased all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of bioseq  inc  and at such time  the technology transfer and patent assignment agreement was amended to require us to pay bma a royalty on our sales of products or services that incorporate or utilize the original pressure cycling technology that bioseq  inc acquired from biomolecular assays  inc 
we are also required to pay bma of the proceeds from any sale  transfer or license of all or any portion of the original pressure cycling technology 
these payment obligations terminate in during the year ended december  and  we incurred approximately  and  respectively in royalty expense associated with our obligation to bma 
in connection with our acquisition of bioseq  inc  we licensed certain limited rights to the original pressure cycling technology back to bma 
this license is non exclusive and limits the use of the original pressure cycling technology by bma solely for molecular applications in scientific research and development and in scientific plant research and development 
bma is required to pay us a royalty equal to of any license or other fees and royalties  but not including research support and similar payments  it receives in connection with any sale  assignment  license or other transfer of any rights granted to bma under the license 
bma must pay us these royalties until the expiration of the patents held by bioseq  inc in  which we anticipate will be we have not received any royalty payments from bma under this license 
purchase commitments on december   we submitted a purchase order to source scientific  llc  the manufacturer of the company s pct barocycler instrumentation  for barocycler nep units and barocycler nep units with various spare parts 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase order  we placed a deposit with source scientific  llc  of approximately  representing approximately of the expected total value of the order 
the purchase price for the nep units and nep units is based upon a fixed bill of materials 
we will be billed for the unpaid purchase price of each unit at the time each unit is completed and ready for sale 
severance and change of control agreements each of our executive officers is entitled to receive a severance payment if terminated by the company without cause 
the severance benefits would include a payment in an amount equal to one year of each executive officer s annualized base salary compensation plus accrued paid time off 
additionally  each executive officer will be entitled to receive medical and dental insurance coverage for one year following the date of termination 
the total commitment related to these agreements in the aggregate is approximately million 
each of our executive officers  other than mr 
richard t 
schumacher  our president and chief executive officer  is entitled to receive a change of control payment in an amount equal to one year of such executive officer s annualized base salary compensation  accrued paid time off  and medical and dental coverage  in the event of a change of control of the company 
in the case of mr 
schumacher  this payment would be equal to two years of annualized base salary compensation  accrued paid time off  and two years of medical and dental coverage 
the total commitment related to these agreements in the aggregate is approximately million 
the severance payment is meant to induce the executive to become an employee of the company and to remain in the employ of the company  in general  and particularly in the occurrence of a change in control 
lease commitments we lease building space under non cancelable leases in south easton  ma and in the venture development center at the university of massachusetts in boston 
following is a schedule by years of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases with initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december  year ending december thereafter total minimum payments required critical accounting policies fasb codification we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board  fasb 
the fasb sets gaap that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
references to gaap issued by the fasb in this report are to the fasb accounting standards codification  sometimes referred to as the codification or asc 
the fasb finalized the codification effective for periods ending on or after september  prior fasb standards like fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  are no longer being issued by the fasb 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of pressure biosciences  inc  and its wholly owned subsidiary pbi bioseq  inc 
use of estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  significant estimates were made in projecting future cash flows to quantify impairment of assets  deferred tax assets  the costs associated with fulfilling our warranty obligations for the instruments that we sell  and the estimates employed in our calculation of fair value of stock options awarded 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when realized or earned when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our current instruments  the barocycler nep and nep  require a basic level of instrumentation expertise to set up for initial operation 
to support a favorable first experience for our customers  we send a highly trained technical representative to the customer site to install every barocycler that we sell  lease  or rent through our domestic sales force 
the installation process includes uncrating and setting up the instrument  followed by introductory user training 
product revenue related to current barocycler instrumentation is recognized upon the completion of the installation and introductory training process of the instrumentation at the customer location  for domestic installations 
product revenue related to sales of pct instrumentation to our foreign distributors is recognized upon shipment through a common carrier 
we provide for the expected costs of warranty upon the recognition of revenue for the sales of our instrumentation 
our sales arrangements do not provide our customers with a right of return 
product revenue related to our consumable products such as pulse tubes  microtubes  and application specific kits is recorded upon shipment through a common carrier 
shipping costs are included in sales and marketing expense 
any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
in accordance with fasb asc  leases  we account for our lease agreements under the operating method 
we record revenue over the life of the lease term and we record depreciation expense on a straight line basis over the thirty six month estimated useful life of the barocycler instrument 
the depreciation expense associated with assets under lease agreement is included in the cost of pct products and services line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
many of our lease and rental agreements allow the lessee to purchase the instrument at any point during the term of the agreement with partial or full credit for payments previously made 
we pay all maintenance costs associated with the instrument during the term of the leases 
revenue from government grants is recorded when expenses are incurred under the grant in accordance with the terms of the grant award 
our transactions sometimes involve multiple elements ie  products and services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is recognized in accordance with fasb asc multiple element arrangements 
under this method  if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is based on fair value and determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  and recognized at the time of delivery 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available 
we provide certain customers with extended service contracts and  to the extent vsoe is established  these service revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
intangible assets we have classified as intangible assets  costs associated with the fair value of certain assets of businesses acquired 
intangible assets relate to the remaining value of acquired patents associated with pct 
the cost of these acquired patents is amortized on a straight line basis over sixteen years 
we annually review our intangible assets for impairment 
when impairment is indicated  any excess of carrying value over fair value is recorded as a loss 
an impairment analysis of intangible assets as of december  concluded they were not impaired 
long lived assets and deferred costs in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant  and equipment  if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows related to the long lived assets 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the asset and record the impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results 
while our current and historical operating losses and cash flow are indicators of impairment  we performed an impairment analysis at december  and determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
recent accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fasb asc  generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the sole source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles 
pursuant to the provisions of fasb asc  the company has updated references to gaap in its financial statements issued for the period ended december  the adoption of fasb asc did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
on january   the company adopted fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
fasb asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities  and expands disclosure requirements regarding the fair value measurement 
fasb asc does not expand the use of fair value measurements 
this statement  as issued  is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
there was no significant effect on our financial statements 
we do not believe that the adoption of fasb asc to non financial assets and liabilities will significantly affect our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb asc  business combinations and fasb asc  consolidations 
fasb asc significantly changes the accounting for business combinations 
under fasb asc  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date at fair value with limited exceptions 
fasb asc further changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items  including acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred  non controlling interests formerly known as minority interests see fasb asc discussion below will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
in april  the fasb issued fasb asc  intangibles other than goodwill which requires that an entity consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements  or a consideration of market participant assumptions in the absence of historical experience 
fasb asc also requires entities to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entity s intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
we have adopted fasb asc the adoption of this statement does not have any impact to our financial statements 
fasb asc establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of non controlling interests minority interests as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to non controlling interests will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
fasb asc clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
fasb asc also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
we have adopted fasb asc and the statement does not have a material affect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities  the method of accounting for such instruments under fasb asc and its related interpretations  and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
we adopted fasb asc and our adoption of fasb asc did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on june   the company adopted fasb asc  subsequent events  which requires disclosure of the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements 
the adoption of fasb asc did not have a material impact on our financial statements
