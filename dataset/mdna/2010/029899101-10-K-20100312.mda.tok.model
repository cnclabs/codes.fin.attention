competition the businesses of gswc and ccwc are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities  municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories 
gswc and ccwc compete with governmental agencies and other investor owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms  availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis 
awr s other subsidiary  asus  actively competes for business with other investor owned utilities  other third party providers of water and or wastewater services  and governmental entities on the basis of price and quality of service 
employee relations gswc had employees as of december  as compared to at december  nineteen positions in gswc s bear valley electric customer service area are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers  which expired in gswc is currently in negotiations with this union on a new agreement 
sixty three employees in gswc s region ii ratemaking district are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the utility workers union of america  which expires in gswc has no other unionized employees

table of contents forward looking information this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements regarding our goals  beliefs  plans or current expectations  taking into account the information currently available to management 
forward looking statements are not statements of historical facts 
for example  when we use words such as believes  anticipates  expects  plans  estimates  intends  may and other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcome  we are making forward looking statements 
such statements address future events and conditions concerning such matters as our ability to raise capital  capital expenditures  earnings  litigation  rates  water sales  water quality and other regulatory matters  adequacy of water supplies  our ability to recover electric  natural gas and water supply costs from ratepayers  contract operations  liquidity and capital resources  and accounting matters 
we caution you that any forward looking statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements  by reason of factors such as changes in utility regulation  recovery of regulatory assets not yet included in rates  future economic conditions which affect changes in customer demand and changes in water and energy supply costs  changes in pension and post retirement benefit plan costs  future climatic conditions  delays in customer payments or price redeterminations or equitable adjustments on contracts executed by asus and its subsidiaries  potential assessments for failure to meet interim targets for the purchase of renewable energy  and legislative  legal proceedings  regulatory and other circumstances affecting anticipated revenues and costs 

table of contents item a risk factors you should carefully read the risks described below and other information in this form k in order to understand certain of the risks of our business 
our business is heavily regulated and  as a result  decisions by regulatory agencies and changes in laws and regulations can significantly affect our business our revenues depend substantially on the rates and fees we charge our customers and the ability to recover our costs on a timely basis  including the ability to recover the costs of purchased water  groundwater assessments  electric power  natural gas  chemicals  water treatment  security at water facilities and preventative maintenance and emergency repairs 
any delays by either the cpuc or the acc in granting rate relief to cover increased operating and capital costs at our public utilities or delays in obtaining approval of our requests for equitable adjustments or price redetermination for contracted services from the us government may adversely affect our financial performance 
we may file for interim rates in california in situations where there may be delays in granting final rate relief during a general rate case proceeding 
if the cpuc approves lower rates  the cpuc will require us to refund to customers the difference between the interim rates and the rates approved by the cpuc 
similarly  if the cpuc approves rates that are higher than the interim rates  the cpuc may authorize us to recover the difference between the interim rates and the final rates 
regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings  affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses  may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses and could result in impairment of goodwill if the decision affects ccwc or asus 
management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  liabilities and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and or reserves as deemed necessary 
in the event that our assessment of the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect  we will adjust the associated regulatory asset or liability to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances 
management also reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually 
a change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets  a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our costs or material impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
ccwc has million of goodwill which could be at risk for potential impairment if future requested rate increases are not granted by the acc 
asus also has million of goodwill which may be at risk for potential impairment if requested price redeterminations and equitable adjustments are not granted 
we are also  in some cases  required to estimate future expenses and in others  we are required to incur the expense before recovering costs 
as a result  our revenues and earnings may fluctuate depending on the accuracy of our estimates  the timing of our investments or expenses or other factors 
if expenses increase significantly over a short period of time  we may experience delays in recovery of these expenses  the inability to recover carrying costs for these expenses and increased risks of regulatory disallowances or write offs 
regulatory agencies may also change their rules and policies which may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 
changes in policies of the us government may also adversely affect our military base contract operations 
in certain circumstances  the us government may be unwilling or unable to appropriate funds to pay costs mandated by changes in rules and policies of state regulatory agencies 
the us government may disagree with the increases that we request and may delay approval of requests for equitable adjustment or redetermination of prices which could adversely affect our anticipated rates of return 
we may also be subject to fines or penalties if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws  regulations or orders applicable to our businesses  unless we appeal this determination or our appeal of an adverse determination is denied 
our costs involved in maintaining water quality and complying with environmental regulation have increased and are expected to continue to increase our capital and operating costs have increased substantially as a result of increases in environmental regulation arising from increases in the cost of disposing of residuals from our water treatment plants  upgrading and building new water treatment plants  monitoring compliance activities and securing alternative supplies when necessary 
our public utilities may be able to recover these costs through the ratemaking process 
we may also be able to recover these costs under contractual arrangements 
in certain circumstances  costs may be recoverable from parties responsible or potentially responsible for contamination  either voluntarily or through specific court action 
we may also incur significant costs in connection with seeking to recover costs due to contamination of water supplies 
our ability to recover these types of costs also depends upon a variety of factors  including approval of rate increases  the willingness of potentially responsible parties to settle litigation and otherwise address the contamination and 
table of contents the extent and magnitude of the contamination 
we can give no assurance regarding the adequacy of any such recovery to offset the costs associated with the contamination or the cost of recovery of these costs 
our subsidiaries operating water and or wastewater systems on military bases are also subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
the contracts provide various mechanisms for recovery of costs  including increasing revenues through change in conditions provisions and equitable adjustment procedures 
our contracts with the us government are  however  subject to the anti deficiency act 
as a result  our recovery of these costs may depend upon congressional action to appropriate funds 
additional risks associated with our public utility operations our operating costs have increased and are expected to continue to increase as a result of groundwater contamination our operations are impacted by groundwater contamination in certain service territories 
we have taken a number of steps to address contamination  including the removal of wells from service  decreasing the amount of groundwater pumped from wells in order to slow the movement of plumes of contaminated water  constructing water treatment facilities and securing alternative sources of supply from other areas not affected by the contamination 
in some cases  potentially responsible parties have reimbursed us for some or all of our costs 
in other cases  we have taken legal action against parties believed to be potentially responsible for the contamination 
to date  the cpuc has permitted us to establish memorandum accounts in california for potential recovery of these types of costs 
we can give no assurance regarding the outcome of litigation arising out of contamination or our ability to recover these costs in the future 
persons who are potentially responsible for causing the contamination of groundwater supplies have asserted claims against water distributors on a variety of theories and have thus far brought the water distributors including us within the class of potentially responsible parties in federal court actions pending in los angeles county 
this increases the costs and risks of seeking recovery of these costs 
management believes that rate recovery  proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to appropriately manage these types of claims 
however  such claims  if ultimately resolved unfavorably to us  could  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of uncontrollable factors the adequacy of our water supplies varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including rainfall  runoff  flood control and availability of reservoir storage  availability of colorado river water and imported water from northern california  the amount of useable water stored in reservoirs and groundwater basins  the amount of water used by our customers and others  water quality  legal limitations on production  diversion  storage  conveyance and use  and climate change 
population growth and increases in the amount of water used in california and arizona have caused increased stress on surface water supplies and groundwater basins 
in addition  new court ordered pumping restrictions on water obtained from the sacramento san joaquin delta have decreased the amount of water metropolitan water district of southern california mwd is able to import from northern california 
we are acting to secure additional supplies from conservation  desalination and water transfers  however  we cannot predict to what extent these efforts will be successful and sustainable 
ccwc obtains its water supply from operating wells and from the colorado river through the central arizona project  or cap 
ccwc s water supply may be subject to interruption or reduction if there is an interruption or reduction in water supplies available to cap 
in addition  ccwc s ability to provide water service to new real estate developments is dependent upon ccwc s ability to meet the requirements of the arizona department of water resources regarding the ccwc s assured water supply account 
water shortages may adversely affect our supply mix  for instance  causing increased reliance upon more expensive water sources  adversely affect our operating costs  for instance  by increasing the cost of producing water from more highly contaminated aquifers  
table of contents result in an increase in our capital expenditures  for example by requiring the construction of pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply  new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers  and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water  and adversely affect the volume of water sold as a result of mandatory or voluntary conservation efforts by customers 
we may be able to recover increased operating and capital costs through the ratemaking process 
gswc implemented a modified supply cost balancing account to track and recover costs from our supply mix changes and rate changes  as authorized by the cpuc 
we may also recover costs from certain third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
our liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in water supply costs we obtain our water supplies for gswc and ccwc from a variety of sources 
for example  water is pumped from aquifers within our service areas to meet a portion of the demands of our customers 
when water produced from wells in those areas is insufficient to meet customer demand or when such production is interrupted  we have purchased water from other suppliers 
as a result  our cost of providing  distributing and treating water for our customers use can vary significantly 
furthermore  imported water wholesalers  such as mwd and cap may not always have an adequate supply of water to sell to us 
our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by increases in maintenance costs due to our aging infrastructure some of our systems in california are more than years old 
we have experienced a number of leaks and water quality and mechanical problems in some of these older systems 
in addition  well and pump maintenance expenses are affected by labor and material costs and more stringent water discharge requirements 
these costs can and do increase unexpectedly and in substantial amounts 
we include increases in maintenance costs in each general rate case filed by our rate regulated public utilities for possible recovery 
however  we estimate the amount of expenses expected to be incurred during future years in california 
we may not recover overages from those estimates in rates  which may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by our conservation efforts conservation by all customer classes at gswc and ccwc is a top priority 
however  customer conservation can result in lower volumes of water sold 
we are also experiencing a decline in per residential customer water usage due to the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances by residential consumers  and perhaps  efforts by our customers to reduce costs as a result of adverse economic conditions 
our public utilities businesses are heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates charged to our residential customers for the volume of water used 
the rates we charge for water are regulated by the cpuc and the acc and may not be unilaterally adjusted to reflect changes in demand 
declining usage also negatively impacts our long term operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or if growth in the residential customer base does not occur to the extent necessary to offset the per customer residential usage decline 
we implemented a water revenue adjustment mechanism at gswc which has the effect of reducing  for the most part  the adverse impacts of our customers conservation efforts on earnings 
our earnings may be affected  to some extent  by weather during different seasons the demand for water and electricity varies by season 
for instance  most water consumption occurs during the third quarter of each year when weather in california and arizona tends to be hot and dry 
during unusually wet weather  our customers generally use less water 
gswc implemented a conservation rate design and a water revenue adjustment mechanism  for regions ii and iii in late november  and for region i s ratemaking areas in september  which should help mitigate fluctuations in revenues and earnings due to changes in water consumption in california 
ccwc s revenues and profitability will  however  continue to be impacted by changes in water consumption in arizona 
the demand for electricity in our electric customer service area is greatly affected by winter snows 
an increase in winter snows reduces the use of snowmaking machines at ski resorts in the big bear area and  as a result  reduces our electric revenues 
likewise  unseasonably warm weather during a skiing season may result in temperatures too high for snowmaking conditions  which also reduces our electric revenues 
in november  gswc implemented a new base revenue 
table of contents requirement adjustment mechanism  as approved by the cpuc  for our electric business which should help mitigate fluctuations in the revenues and earnings of our electric business due to changes in the amount of electricity used by gswc s customers 
our liquidity  and in certain circumstances  earnings  may be adversely affected by increases in electricity and natural gas prices in california we purchase most of our electric energy sold to customers in our electric customer service area from others under purchased power contracts 
in addition to purchased power contracts  we purchase additional energy from the spot market to meet peak demand 
we may sell surplus power to the spot market during times of reduced energy demand 
we also operate a natural gas fueled megawatt  or mw  generator in our electric service area 
the cpuc permits us to recover energy purchase costs from customers  up to an annual weighted average cost of per mwh each year through august we are required to write off costs in excess of this cap 
as a result  we are at risk for increases in spot market prices of electricity purchased and for decreases in spot market prices for electricity sold 
unexpected generator downtime or a failure to perform by any of the counterparties to our electric and natural gas purchase contracts could further increase our exposure to fluctuating natural gas and electric prices 
changes in electricity prices also affected the unrealized gains and losses on our block forward purchased power contracts that qualify as derivative instruments as we adjusted the asset or liability on these contracts to reflect the fair market value of the contracts at the end of each month 
the cpuc has authorized us to establish a memorandum account to track the changes in the fair market value of our new power purchased contracts that became effective on january  as a result  unrealized gains and losses on these purchased power contracts will not impact earnings 
our assets are subject to condemnation municipalities and other government subdivisions may  in certain circumstances  seek to acquire certain of our assets through eminent domain proceedings 
it is generally our practice to contest these proceedings which may be costly and may divert the attention of management from the operation of our business 
if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring our assets  there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the assets acquired or be able to recover all charges associated with divesting these assets 
additional risks associated with our contracted services we derive revenues from contract operations primarily from the operation and maintenance of water and or wastewater systems at military bases and the construction of water and wastewater improvements to the infrastructure on these bases 
as a result  these operations are subject to risks that are different than those of our public utility operations 
our operations and maintenance contracts on military bases create certain risks that are different from that of our regulated utility operations we have entered into contracts to provide water and or wastewater services at military bases pursuant to year contracts  subject to termination  in whole or in part  for the convenience of the us government 
in addition  the us government may stop work under the terms of the contracts  delay performance of our obligations under the contracts or modify the contracts at its convenience 
our contract pricing was based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials 
we may be unable to recover all costs if any of these assumptions are inaccurate or if all costs that we may incur in connection with performing the work were not considered 
our operations and maintenance contracts are also subject to periodic price adjustments at the time of price redetermination or in connection with requests for equitable adjustments or other changes permitted by the terms of the contracts 
the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
prices are also subject to equitable adjustment based upon changes in circumstances and changes in wages and fringe benefits to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
we have experienced delays in the redetermination of prices following completion of the first two years of operation under our operation and maintenance contracts in effect for more than two years 
we have also experienced delays in obtaining a final equitable adjustment of prices for the significantly higher infrastructure at certain of the bases than that described by the us government in its request for proposal 
these delays have negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows 
similar delays on other contracts may impact our future earnings and cash flows 

table of contents we are required to record all costs incurred under these types of contracts as these costs are incurred 
as a result  we may record losses associated with unanticipated conditions and emergency work at the time such expenses occur 
we recognize revenue for such work as  and to the extent that  our requests for equitable adjustments are approved 
delays in obtaining approval of equitable adjustments can negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to audits  cost review and investigations by contracting oversight agencies 
during the course of an audit  the oversight agency may disallow costs 
such cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenues 
payment under these contracts is subject to appropriations by congress 
we may experience delays in receiving payment or delays in redetermination of prices or other price adjustments due to cancelled or delayed appropriations specific to our projects or reductions in government spending for the military generally or military base operations specifically 
appropriations and the timing of payment may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures for the military generally or military base operations specifically 
in addition  we must maintain the proper management of water and wastewater facilities  employ state certified and other qualified employees to support the operation of these facilities and otherwise comply with contract requirements 
risks associated with the collection of wastewater are different  in some respects  from that of our water utility operations the wastewater collection system operations of our subsidiaries providing wastewater services on military bases are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks 
if collection or sewage systems fail  overflow or do not operate properly  untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers  causing damage to persons or property  injury to aquatic life and economic damages  which may not be recoverable 
this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding  which are common causes of sewer overflows and system failures 
liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow  our losses might not be covered by insurance policies or we may find it difficult to secure insurance for this business in the future at acceptable rates 
our contracts for the construction of infrastructure improvements on military bases create risks that are different  in some respects  from that of our operations and maintenance contracts we have entered into contract modifications with the us government and in some cases third parties for the construction of new water and or wastewater infrastructure at the military bases 
most of these contracts are firm fixed price contracts 
under firm fixed price contracts  we benefit from cost savings and earnings  but are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under extenuating circumstances  the us government has approved increased cost change orders 
we recognize revenues from these types of contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this accounting practice results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on periodic estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability as the construction projects progress 
we establish prices for these types of firm fixed price contracts based  in part  on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our contracted business operations and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by disputes with the us government regarding our performance of contract services on military bases if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows will be adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with the terms of one or more of our us government contracts  other agreements with the us government or us government regulations and statutes  we could be suspended or barred from future us government contracts for a period of time and be subject to possible damages  fines and penalties and damage to our reputation in the water and wastewater industry 

table of contents we depend  to some extent  upon subcontractors to assist us in the performance of contracted services on military bases we rely  to some extent  on subcontractors to assist us in the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at a number of military bases  subject to our existing contracts with the us government 
the failure of any of these subcontractors to perform services for us in accordance with the terms of our contracts with the us government could result in the termination of our contracts to provide water and or wastewater services at these bases  a loss of revenues or increases in costs to correct a subcontractor s performance failures 
we are able to mitigate these risks  in part  by obtaining  and requiring our subcontractors to obtain  performance bonds 
we are also required to make a good faith effort to achieve our small business subcontracting plan goals pursuant to us government regulation 
if we fail to use good faith efforts to meet these goals  the us government may assess damages against us at the end of the contract or  in some cases  at the end of each price redetermination period 
the us government has the right to offset claimed damages against any amounts owed to us 
we also rely on third party manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our construction projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount of costs we incur for these projects exceeds the amount we have estimated in our bid  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were needed 
if these subcontractors fail to perform services to be provided to us or fail to provide us with the proper equipment or materials  we may be penalized for their failure to perform 
we continue to incur costs associated with the expansion of our contract activities we continue to incur additional costs in connection with the attempted expansion of our contract operations associated with the preparation of bids for new contracts for contract operations on military bases and compliance with regulatory requirements associated with our water marketing efforts 
our ability to recover these costs and to earn a profit on our contract operations will depend upon the extent to which we are successful in obtaining new contracts on military bases and satisfying regulatory requirements associated with our water marketing efforts and recovering these costs and other costs from new contract revenues 
other risks our business requires significant capital expenditures the utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums of money for additions to  or replacement of  our property  plant and equipment at our california and arizona utilities 
we obtain funds for these capital projects from operations  contributions by developers and others and advances from developers which are repaid over a period of time at no interest 
we also periodically borrow money or issue equity for these purposes 
in addition  we have a syndicated bank credit facility that is partially used for these purposes 
we cannot provide assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return 
our subsidiaries providing water and wastewater services on military bases also expect to incur significant capital expenditures 
to the extent that the us government does not reimburse us for these expenditures as the work is performed  the us government will repay us over time with interest 
however  if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows will be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by a financial crisis due to market events that occurred in  our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses increased significantly in we include increases in pension and post retirement cost in each general rate case filed by our public utilities for possible recovery 
however  we estimate the amount of expenses expected to be incurred during future years in california 
the actual cost may vary significantly from our estimates due to changes in the market value of the assets in the plans and changes in the discount rates used to estimate the amount of our pension and post retirement plan liabilities 
we 
table of contents may not recover overages from those estimates in rates  which may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and liquidity  unless authorized by the cpuc 
we obtain funds from external sources to finance our on going capital expenditures 
access to external financing on reasonable terms depends  in part  on conditions in the debt and equity markets 
when business and market conditions deteriorate  we may no longer have access to the capital markets on reasonable terms 
our ability to obtain funds is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity to third parties or obtaining funds from our revolving credit facility which expires in june in the event of renewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets  additional consolidation of the financial services industry  significant financial service institution failures or our inability to renew or replace our existing revolving credit facility on attractive terms  it may become necessary for us to seek funds from other sources on unattractive terms 
moreover  we also have goodwill at ccwc and asus that may be adversely impacted if economic conditions worsen 
we are unable to predict at this time how we may otherwise be impacted by a financial crisis 
our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in our long term debt agreements and credit facility could trigger prepayment obligations our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our long term debt agreements could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay or refinance these borrowings before their due dates on less favorable terms 
if we are forced to repay or refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and interest rates 
we are a holding company that depends on cash flow from gswc to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all operations and our only significant assets are investments in our subsidiaries 
this means that we are dependent on distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
more than of our revenues are derived from the operations of gswc 
moreover  none of our other subsidiaries has paid any dividends to us during the past three years 
as a result  we are largely dependent on cash flow from gswc to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt 
our subsidiaries only pay dividends if and when declared by the subsidiary board 
moreover  gswc is obligated to give first priority to its own capital requirements and to maintain a capital structure consistent with that determined to be reasonable by the cpuc in its most recent decision on capital structure  in order that ratepayers not be adversely affected by the holding company structure 
furthermore  our right to receive cash or other assets in the unlikely event of liquidation or reorganization of gswc is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
if we are unable to obtain funds from gswc in a timely manner  we may be unable to meet our financial obligations  make additional investments or pay dividends 
we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business  especially with respect to customer service and billing  accounting and  in some cases  the monitoring and operation of our treatment  storage and pumping facilities 
a loss of these systems or major problems with the operation of these systems could affect our operations and have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operations are geographically concentrated in california although we operate water and wastewater facilities in a number of states  our operations are concentrated in california  particularly southern california 
as a result  our financial results are largely subject to political  water supply  labor  utility cost and regulatory risks  economic conditions and other economic risks affecting california 
california has been particularly hard hit by the current economic crisis 
california is raising taxes in order to balance the state budget and jobs may be lost to other states which are perceived as having a more business friendly climate  thereby exacerbating the impact of the financial crisis in california 

table of contents we operate in areas subject to natural disasters or that may be the target of terrorist activities we operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes  fires  mudslides and other natural disasters 
while we maintain insurance policies to help reduce our financial exposure  a significant seismic event in southern california  where our operations are concentrated  or other natural disasters in california could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations 
the cpuc has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover these costs 
terrorists could seek to disrupt service to our customers by targeting our assets 
we have invested in additional security for facilities throughout our regulated service areas to mitigate the risks of terrorist activities 
we also may be prevented from providing water and or wastewater services at the military bases we serve in times of military crisis affecting these bases 
our electric business is subject to california law requiring procurement of renewable resources california law requires our electric division to procure renewable resources so that of our annual electricity sales are procured from renewable resources 
due to our relative size as compared to other energy utilities and the constrained renewable energy market  we have not been able to obtain sufficient resources to achieved interim target purchase levels of renewable energy resources 
the cpuc considered the future timing and applicability of renewable energy resource requirements as they apply to smaller energy utilities like our bves division and on may   the cpuc issued its final decision regarding the renewable responsibilities of small utilities including bves 
the final decision affirmed the renewable obligation targets for the small utilities but also allowed the small utilities to defer compliance under the cpuc s flexible compliance rules 
we will need to continue our efforts to procure renewable resources each year going forward  and where that may prove difficult because the market for such resources is very constrained  we will describe in detail the problems that warrant further deferral  in accordance with the cpuc s flexible compliance rules 
we believe that the cpuc s decision effectively forecloses any exposure to financial penalties for the year and earlier 
for the and years  we have not met the interim targets and expect that the cpuc will waive any potential fines in accordance with the flexible compliance rules 
it is unlikely that bves will have of its annual electricity sales procured from renewable resources for  however  we believe the cpuc will waive any potential fine in accordance with the flexible compliance rules

table of contents item legal proceedings water quality related litigation perchlorate and or volatile organic compounds voc have been detected in five wells servicing gswc s south san gabriel system 
gswc filed suit in federal court  along with two other affected water purveyors san gabriel valley water company and city of monterey park  and the san gabriel basin water quality authority wqa  against some of those allegedly responsible for the contamination of two of these wells 
the lawsuit was filed on august  in the united states district court for the central district of california 
some of the other potential defendants settled with gswc  other water purveyors and the wqa the water entities  on voc related issues prior to the filing of the lawsuit 
in response to the filing of the lawsuit  the potentially responsible party prp defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit or strike certain portions of the suit 
the judge issued a ruling on april  granting in part and denying in part the prp s motions 
a key ruling of the court was that the water purveyors  including gswc  by virtue of their ownership of wells contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
gswc has  pursuant to permission of the court  amended its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party under cercla 
registrant is presently unable to predict the outcome of this ruling on its ability to fully recover from the prps future costs associated with the treatment of these wells 
in this same suit  the prps have filed cross complaints against the water entities  the mwd  the main san gabriel basin watermaster and others on the theory that they arranged for and did transport contaminated water into the main san gabriel basin for use by gswc and the other two affected water purveyors and for other related claims 
on august   the us environmental protection agency epa issued unilateral administrative orders uao against parties deemed responsible for polluting the groundwater in that portion of the san gabriel valley from which these two impacted wells draw water 
gswc was not named as a party to the uao 
the uao requires that these parties remediate the contamination 
the judge in the lawsuit has appointed a special master to oversee mandatory settlement discussions between the prps and the water entities 
epa is also conducting settlement discussions with several prps regarding the uao

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets and where necessary  includes specific references to awr s individual segments and or other subsidiaries gswc  ccwc  asus and its subsidiaries 
included in the following analysis is a discussion of water and electric margins 
water and electric margins are computed by taking total revenues  less total supply costs 
registrant uses these margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results 
registrant believes this measure is a useful internal benchmark in evaluating the utility business performance within its water and electric segments 
registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to our operating budget as approved 
however  this measure  which is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income  which is determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of operating performance 
a reconciliation of water and electric margins to the most directly comparable gaap measures are included in the table on page overview registrant s revenues  operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses through approximately  miles of water distribution pipelines and the delivery of electricity in the big bear area of san bernardino county 
rates charged to customers of gswc and ccwc are determined by the cpuc and acc  respectively 
these rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital 
factors affecting financial performance of our regulated utilities include the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers  the ability to recover  and the process for recovering in rates the costs of distributing water and electricity and our overhead costs  weather  the impact of increased water quality standards and environmental regulations on the cost of operations and capital expenditures  water supply shortages caused by a variety of factors  capital expenditures needed to upgrade water systems  and risks associated with litigation relating to water quality and water supply  including suits initiated by registrant to protect its water supply 
operating revenues and income from contracted services at asus and its subsidiaries are earned from the operation  maintenance  renewal and replacement of water and or wastewater systems at various military bases 
all of these contracts with the us government are year firm  fixed price contracts with prospective price redeterminations 
asus also may generate revenues from the construction of infrastructure improvements at these bases pursuant to the terms of these year contracts or new infrastructure contracts pursuant to contract modifications 
additional revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on these additional construction activities 
as a result  asus is subject to risks that are different than those of registrant s regulated water and electric utilities 
asus plans to continue seeking contracts for the operation  maintenance  renewal and replacement of water and or wastewater services at military bases 
factors affecting the financial performance of our military utility privatization subsidiaries include delays in receiving payments from the us government and the timing of implementation by the us government of redeterminations and or equitable adjustments of prices under contracts with the us government 
registrant plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
capital expenditures in future years are expected to remain at much higher levels than depreciation expense 
when necessary  registrant obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings 
in may  awr completed a public offering of  shares of its common shares  including  shares issued upon exercise of an option granted to the underwriters to cover over allotments  at a price to the public of per share 
the net proceeds from the offering were million  after deductions for underwriting commissions and discounts  and direct legal and accounting fees 
the company used the proceeds of the offering to repay short term debt 
in addition  a senior note was issued by gswc on march   to cobank  acb cobank 
under the terms of this senior note  cobank purchased a senior note due march  in the aggregate principal amount of million from gswc 
the proceeds from the sale of the note to cobank have been used to pay down short term borrowings and to fund capital expenditures 
for  net income was million compared to million in  an increase of 
diluted earnings per share for were compared to in  an increase of per share 
factors that increased diluted earnings per share were the following items  all of which are more fully discussed below i an increase in the water and electric dollar water margin of million  or per share  during the year ended december  compared to the same period of  ii a settlement agreement reached with mirant energy trading  llc and the recording of million in proceeds  or per share  as a reduction in legal expenses  iii the improved financial performance of the military utility privatization subsidiaries resulting in an increase in asus s pretax operating income of million  or per share  iv a goodwill impairment charge in of million  or per share related to ccwc  with no similar charge 
table of contents in  and v a tax benefit of  recorded in the first quarter of resulting from new california apportionment laws as well as the refinement of certain related estimates  which favorably impacted earnings by per share 
these increases to diluted earnings per share were partially offset by i a million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts in  or per share  with no corresponding gain in  ii an increase in operating expenses  other than supply costs  at the company s water and electric utilities of million  or per share excluding the mirant energy trading settlement discussed above  iii the recording of a  loss on settlement for the removal of wells at ccwc  or per share  as a result of a decision issued by the acc in october  iv an increase in interest expense net of interest income of million  or per share  v an increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  negatively impacting earnings by per share  and vi a decrease of per share due to an increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding resulting from the issuance of million shares of awr s common shares in a public offering completed in may during  a charge of million  or per share  was recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill at ccwc in accordance with accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
during impairment testing in  registrant determined that revenue growth for its arizona utility  ccwc  was likely to be slower than originally projected due to downturns in overall economic conditions and new housing construction  as well as the current regulatory environment in arizona resulting in regulatory lags and lower than anticipated rate increases 
during the recent impairment testing in  it was determined that no further impairment of ccwc s goodwill had occurred 
at december   goodwill associated with the acquisition of ccwc was million 
the accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses on purchased power contracts that qualified as derivative instruments under the accounting guidance for derivatives changed between periods 
in may  the cpuc authorized gswc to establish a memorandum account to track unrealized gains and losses on a new contract  which the cpuc also approved  throughout the term of the contract 
at december  there was a million cumulative unrealized loss which has been included in the memorandum account 
as a result of cpuc approval of the memorandum account  this unrealized loss did not impact gswc s earnings 
gswc recognized unrealized gains and losses in earnings under its previous power purchase contracts 
there was a million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts included in earnings for diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  were per share 
eliminating the effects of the unrealized derivative gain  diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  would decrease by per share to per share 
subsequent events in march  onus filed a request for equitable adjustment rea following a joint inventory of the infrastructure at fort bragg in north carolina 
on the basis of this joint inventory  it was determined that the size of the onus infrastructure to be greater than what was assumed under the original year contract 
in january  the us government issued a contract modification approving the rea 
as a result of this contract modification  asus will record million of revenues and operating income approximately million of which is retroactive for the period from the commencement of the contract in march to december  during the first quarter of the us government is also expected to issue a further contract modification to continue the payment of this increased amount prospectively 
in march  fbws filed an rea as a claim with the us government  seeking an adjustment in the contract basis after it was determined that the infrastructure at fort bliss was substantially more than originally estimated by the us government as part of its solicitation for this contract 
in january  fbws and the us government entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the us government agreed to pay fbws retroactive operation and maintenance management fees and retroactive renewal and replacement fees from the contract commencement date  october  the payment of these funds is subject to availability of funding by the us government 
as such  no amounts will be recorded until an executed contract modification is received from the us government  which is expected during the second quarter of in addition  the settlement agreement provides that the first and second price redeterminations for fbws required by the contract be waived 
in january  the city of big bear and surrounding areas of san bernardino county experienced a series of snow storms  which damaged many bves power lines  poles  transformers  and other facilities and caused temporary interruption of service to many bves customers 
as a result of these storms  bves has incurred additional operating costs to repair equipment and restore electric service to its customers 
while service has been restored to bves customers  costs are still being incurred to repair equipment affected by the storms 
in february  gswc informed the cpuc it will track these costs in a catastrophic event memorandum account 
once all work resulting from these storms is completed  gswc intends to file an advice letter with the cpuc for recovery of these costs through a surcharge 
at this time  bves estimates that these 
table of contents costs will be approximately  this estimate includes bves labor  outside services assistance  equipment  materials  facilities damages and related snow removal services 
management believes that these incremental costs will be approved by the cpuc for recovery 
two former officers of gswc filed a lawsuit against both awr and gswc alleging among other things  wrongful termination and retaliation against the former officers 
on february   the parties agreed to mutually settle the matter and a settlement agreement was executed 
among other things  the settlement agreement releases registrant from claims of the former officers 
as a result of this matter  registrant recorded a pre tax charge of million during the fourth quarter of for legal and settlement costs 
this charge has been reflected in administrative and general expenses in the statement of income 
the october  decision in the general rate case for bves allows for an update to bves rates in for the corporate headquarters costs based on the cpuc s adoption of new rates for gswc s current regions ii and iii general rate case including the recovery of expenses associated with its corporate headquarters 
the general rate case for regions ii  iii and the general office has been delayed 
in addition  in june  the cpuc had authorized bves to track the difference between the adopted general office cost allocation to bves and the adopted general office cost allocation to bves  effective and retroactive from june  to october  the amount in this memorandum account totals approximately  as of december  however  the decision issued on october  did not address the disposition of this memorandum account 
in november  gswc filed a petition for modification to seek clarification from the cpuc on the treatment and recovery of this memorandum account 
in march  the cpuc approved for recovery this memorandum account through a surcharge over a month period 
accordingly  during the first quarter of  gswc will record a regulatory asset and a corresponding increase to earnings for amounts included in this memorandum account 
summary results by segment awr has three reportable segments water  electric and contracted services 
within the segments  awr has three principal business units water and electric service utility operations conducted through gswc  a water service utility operation conducted through ccwc  and contracted services conducted through asus and its subsidiaries 
the tables below set forth summaries of the results by segment in thousands for the years ended december  and operating revenues pretax operating income year year year year ended ended ended ended change change change change water electric contracted services awr parent totals from operation water for the year ended december   pretax operating income for water increased by million  or  primarily due to a million increase in the water dollar margin as compared to  and the goodwill impairment charge of million  or per share  recorded in at ccwc in accordance with accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets as more fully described below 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of million  including higher pension costs 
the dollar water margin increased due to higher water rates approved by the cpuc subsequent to december  these higher water rates increased water revenues by million  partially offset by lower actual consumption 
in addition  as a result of a full year of applying the water revenue adjustment mechanism wram in regions ii and iii and implementation of the wram in region i s ratemaking areas in september  gswc recorded million of additional revenues in as compared to million for the revenue requirement and volumetric revenues are adopted as part of a general rate case grc every three years 
a grc was filed for region i in january  with rates effective january and gswc expects to file a grc for all three water regions in july of with rates effective january as part of future grcs  the cpuc is expected to adopt new volumetric revenues based on historical usage patterns and the revenue requirement adopted in these grcs 
although the recording of the wram added million of water revenues in  this favorable impact to earnings was reduced by million of water supply over collection costs tracked in the modified cost balancing account mcba 
the mcba was also in place for all of for regions ii and iii and beginning in september for region i s ratemaking areas 
the over collection in the mcba account is due to i lower consumption in as compared to the consumption level adopted by the cpuc  and ii a lower percentage of purchased water in the supply mix during when compared to the supply mix included in customer rates  partially offset by increases in rates charged by gswc s suppliers 
the total increase in the wram  net of the mcba  was million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the implementation of the wram and mcba help mitigate fluctuations in gswc s earnings caused by changes in the volume of water sold and supply costs 
in addition  gswc recorded million of additional water revenues included in the water conservation memorandum account wcma for all of its water regions in the cpuc approved an advice letter filing in a separate proceeding to allow gswc to create and implement a wcma to track the extraordinary expenses and revenue shortfall associated with conservation measures in conjunction with the declared drought in california 
the wcma was effective august  and was used to track the revenue shortfall until the wram was implemented for regions ii and iii on november  and for region i s rate making areas on september  at november   approximately million of net under collections was included in the wcma for regions ii and iii prior to the 
table of contents implementation of the wram 
on april   the cpuc approved the advice letter filed by gswc to recover the million included in the wcma for regions ii and iii and authorized gswc to establish a month surcharge to customers bills 
the surcharge went into effect on april  accordingly  gswc established a million regulatory asset  which was recorded as additional water revenues during the second quarter of in addition  gswc has established a million regulatory asset for region i s wcma balance incurred during the period of august  through august  which is also now probable of recovery 
in october  gswc filed an advice letter for recovery of region i s wcma  through a month surcharge  for amounts incurred during this period 
electric for the year ended december   pretax operating income from electric operations decreased by million due in large part to a million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts included in earnings for the year ended december  with no corresponding gain in as previously mentioned  the purchased power contracts that impacted gswc s earnings expired on december  gswc began taking delivery of power under a new contract effective january  unrealized gains and losses on this contract do not impact earnings 
there was also an increase in operating expenses  including higher pension costs and higher outside consulting and legal costs related to the general rate case and the new purchased power contract 
however  these increases in operating costs were partially offset by the recording of million in proceeds received in a settlement agreement with mirant energy trading  llc in may  which reduced previously incurred legal costs 
in october  the cpuc approved bves s general rate case 
the cpuc authorized bves to establish and implement a base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism brram 
the bbram decouples customer usage from revenue  which should help mitigate fluctuations in the revenues and earnings of the electric business due to changes in the amount of electricity used by our electric customers 
in accordance with the cpuc s decision  gswc implemented tiered rates in its bves service area on november  and began recording the difference between what is billed to customers and that which is authorized by the cpuc 
for the year ended december   an additional  in electric revenues was recorded in the brram account 
contracted services for the year ended december   pretax operating income for contracted services increased by million  or per share 
this was primarily due to an increase in construction revenues at fbws and odus  an interim increase in operations and maintenance revenues at fbws  improved performance at psus and onus  and lower overall operating expenses 
in addition  on september   the us government approved million in revenues for an rea filed by psus for emergency construction costs mostly incurred in as a result of the approved rea  asus recorded million in additional construction revenues and operating income for the timely receipt of price redeterminations continues to be critical in order for asus to recover increasing costs for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems at the military bases 
in addition  higher expenses from the general office and asus headquarters allocated to the military utility privatization subsidiaries were not contemplated at the time the contracts with the us government were negotiated and may be addressed in future price redeterminations 
under the terms of these contracts  the contract price is subject to price redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter 
redeterminations have been submitted and are under review by the us government for operations of odus and tus in virginia and maryland  respectively 
the price redeterminations for odus is expected to be completed in pending redetermination of prices  odus has received interim inflation adjustments to the management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems for military bases in virginia  and the wastewater system at fort lee  also in virginia  effective on the second anniversary of the date when asus began operating these bases february  for fort lee and april  for the other three bases 
asus is in discussions with the us government regarding the status of the redetermination filing for tus as well as an interim inflation adjustment to the management fees under that contract 
management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these discussions with the us government or the timing of the finalization of the price redetermination at tus 
the first price redeterminations for psus and onus are expected to be filed during the first quarter of management fees for operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at fort bliss are based on cost levels prevailing in when the contract with the us government was bid 
further  the contract pricing was also based on assumptions about the size and age of the infrastructure to be operated and maintained over the year contract 
in december  the us government approved an interim adjustment for fbws which increased the monthly water and wastewater fees by and  respectively  related to operating and maintaining the fort bliss systems 
the increase was retroactive to october  as previously discussed  in january  fbws and the us government entered into a settlement agreement regarding the size and age of the fort bliss infrastructure 

table of contents these price redeterminations and equitable adjustments  which include adjustments to reflect changes in operating conditions and infrastructure levels from that assumed at the time of the execution of the contracts  are expected to provide added revenues prospectively to help offset increased costs and provide registrant the opportunity to continue or generate positive operating income at its military utility privatization subsidiaries 
as of december   asus has million of goodwill  which may be at risk for potential impairment if requested price redeterminations and equitable adjustments that have not yet been approved  are not received 
in september  the us government issued contract modifications to subsidiaries of asus 
the modifications provided funding for million in new construction projects at fbws  odus  tus and onus 
the majority of this work will be performed during calendar year earnings and cash flows from amendments and modifications to the original year contracts with the us government for additional construction projects may or may not continue in future periods 
the following discussion and analysis for the years ended december   and provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets and where necessary  includes specific references to awr s individual segments and or other subsidiaries gswc  ccwc  and asus and its subsidiaries

as previously mentioned  these purchased power contracts that impacted gswc s earnings expired on december  gswc began taking delivery of power under a new contract effective january  unrealized gains and losses on this contract do not impact earnings 
a goodwill impairment charge of million  or per share  during the year ended december  related to ccwc 
there was no similar impairment charge in 
table of contents an increase in the water and electric margin of million  or per share  during the year ended december  compared to the same period of due primarily to i higher water rates approved by the cpuc effective january   ii the water margin impact from an increase in the wram  net of the mcba of approximately million as compared to the same period of  and iii the recording of million of additional revenues due to the cpuc s approval in april of the water conservation memorandum accounts wcma 
these increases were partially offset by lower water consumption of approximately when compared to the same period in a settlement agreement between gswc and mirant energy trading  llc  which resulted in the recording of million  or per share  as a reduction to legal costs during the second quarter of there was no similar gain in an increase of million  or per share in operating expenses  other than supply costs and excluding the mirant settlement discussed above  at the company s water and electric utility businesses for the year ended december  this was due to an increase in pension expenses  labor and other related benefits  an increase in outside services costs  maintenance expense  and higher depreciation and amortization expense 
in addition  on february  a settlement was reached between registrant and two former officers 
as a result of the settlement  a pre tax charge of million for legal and settlement costs was recorded to administrative and general expenses in the fourth quarter of an increase in pretax operating income for contracted services of million  or per share  during the year ended december  due primarily to i an increase in special construction projects at fbws and odus  ii improved performance at psus and onus as compared to the prior year  and iii an additional million in construction revenues recorded at psus in the third quarter of as a result of the approval by the us government of a request for an equitable adjustment relating to previously incurred emergency construction costs 
the recording of a loss by ccwc on the settlement for removal of wells of  or per share  as a result of a decision issued by the acc on october  an increase in interest expense net of interest income of million  or per share  due primarily to i an increase in long term debt from the issuance of million of notes in march  ii gswc s recording of  interest income  during the second quarter of in connection with revisions to awr s income tax return  with no similar gain in  iii the recording of  of interest expense in the interest rate balancing account approved by the cpuc in july in the cost of capital proceeding  and iv lower interest income in of  accrued in the aerojet litigation memorandum account balance 
a decrease of per share due to an increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding resulting from the issuance of million shares of awr s common shares in a public offering completed in may an increase in the effective tax rate etr during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in negatively impacted earnings by per share due primarily to changes between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
this increase in the etr was partially offset by a tax benefit of  recorded in the first quarter of resulting from new california apportionment laws as well as the refinement of certain related estimates 
this increase favorably impacted earnings by per share 
operating revenues water for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  contributing to this increase were rate increases approved by the cpuc effective january   which added approximately million to water revenues in in addition  as a result of the implementation of the wram accounts for regions ii and iii in late november of and in region i s ratemaking areas in september  gswc recorded an increase of million of additional revenues for the year ended as compared to the same period in furthermore  gswc recorded a total of million in the wcma accounts for gswc s water regions 
there also was an increase in water revenues of million due to surcharges approved by the cpuc in effect to recover under collections in supply costs 
these increases were primarily offset by approximately 
table of contents million resulting from a decrease in actual consumption of approximately when compared to the year ended december  although precipitation was overall lower in compared to the same period in  water consumption was down due to the continued effects of state wide customer conservation efforts 
in addition  included approximately  of additional revenues approved by the cpuc  which did not recur in gswc s revenue requirement and volumetric revenues will be adopted as part of a grc every three years 
gswc filed its region i grc in january for new rates in and gswc will file a grc for all three water regions in july of with rates effective january as part of future grcs  the cpuc is expected to adopt new volumetric revenues based on historical usage patterns and the revenue requirement adopted in these grcs 
electric for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to rate increases approved by the cpuc and the implementation of the base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism  in november contracted services revenues from contracted services are comprised of construction revenues including renewals and replacements and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and or wastewater systems at military bases 
for the year ended december   revenues from contracted services increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher construction revenues 
construction revenues increased by million primarily related to new construction projects at fbws and odus  which increased construction revenues by million and million  respectively 
construction revenues for the year ended december  at psus and onus increased million  including the government approved request for equitable adjustment of million recorded in for psus as previously discussed 
increased construction revenues at these four bases were partially offset by lower construction revenues of million at tus 
earnings and cash flows from new construction projects may or may not continue in future periods 
for the year ended december   management fees for operating and maintaining the various systems totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  in december  the us government authorized an interim adjustment at fbws retroactive to october  which increased the monthly water and wastewater fees by and  respectively  pending resolution of fbws s request for an equitable adjustment due to higher inventory at fbws than described in the request for proposal 
this resulted in an increase of approximately  to fbws management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of an additional  in revenue was generated from management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems under the contracts for fort jackson and fort bragg which commenced during the first quarter of  as a result of a full year of operations in these increases were partially offset by million in one time transition revenues for the start up of operations for fort jackson and fort bragg in registrant relies upon rate approvals by state regulatory agencies in california and arizona to provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant  and price redeterminations and equitable adjustments by the us government in order to recover operating expenses and profit margin 
if adequate rate relief and price redeterminations and adjustments are not granted in a timely manner  operating revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
operating expenses supply costs supply costs for the water segment consist of purchased water  purchased power for pumping  groundwater production assessments and water supply cost balancing accounts 
supply costs for the electric segment consist of purchased power for resale including the cost of natural gas and the electric supply cost balancing account 
water and electric margins are computed by taking total revenues  less total supply costs 
registrant uses these margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results 
registrant believes this measure is a useful internal benchmark in evaluating the utility business performance within its water and electric segments 
registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to our operating budget as approved 
however  this measure  which is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income  which is determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of operating performance 
total supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses 
supply costs accounted for approximately and of total operating expenses for the year ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents the table below provides the amount of increases decreases  percent changes in supply costs  and margins during the year ended december  and amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water operating revenues water supply costs water purchased power purchased for pumping groundwater production assessment water supply cost balancing accounts total water supply costs water margin percent margin water electric operating revenues electric supply costs power purchased for resale electric supply cost balancing accounts total electric supply costs electric margin percent margin electric as reported on awr s consolidated statements of income  except for supply cost balancing accounts 
the sum of water and electric supply cost balancing accounts in the table above is shown on awr s consolidated statements of income and totaled  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
water and electric margins do not include any depreciation and amortization  maintenance expense  unrealized gains and losses on purchased power contracts  or other operating expenses 
two of the principal factors affecting water supply costs and gross margin are the amount of water produced and the source of the water 
generally  the variable cost of producing water from wells is less than the cost of water purchased from wholesale suppliers 
in addition  gswc is authorized to establish water and electric supply cost balancing accounts for increases and or decreases in costs due to changes in rates charged by its suppliers which provide purchased water and purchased power  and by agencies assessing groundwater related pump taxes for water service areas in california 
higher or lower actual costs as compared to costs authorized by the cpuc will either be recovered from or refunded to customers in the future 
prior to november  changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s wells would increase decrease actual supply related costs relative to the mix approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
on august   the cpuc issued a final decision which approved the establishment of a modified cost balancing account or mcba that allows recovery of supply costs for changes in water supply mix 
gswc implemented the mcba in late november for regions ii and iii and in september for region i s rate making areas prospectively in connection with the new conservation rate design and the implementation of a wram 
under the mcba  gswc began tracking adopted expense levels for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes  as established by the cpuc 
variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume between adopted and actual purchased water  purchased power  and pump tax expenses are recorded as a component of the supply cost balancing account provision 
the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to gswc s customers at a later date 
this is reflected with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for each water ratemaking area 

table of contents for the year ended december   of the company s water supply mix was purchased as compared to purchased for the year ended december  however  as noted previously  gswc implemented the mcba which eliminates the effects on earnings of changes in the water supply mix prospectively 
the adopted percentages of purchased water for the year ended december  at regions i  ii and iii were  and  respectively  as compared to actual purchased water of  and  respectively  for region i s supply mix consists primarily of pumped water 
the variance in regions ii s actual mix compared to the mix approved by the cpuc resulted in an over collection in the mcba account 
this caused an overall decrease in the water margin percentage to for compared to in since gswc no longer receives any benefit from a more favorable supply mix than that approved by the cpuc 
purchased water costs for the year ended december  decreased by to million as compared to million in the decrease in purchased water costs was due to lower customer usage  partially offset by higher water rates charged from wholesale suppliers 
for the year ended december   power purchased for pumping decreased to million  compared to million for this was due to lower customer demand  partially offset by increases in supplier rates 
there were also changes in the actual supply mix  as discussed above 
groundwater production assessments were higher by due primarily to increases in assessment rates pump tax rates levied against groundwater production  effective july in particular  region ii s average pump tax rates increased by approximately or million between the two periods 
these increases in groundwater production assessments were partially offset by lower customer demand 
the mcba tracks the increases in pump tax rates for future recovery in water rates 
an increase of million in the water supply cost balancing account provision during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily caused by i a million increase in the amortization of the water supply cost balancing accounts for surcharges currently in effect  ii the recording of million in the mcba accounts  iii a net decrease of million of under collections in only related to region i prior to its implementation of the mcba on september  compared to  and iv the recording of a  net under collection adjustment relating to region iii s pre supply costs which were approved by the cpuc in may of upon approval by the cpuc  a regulatory asset was established for these previously incurred supply costs 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bves division decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting lower customer demand 
in addition  gswc began receiving power under a new purchased power contract on january  the main product under the new contract provides for mws of electric energy at a fixed price of per mwh during as compared to during the decrease in the price of purchased power is reflected in the electric supply cost balancing account resulting in no change to the dollar margin for electric services 
unrealized gain on purchased power contracts pursuant to the accounting guidance for derivatives  the unrealized gain on purchased power contracts during represented gains recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements 
there was a million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  these contracts terminated on december  and gswc began taking delivery under a new purchased power contract in january in may  the cpuc issued a final decision approving the contract and authorizing a memorandum account to track unrealized gains and losses 
accordingly  a cumulative unrealized loss of million as of december  has been included in the memorandum account 
this unrealized loss did not impact earnings 
other operation expenses the primary components of other operation expenses include payroll  materials and supplies  chemicals and water treatment  and outside service costs of operating the regulated water systems  including the costs associated with water transmission and distribution  pumping  water quality  meter reading  billing  and operations of district offices 
registrant s electric and contracted services operations incur many of the same types of costs as well 
for the year ended december  and  other operation expenses by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands 
table of contents year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total other operation expenses for the year ended december   other operation expenses for water and electric services increased by  or  primarily due to higher operation labor and related benefits of  and an increase of  in other operation expenses 
contracted services experienced decreases in other operation expenses of million primarily due to transition costs some of which exceeded non recurring transition revenues recovered pursuant to the terms of contracts executed by asus of million incurred during the year ended december  as a result of the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at fort jackson and fort bragg 
there was also a decrease of approximately  in outside services costs partly attributable to payments to a subcontractor that provided wastewater services to certain of asus subsidiaries in on january   asus and its subsidiaries agreed to buy out all current and future rights which this subcontractor had to provide wastewater services at any bases operated by asus and any of its present and or future subsidiaries 
for the year ended december   many of these services were performed internally  some of which are recorded in labor costs within maintenance expense 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of  relating to operation labor and benefits  and an increase of  in other miscellaneous operation expenses 
administrative and general expenses administrative and general expenses include payroll related to administrative and general functions  the related employee benefits charged to expense accounts  insurance expenses  outside legal and consulting fees  regulatory utility commission expenses  expenses associated with being a public company  and general corporate expenses 
for the year ended december  and  administrative and general expenses by segment  including awr parent  consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services awr parent total administrative and general expenses for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by million in water services compared to the year ended december  due primarily to i an increase of million in pension expenses resulting from a reduction in the fair value of plan assets in caused by market conditions at the time  ii a settlement agreement reached with two former officers of gswc which resulted in a charge of million during the fourth quarter of for legal and settlement costs  and iii an increase of  in labor and other employee benefits 
these increases were partially offset by  of additional compensation expense incurred in relating to an agreement executed by the company with respect to the resignation of a gswc officer effective september  this expense did not recur in there was also a decrease in travel costs of  and a decrease of  in other miscellaneous administrative 
table of contents and general expenses 
for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by  in electric services compared to the year ended december  due primarily to i a  increase in labor costs and pension costs  ii a  increase in outside consulting  legal and other services resulting from the current general rate case and the new purchased power contract  iii an increase in general rate case costs of  not being recovered in customer rates related to bves s rate case  iv an increase of  in allocation of costs from the corporate headquarters to bves  and v an increase of  in other administrative expenses 
these increases were partially offset by the recording of million as a reduction to previously incurred legal costs in connection with a settlement agreement reached with mirant energy trading  llc  as previously discussed 
there was an increase of  in administrative and general expenses for contracted services due primarily to an increase of million in labor costs and related employee benefits 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in legal and consulting services of  resulting from reduced need for such services relating to filings with the us government and costs incurred in related to the liquidated damages claim at fbws  which was settled in february there was also a decrease of  in other miscellaneous expenses 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  and  depreciation and amortization by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense for water and electric services increased by million to million compared to million for year ended december  reflecting  among other things  million of additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to ongoing construction at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
there was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense for contracted services due primarily to the addition of fixed assets associated with taking over the assets of asus former subcontractor for wastewater services at fbws  odus  and tus and the purchase of wastewater cleaning vehicles at four of asus military base operations 
maintenance for the year ended december  and  maintenance expense by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands 
table of contents year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total maintenance for the year ended december   maintenance expense for water services increased by  to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to maintenance on gswc s wells  water supply and distribution facilities at regions ii and iii 
gswc s maintenance expense at its three water regions increased by  during compared to in addition  there was an increase of  in maintenance costs at ccwc 
there was an increase of  in maintenance expenses for electric services related to the mw natural gas fueled generation plant 
an increase of  in contracted services maintenance expense was due primarily to increased maintenance costs of  at fbws and odus  resulting from higher internal labor costs associated with wastewater services performed by employees that were provided by a subcontractor prior to february these increases were partially offset by decreased maintenance costs at psus  which incurred higher emergency maintenance costs in as a result of the age and condition of the infrastructure upon commencement of operations at fort jackson in south carolina 
these costs were a portion of the rea for psus previously discussed and for which some recovery has been received from the us government 
further recovery of such costs is pending a final determination by the us government 
property and other taxes for the year ended december  and  property and other taxes by segment  consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total property and other taxes for the year ended december   property and other taxes for water and electric services increased by  due to higher payroll taxes and franchise fees  partially offset by lower property taxes as a result of a tax refund of  due to lower reassessed property values 
property and other taxes were higher in contracted services due to an increase in payroll taxes resulting from an increase in the number of employees 
asus construction expenses for the year ended december   asus s construction expenses were million  increasing million compared to the same period in due primarily to new construction projects at fbws and odus  which had increases of million and million  respectively  as compared to these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in construction expense at tus and a  decrease at psus 
for the year ended december   psus 
table of contents incurred expenses of  in emergency construction and  in anticipated losses associated with certain construction projects at fort jackson 
in  such emergency costs were lower and additional anticipated losses were not incurred 
construction costs at onus increased by million as compared to the same period in goodwill impairment charge during  a charge of million was recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill in accordance with accounting guidance related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by this accounting guidance  registrant tests goodwill annually for impairment at the reporting unit level  or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable 
registrant evaluates goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for reporting units with goodwill balances 
the realization of goodwill is dependent on expected future cash flows from the underlying operations 
forecasted revenues and capital expenditures  which include forecasted customer connection growth and the timing and amount of regulated rate increases  are key components of the discounted cash flow projections 
during the impairment analysis  registrant determined that revenue growth for its arizona utility  ccwc  was likely to be slower than originally projected due to downturns in overall economic conditions and lower than anticipated rate increases 
based on this goodwill impairment analysis  million of goodwill associated with ccwc was found to be impaired and was charged to expense during the fourth quarter of the current impairment analysis performed for did not indicate impairment for the current amount of million in goodwill for ccwc or the million in goodwill for asus 
loss on settlement for removal of wells in  in an agreement with the fountain hills sanitary district fhsd  ccwc agreed to permanently cease using one of its wells in order for the fhsd to secure an aquifer protection permit for its recharge system 
based on previous decisions ruled by the acc on similar gains  ccwc recognized a net gain of  of the proceeds in related to the settlement agreement and established a regulatory liability for the remaining  pending the acc s review of this matter 
on october   the acc ordered ccwc to treat the entire settlement proceeds of  as a reduction to rate base 
as a result  ccwc recognized a loss of  during the third quarter of this effectively reverses the original gain recorded in in november  ccwc filed an application for rehearing on several issues including the sharing of this gain from the settlement proceeds 
the acc granted ccwc s request to hold a rehearing on the issues 
on january   a procedural conference was held with the judge and the staff of the acc involved in the rate case to address a schedule for the rehearing 
the rehearing is now scheduled for april  net gain on sale of property for the year ended december   registrant recorded a pre tax gain of  on the sale of property in the water services segment 
there was no similar gain in the same period of interest expense for the year ended december  and  interest expense by segment  including awr parent consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water and electric services contracted services awr parent total interest expense overall  interest expense increased in reflecting an increase in long term debt  partially offset by lower interest rates and lower short term borrowings 
on march   gswc issued a senior note in the amount of million to cobank due march  with an interest rate of 
in addition  a decision issued in july in the gswc cost of 
table of contents capital proceeding authorized an interest rate balancing account to track interest costs of new debt 
this balancing account tracks any difference between the incremental cost of debt included in the cost of capital decision and the actual cost of debt for any long term debt issued by gswc from the effective date of the final decision 
this difference totaled  for the year ended december  and was included in the balancing account  increasing interest expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in short term cash borrowings 
average bank loan balances outstanding under the awr credit facility for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to an average of million during the same period of the average interest rate on short term borrowings for the year ended december  was as compared to an average of during interest income for the year ended december  and  interest income by segment  including awr parent consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water and electric services contracted services awr parent total interest income interest income decreased by approximately  for the year ended december  due to the recording in of  in interest income in connection with the irs s examination of the income tax return  with no similar income in in addition  lower interest rates for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of resulted in a decrease in interest income  including a decrease of  in interest accrued on the uncollected balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account authorized by the cpuc 
other for the year ended december  and  registrant recorded other income of  and  respectively  as a result of registrant s equity interest in an investment

in addition  the effective tax rate etr for water and electric services for the year ended december  increased to approximately as compared to a etr applicable for the year ended december  the etr deviates from the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and changes between book and taxable 
table of contents income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements principally plant  rate case and compensation related items 
flow through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period  with an offsetting increase or decrease occurring in another period 
income tax expense for contracted services increased to million compared to a tax benefit of  for the year ended december  due primarily to an increase in pretax income 
the etr for contracted services for the year ended december  was as compared to a etr applicable to the year ended december  awr parent receives a tax benefit for expenses incurred at the parent company level 
for the year ended december   the taxes recorded at awr parent also include the effect of a change in california law during the first quarter of on february   california s governor signed two bills into law that amended and added several new provisions to california s revenue and taxation code 
one of the provisions in these bills changed the manner by which most taxpayers may compute the portion of their income derived from multiple jurisdictions that is subject to california taxation 
during the first quarter of  awr applied the change in tax law resulting from enactment of the bills based on its understanding of the legislature s intent  which is to permit taxpayers to apply an alternative apportionment method commencing with the tax year 
on october   california s governor signed a bill into law that conformed the new provision s language to the legislature s intent  consistent with awr s understanding of that intent 
as a result of management s intention to apply the alternative method  awr adjusted its deferred tax balances in the first quarter of to reflect the expected amount at which it will realize its california deferred taxes consistent with the change in tax law  and refined certain related estimates 
this resulted in the recording of a benefit of approximately  or per share  during the first quarter of  without a material change through the end of while the effect of the tax law change will continue to affect awr s state taxes  the future effects may be beneficial or detrimental depending on a combination of the profitability of awr s non california activities as well as the relative proportion of the factor s applied by its apportionment method 
periodically  management will assess its intention to apply the alternative method and will adjust its deferred tax balances accordingly

an unrealized gain on purchased power contracts which increased pretax income during the year ended december  by million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  for the same period in  a net decrease of per share 
increased water rates partially offset by higher water supply costs contributed per share to earnings while an approximate decrease in water usage during the year ended december  resulted in a million decrease in water revenues  or per share 
the water revenues appear to have been impacted by the effects of state wide customer conservation efforts 
with the implementation of the wram and mcba for 
table of contents regions ii and iii in late november  earnings were favorably impacted by approximately per share in the fourth quarter of that would have previously been lost due to conservation 
therefore  the net impact due to lower sales in was per share 
as a result of these individual factors  the overall dollar water margin increased by million  or per share  during the year ended december  pretax operating income for contracted services declined by million  or per share  during the year ended december  due primarily to losses incurred at fort bragg in north carolina and fort jackson in south carolina 
asus commenced operation of water and wastewater systems at these military bases during the first quarter of and incurred higher than anticipated transition  maintenance and emergency construction costs as well as projected losses on certain construction contracts 
current estimates of construction costs compared to contract revenues indicate losses on certain initial capital upgrade projects 
modifications or change orders had not yet been approved by the us government  and therefore  the anticipated losses on these projects and pre contract costs were recorded in construction expenses during as discussed previously  on september   the us government approved an rea filed by psus in for million in revenues and operating income  which addresses a portion of these pre contract costs 
the remaining amounts are currently being negotiated with the us government 
registrant recorded a net gain on sale of property of  or per share  during the year ended december  there was no similar gain in the same period of gswc recorded  in interest income  or per share  during the second quarter of in connection with the irs s examination of the income tax return 
a significant decrease in the effective income tax rate during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in favorably impacted earnings by per share during these decreases were due primarily to changes between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
higher other expenses at gswc in primarily consisting of administrative  general  depreciation and other operating expenses as described below  contributed to an overall decrease of per diluted share to the results of operations 
operating revenues water for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily contributing to this increase were the following i rate increases in all three gswc water regions approved by the cpuc effective january   which added approximately million to water revenues during the year ended december   ii an increase in water revenues of million due to the surcharge approved by the cpuc effective in may to recover region iii s under collection in supply costs  this increase in revenues was offset by a corresponding amount in the supply cost balancing accounts discussed below  resulting in no impact to pretax operating income  iii the adoption of the wram effective november  at which time gswc began recording the difference between what is billed to its metered customers in regions ii and iii and that which is authorized by the cpuc  gswc recorded million of additional revenues caused by the under collection in the wram accounts during the month of december  and iv the recording of  in july of additional revenues in connection with corrections to the rate calculation for region iii 
these increases in water revenues were partially offset by a decrease of approximately in water consumption due to conservation during  which caused water revenues to be lower by approximately million 
the implementation of the wram should help mitigate fluctuations in registrant s future revenues due to changes in water consumption 
the decline in the number of customers did not result in a significant decrease in water revenues 
electric for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to a decrease of in electric usage and lower connection and reconnection fees 
the effects of lower electric usage were partially offset by an adjustment of  in december resulting from bves low income program balancing account which reduced electric revenues during there was no similar adjustment made during 
table of contents contracted services revenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and or wastewater systems at military bases 
for the year ended december   revenues from contracted services increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  approximately million in new revenue was generated from management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems at fort bragg in north carolina and fort jackson in south carolina  both of which began during the first quarter of there was also approximately million in construction and transition revenues at these two bases 
at the other bases under existing contracts in and  there was an increase of  in management fees due primarily to interim increases at fbws and odus 
this was offset by a net decrease of million in construction revenues at these existing bases during when compared to in  a wastewater expansion project at fort bliss generated million of construction revenues out of a total of million for all asus subsidiaries during the year ended december  the project was completed in august and did not recur in although there was no similar singularly significant project during  asus subsidiaries did undertake similar construction activities in that were on a smaller scale and collectively helped replace construction revenues generated from the wastewater expansion project in earnings and cash flows from amendments and modifications to the original year contracts with the us government for construction projects may or may not continue in future periods

prior to november  changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s wells would increase decrease actual supply related costs relative to the mix approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
on august   the cpuc issued a final decision which approved the establishment of a modified cost balancing account that allows recovery of supply costs for changes in water supply mix 
gswc implemented the mcba in november prospectively in connection with the new conservation rate design and the implementation of a wram to decouple sales from revenues 
under the mcba  gswc began tracking adopted expense levels for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes  as established by the cpuc 
variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume between adopted and actual purchased water  purchased power  and pump tax expenses are recorded as a component of the supply cost balancing account provision  as the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to gswc s customers at a later date 
this is reflected with an offsetting entry to a current asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for regions ii and iii 
for the year ended december   of gswc s water supply mix was purchased as compared to purchased for the year ended december  because the cost of water purchased is generally higher than pumped water from gswc s wells  this change in mix resulted in a slight improvement in water s percent margin prior to november compared to the same period in as noted above  in november gswc implemented the mcba for regions ii and iii which eliminates the effects of changes in the water supply mix prospectively 
purchased water costs for the year ended december  increased by to million as compared to million in the increase in purchased water due to higher water rates charged from wholesale suppliers was offset by lower customer usage and the slight favorable change in the supply mix discussed above 
in general  the supply cost balancing account as discussed above allows gswc to track incremental rate changes from suppliers for future recovery in water rates 
the favorable change in the supply mix allowed gswc to serve a portion of the customer demand from groundwater production rather than wholesale purchases  primarily because of the return to service or replacement of wells which had been removed from service in as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems 
for the year ended december   the decrease of in power purchased for pumping was principally due to lower customer demand  partially offset by a favorable change in the supply mix  as discussed above 
groundwater production assessments were higher by due to a favorable change in supply mix and increases in assessment rates pump tax rates levied against groundwater production  effective july and average pump tax rates increased in regions ii and iii by approximately and  respectively  between the two periods 
these increases in groundwater production assessments were partially offset by lower customer demand 
the supply cost balancing account and mcba tracks the increases in pump tax rates for future recovery in water rates 
the supply cost balancing account tracks differences between the current cost for supply items water  power  and pump taxes charged by gswc s suppliers and the cost for those items incorporated into gswc s rates 
over collections occur when the current cost of these items is less than the amount in rates which has the effect of increasing the supply cost balancing account in the statements of income 
under collections occur when the current cost exceeds the amount in rates for these items and  conversely  will have the effect of decreasing the supply cost balancing account in the statements of income 
typically  over collections or under collections  when they occur  are tracked in the supply cost balancing accounts for future refund or recovery through a surcredit in the event of an over collection or surcharge in the event of an under collection on customers bills 
once in rates  the amortization of surcharges that are in place to recover under collections from customers have the effect of increasing the supply cost balancing account and increasing revenues in the statements of income  resulting in no earnings impact 
conversely  the amortization of surcredits that are in rates to refund over collections to customers have the effect of decreasing the supply cost balancing account and decreasing revenues  also resulting in no earnings impact 
an increase of  in the water supply cost balancing account provision during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily caused by i a million increase in the amortization of the water supply cost balancing accounts for surcharges currently in effect  ii the recording of  in the mcba accounts effective november   and iii a  decrease in interest earned on the supply cost balancing accounts due to lower interest rates  offset by i a net increase totaling million of under collections in compared to the same period in  and ii the recording of a  net under collection adjustment relating to region iii s pre supply costs which were approved by the cpuc in may of  upon approval by the cpuc  a regulatory asset was established for these previously incurred supply costs 

table of contents for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bves division decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting primarily lower customer demand and kilowatt hour usage 
overall  electric s dollar margin decreased by  due to lower demand and a  decrease in interest earned on the electric supply cost balancing account due to lower interest rates  partially offset by an adjustment of  in resulting from bves low income program which reduced electric revenues 
unrealized gain loss on purchased power contracts unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represent gains and losses recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements 
there was a million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the contract requiring the recording of unrealized gains and losses on the income statement at bves terminated at december  gswc began taking delivery under a new purchased power contract in january in may  the cpuc issued a final decision approving the contract and authorizing a memorandum account to track unrealized gains and losses 
as a result  unrealized gains and losses on the new power contract do not impact earnings

there was an increase of  in other operation expenses for electric services primarily due to higher wages and related benefits of  an increase of  in bad debt expense and an increase of  in other expenses 
contracted services experienced increases in other operation expenses of  primarily due to the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at fort bragg in north carolina and fort jackson in south carolina that began during the first quarter of as a result of these new bases  other operating expenses increased by million during the year ended december   including million in transition costs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases at the other military bases during resulting from lower outside services costs of million primarily paid to the subcontractor that provided wastewater services to certain of asus subsidiaries 
on january   asus and its subsidiaries agreed to buy out all current and future rights which this subcontractor had to provide wastewater services at any bases operated by asus and any of its present and or future subsidiaries 
for the year ended december   most of these services were performed internally at lower cost  some of which is recorded in labor costs within maintenance expense 
there was also a decrease of  in bad debt expense due to the reversal of previously recorded reserves resulting from collections of past due receivables from the us government  partially offset by an increase of  in other expenses

there was an increase of million in contracted services maintenance expense due primarily to the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at fort bragg in north carolina and fort jackson in south carolina that began during the first quarter of  which added million in maintenance expense for the year ended december  the level of maintenance costs reflects the age and condition of the infrastructure at these bases 
there was also increased maintenance expense of  at the other bases due primarily to higher internal labor costs as a result of the military utility privatization subsidiaries performing services directly that were formerly performed by a wastewater subcontractor 
as previously mentioned  in january  asus and its subsidiaries agreed to buy out all current and future rights which this subcontractor had to provide wastewater services at any bases operated by asus

construction expenses for the year ended december   asus construction expenses increased to million compared to million for the same period in the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at fort bragg in north carolina and fort jackson in south carolina that began during the first quarter of added construction expenses of million during the year ended december   including  for emergency construction at psus to address pre existing conditions not anticipated in the contract and  in anticipated losses associated with certain initial capital upgrade projects 
as discussed previously  on september   the us government approved an rea filed by psus in for million in revenues and operating income  which addresses a portion of these pre contract costs 
the remaining amounts are currently being negotiated with the us government 
additional construction expenses of million at asus other subsidiaries during were offset by the wastewater expansion project at fort bliss  previously discussed 
for the year ended december   this project generated million in construction expenses 
the project was completed in august and did not recur in goodwill impairment charge during  a charge of million was recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by this guidance  registrant tests goodwill annually for impairment at the reporting unit level  or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable 
registrant evaluates goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for reporting units with goodwill balances 
the realization of goodwill is dependent on expected future cash flows from the underlying operations 
forecasted revenues and capital expenditures  which include forecasted customer connection growth and the timing and amount of regulated rate increases  are key components of the discounted cash flow projections 
during the impairment analysis  registrant determined that revenue growth for its arizona utility  ccwc  was likely to be slower than originally projected due to downturns in overall economic conditions and new housing construction  as well as the current regulatory environment in arizona resulting in regulatory lags and lower than anticipated rate increases 
based on the goodwill impairment analysis  million of goodwill associated with ccwc was found to be impaired and was charged to expense during the fourth quarter of net gain on sale of property for the year ended december   water services recorded a net pretax gain of  on the sale of property primarily related to a gain of  relating to gswc s sale of a parcel of land to the los angeles unified school district for the purpose of constructing a high school
