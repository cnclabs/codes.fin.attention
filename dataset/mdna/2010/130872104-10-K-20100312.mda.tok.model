the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
overview caliper develops and sells innovative and enabling products and services to the life sciences research community  a customer base that includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and government and other not for profit research institutions 
we believe our integrated systems  consisting of instruments  software and reagents  our laboratory automation tools and our assay development and discovery services enable researchers to better understand the basis for disease and more effectively discover safe and effective drugs 
our strategy is to transform drug discovery and development by offering technologies and services that ultimately enhance the ability to predict the effects that new drug candidates will have on humans 
our offerings leverage our extensive portfolio of molecular imaging  microfluidics  automation and liquid handling technologies  and scientific applications expertise to address key opportunities and challenges in the drug discovery and development process namely  the complex and costly process to conceive of and bring a new drug to market 
we believe that increasing the clinical relevance of drug discovery experimentation  whether at early stage  lower cost in vitro in an artificial environment testing or later stage  more expensive  preclinical in vivo in a living organism testing  will have a profound impact in helping our customers to determine the ultimate likelihood of success of drugs in treating humans 
with enabling offerings in both the in vitro and in vivo testing arenas  and a unique strategy of enhancing the bridge or linkages between in vitro and in vivo research testing and between research testing and clinical diagnostic testing  we expect to continue to address growing  unmet needs in the market and drive on going demand for our products and services 
these market needs are underscored by key challenges that face the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  including late stage drug failures and unforeseen side effects coming to light late in the development process or even after drugs are on the market 
we offer an array of products and services  many of which are based on our own proprietary technologies  to address critical experimental needs in drug discovery and preclinical development 
our technologies are also enabling for other life sciences applications beyond drug discovery  such as environmental related testing  and in applied markets such as agriculture and forensics 
we also believe that our technology platforms may be able to provide ease of use  cost and data quality benefits for certain in vitro and in vivo diagnostic applications 
we have multiple channels of distribution for our products direct to customers  indirect through our international network of distributors  through partnership channels under our caliper driven program and through joint marketing agreements 
through our direct and indirect channels  we sell products  services and complete system solutions  developed by us  to end customers 
our caliper driven program is core to our business strategy and complementary to our direct sales and distribution network activities  as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our labchip and advanced liquid handling technologies into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial 
table of contents partners 
we also utilize joint marketing agreements to enable others to market and distribute our products 
by using direct and indirect distribution  and out licensing our technology under our caliper driven program  we seek to maximize penetration of our products and technologies into the marketplace and position caliper as a leader in the life sciences tools market 
our product and service offerings are organized into three core business areas imaging  discovery research research  and caliper discovery alliances and services cdas with the goal of creating a more scalable infrastructure while putting increased focus on growth and profitability 
the imaging business holds  we believe  a global leadership position in the high growth optical molecular imaging market 
principal activities of this business area include the expansion of the ivis imaging instrument system and related reagent product lines  development of new therapeutic area applications and facilitating additional imaging modalities 
the research business area is responsible for utilizing caliper s core automation and microfluidic technologies to address an expanding array of opportunities in drug discovery and life science research  including molecular biology sample preparation and analysis for genomics  proteomics  diagnostics  cellular screening and forensics 
the cdas business area is responsible for expanding drug discovery collaborations and alliances  and increasing sales of drug discovery services 
the focus of cdas is to capitalize on market outsourcing trends  and to offer complementary services to caliper s imaging and research platform solutions 
key highlights xenbio divestiture on december   we completed the sale of our preclinical in vivo contract research services operations  xenogen biosciences corporation xenbio  to taconic farms inc  which is one of the largest providers of rodents for laboratory use in the world 
xenbio was a wholly owned subsidiary of xenogen corporation which we acquired in august the transaction strengthens our ivis imaging tools business  and represents another step in our continuing strategy to divest non core assets in order to further enhance our focus on our core products  applications and services strengths 
in connection with this divestiture  we granted taconic distribution rights to supply our lpta models for our ivis customers 
the transaction price was million  which included million in cash paid to us at closing together with million placed into an escrow account until april  we realized a million gain on the sale of xenbio based upon the net proceeds received to date  which excludes the million escrow  in excess of total divested net assets 
summary financial performance our total revenues for declined by approximately million to million  from million in as a result of recent strategic divestitures 
the divestiture of our former pdq and autotrace product lines in november of and  to a lesser extent  our xenbio operations in december of accounted for million of revenue decline 
excluding the revenue impact of divestitures  total revenue for our ongoing business operations increased by approximately million  or in comparison to revenues in see non gaap revenue table and related discussion below 
this million increase included revenue increases in our research and imaging business units of million and million  respectively  offset by a decline in revenue from our in vitro contract research services of approximately million 
product gross margins increased to in versus in this improvement resulted from favorable product mix changes toward higher gross margin instruments labchip and 
table of contents ivis  increased revenue from consumable sales  and lower material costs resulting from low cost product sourcing initiatives 
service gross margins decreased to in from in due principally to reduced sales experienced by our novascreen operation which resulted in reduced cost leverage 
research and development operating expenses decreased million in in comparison to of this decrease  approximately million resulted from divestitures principally the sale of the pdq product line in the fourth quarter of 
the remaining million of decreased spending resulted from the full year benefit of consolidation and cost reduction efforts implemented in selling  general and administrative operating expenses decreased by million in in comparison to of this decrease  approximately million resulted from divestitures principally the sale of the pdq product line in the fourth quarter of 
the remaining million of decreased spending was comprised of million from lower personnel costs related to cost reduction initiatives designed to align our business along strategic business units net of a million increase in provisions for bonuses based on performance  million in reduced travel spending and million in reductions of all other operating costs 
during  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million 
the net charge was comprised of a million charge in the third quarter of to consolidate our hopkinton  massachusetts manufacturing facility  a million charge in the fourth quarter of to correct our future sublease income assumptions relating to our mountain view  california facility  and a million credit in the fourth quarter of recorded to correct an error in the original measurement of restructuring charges which were recorded in see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
net loss for was million  or per share  compared to net loss of million  or per share in the decrease in net loss was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million that was taken in and other factors discussed above 
revenue performance by strategic business unit the table below provides a reconciliation of our gaap basis revenue to pro forma non gaap revenue results for and  after giving effect to the divestures of the pdq and autotrace product lines which occurred in and the divestiture of xenbio in december we believe this reconciliation provides a useful comparison for evaluating revenue performance between fiscal periods  but these non gaap comparisons are not intended to substitute for gaap financial measures 
year ended december  gaap non gaap adjustments non gaap in thousands gaap chg non gaap chg imaging research cdas total revenue for purposes of comparing growth rates for each of the three principal areas of our business  the above non gaap table reconciliations exclude revenues related to the pdq and autotrace 
table of contents product lines divested in november  as well as revenues related to xenbio which was divested in december currency effects reduced the above growth rates by for both the research and imaging strategic business units  and by on a total revenue basis for the full year 
imaging revenues  net of divestiture effects  increased by on a non gaap basis to million during from million during imaging growth was driven by continued strong global demand for our ivis instruments  including the benefit of recent product introductions which included the ivis kinetic and ivis xr systems  and accessories  reagents and services which are used to profile molecular biology conditions or events in small living mammals  primarily mice  or cells 
research revenues  net of divestiture effects  increased by on a non gaap basis to million during from million during overall research growth was primarily attributable to strong market demand for our labchip gx instruments  increased revenues from microfluidic consumables chips  kits and reagents  increased sales of our zephyr liquid handling instrument and an increase in microfluidic contract and license revenue 
we attribute our growth in each of these sources of revenue to the differentiated capabilities of our products and evolving market interest in the benefits and technological advantages of microfluidics for use in various molecular biology research application areas  such as protein characterization 
cdas revenues  net of divestiture effects  decreased by to million during from million during the net decrease resulted from the completion of government services contracts which ended in  resulting in a million decline in revenue  and task order delays under our ongoing contract with the environmental protection agency epa related to its toxcast screening program  comprising million of the decrease in these revenue decreases were partially offset by in vitro commercial service revenue growth related to a large oncology project with a single customer 
overall economic outlook during  we experienced strong growth and momentum as a result of our positioning in certain markets  such as genomics and molecular imaging  where life science research spending appears to remain strong 
conversely  our cdas business unit experienced a slowdown of revenue due principally to a revenue decline in the area of government contracts 
in november  we received a new task order for million under our services contract with the epa under its toxcast program  but we have yet to receive definitive communication from the epa with respect to the availability of the compounds in order for us to begin work under this task order 
we had expected that our work on this order under the toxcast program would begin early in the second quarter of  and now expect that this work will be further delayed into the second half of for the most part  market demand for our products and services has not materially benefitted from the american reinvestment and recovery act of stimulus package  which we had hoped would stimulate even further demand from end market customers such as government and academic laboratories which draw upon nih funding 
over the second half of  we believe that there was a general easing with respect to capital equipment and outsourced services budgets 
however  we remain cautious with respect to ongoing market demand in light of current general economic conditions and continuing integration among recently merged pharmaceutical companies 
aside from the timing uncertainty with respect to the epa project  we expect that market conditions and demand for our products and services will remain relatively stable over the course of  and in addition we expect that our revenues will benefit to from the recent weakening trend in the us dollar compared to  with most of this favorable currency benefit occurring in the first half of the year 

table of contents results of operations revenue year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands product revenue service revenue license fees and contract revenue total revenue product revenue 
product revenue increased by million  which was comprised of a million increase in continuing product lines and a million decrease due to divested product lines 
this decrease principally related to revenue of our former pdq and autotrace product lines which we sold in the fourth quarter of the million increase in current product offering revenues included increases of  million  or  from imaging product sales and million  or  from research product sales 
the imaging product sales increase was due to a increase in ivis instrument placements as well as a increase in reagent sales related to the ivis product lines 
the ivis instrument product mix during was more heavily comprised of ivis spectrum and new ivis kinetic instruments 
the combination of these two factors resulted in a higher average selling price in addition to an increase in total units sold 
the increase in research product sales was comprised of an increase in microfluidic product revenues of million  or  while automation product revenues decreased by million  or 
the increase in microfluidic revenues during  compared to  was primarily due to a a million increase in sales of our labchip gx instruments which was driven by an increase in instrument placements units in compared to units in  and b a million  or  increase in sales of microfluidic consumables chips  kits and reagents resulting from growth in the installed base of labchip instruments as well as an increase in the usage of profiler pro consumables by a single customer in the decrease in automation product revenues during compared to was primarily due to a a million decrease in revenue from sales of our staccato automated workstation instruments which was primarily the result of a single system sale in the second quarter of  b a million decrease in turbovap instrument sales primarily within our european distribution channel as a result of the economic climate and the fact that the majority of sales are government funded where budgets were limited in  and c a million decrease in other automation revenues  primarily within accessory sales for liquid handling instrumentation 
these decreases were offset in part by a million increase in sales of our zephyr liquid handling instrument and a million increase in sales of our rapidtrace instrument 
product revenue increased during compared to  primarily due to strong imaging sales which increased by million  or  driven by ivis instrument growth  including an increase in instrument placements 
research product sales decreased million  or  during as compared to  primarily as a result of sales decreases caused by a weaker sales of non core products  including the pdq and autotrace product lines  which we divested in november  which decreased by million in  b lower revenue from kinase screening products labchip systems and ez reader instruments due to increased competition from kinase screening outsourcing  which decreased by million  and c overall decreases within our oem relationships and other research product lines  which decreased by million  of which million was related to lost datapoint revenues from a single customer that is no longer in business 
offsetting these decreases within research were a strong sales in our automated sample preparation solutions led by sales of 
table of contents staccato automated workstations and zephyr liquid handling instruments  which increased by million  and b sales of labchip gx and gxii  our latest microfluidic benchtop instruments launched in mid for genomic sample preparation and analysis  which resulted in a million increase 
service revenue 
service revenue decreased million during compared to  which was comprised of a million decrease from divested service offerings and a million net decrease from continuing service platforms 
the divested service offerings decrease was comprised of million in service contract and billable revenue associated with the divested pdq and autotrace product lines that was recognized in prior to the divestiture of those businesses and million in in vivo corporate service revenues related to the divestiture of xenbio 
the million net decrease from current offerings was comprised of a million decrease in cdas service revenues and a million increase in instrument service revenues from imaging and research product offerings 
the cdas decrease was comprised of a million decline in government contract services related to a contract that ended in and million of reduced revenue under our contract with the epa for its toxcast screening program 
these government services declines were partially offset by a million increase in commercial in vitro screening contracts revenues which was attributed to a large oncology project with a single customer 
the million increase in instrument service revenues was primarily due to a million increase in service contract revenues generated from the imaging installed base  a million increase within automation billable service revenues and a million increase from all other service contract and billable revenues 
service revenue was flat during compared to  consisting of a million increase from instrument based services driven primarily by increases in the installed bases of ivis imaging and labchip microfluidic instruments  net of a million decrease from service revenues related to the pdq and autotrace product lines which were sold in the fourth quarter of and a million decrease in cdas service revenues 
the cdas revenue decline included the loss of million from a single customer contract that was not renewed in  a million decrease related to timing delays under a single contract with a particular customer in comparison to similar prior year revenues  and a million decrease under the epa toxcast screening contract in comparison to revenues 
the effects of these declines were partially offset by revenue increases from other cdas service platforms including imaging studies  transgenic animal production  and in vitro screening projects 
license fees and contract revenue 
license fees and contract revenue increased million during compared to primarily from an increase in microfluidic license revenues of approximately million  net of a decline in cdas government grant revenues of approximately million related to expired contracts 
in general  we have experienced increased interest from biotechnology companies in obtaining access to our portfolio of microfluidic patent rights spurred by expansion of platforms which benefit from the technological advantages of microfluidics 
license fees and contract revenue decreased during compared to primarily as a result of anticipated declines in both non recurring microfluidic license revenues of million and contract research collaboration revenue of million 
these declines were due to collaboration arrangements completed in  including related license revenues stemming from these arrangements 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in imaging license revenues of million during compared to the increase in imaging license revenue was due in part to favorable purchase accounting effects of million which resulted from contract renewals at full value versus the lower recorded fair value of such contracts pursuant to purchase accounting rules applied to the purchase of xenogen in 
table of contents cost of revenue year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands cost of product revenue service revenue license revenue total cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue decreased by million in compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in material costs as a percentage of sales  and to a small extent from reductions in manufacturing labor costs 
the reduction in materials costs was attributable to favorable product mix changes increased labchip and ivis instrument sales and sourcing initiatives to reduce the cost of materials 
cost of product revenue increased during compared to  primarily due to the overall increase in product sales 
the impact of increased revenues  however  was further affected by higher material costs which resulted from third party manufactured components which comprise staccato system sales which accounted for a substantial portion of the product revenue increase as discussed above 
material costs within cost of product revenue were approximately of sales in versus in  while other variable product costs were approximately of product sales versus in  reflecting increased inventory reserve allowance and other manufacturing variances 
offsetting these higher material and other variable costs was a million decrease in installation and product warranty labor costs compared to cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue decreased during as compared to  primarily due to personnel reductions resulting from divested product lines  as well as a million reduction from our divestiture of xenbio in december in addition  during  cost of service revenue decreased by million related to reduced spending within our in vitro services business  primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues and the related purchase of materials 
cost of service revenue increased during as compared to primarily related to increases in facility costs of our cdas businesses which increased by million over as a result of the renewal of leases in both our cranbury  new jersey and hanover  maryland locations  coupled with an expansion of space in hanover 
in addition  an increase in project materials spending accounted for an additional million of the overall increase 
beyond these factors  the remaining increase is driven by the allocation of resources to support instrument driven service revenues service contracts  billables and training due in large part to the increase in the installed base of ivis imaging and micro fluidic instruments being serviced 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue  which is comprised of royalty payments to third parties as a result of our licensing activities  was flat in compared to primarily as a result of the obligations to third parties on fees received being relatively unchanged 
although the contract and license revenues from microfluidic and imaging technologies increased by million  not all these revenues were subject to third party royalties and the license revenues within represented a greater concentration of internally developed patents versus third party patents  compared to cost of license revenue decreased during compared to primarily as a result of the substantial microfluidic revenue decline discussed above 

table of contents gross margins 
gross margin on product revenue was for  which was an improvement of percentage points  compared to the same period in the improvement was driven by favorable product mix ie  instruments with lower cost relative to average selling price and the benefit of volume leverage of fixed costs and ongoing sourcing initiatives to lower our material costs 
gross margin on service revenue was for  as compared to for this decreased service margin resulted primarily from reduced cost leverage within the cdas in vitro services business during product gross margins decreased to in  from in  despite the overall increase in product revenues and a million reduction in manufacturing spending as noted in cost of revenues above 
the primary reason for this decrease was the mix of revenues  which featured  for example  a greater percentage of sales from staccato automated workstations compared to  which carried much higher material cost content 
gross margin on service revenue was for and for approximately basis points of the decrease in service margin resulted primarily from higher facility costs and project material costs within cdas  and the effect of lower revenues in relation to fixed spending levels as a result of certain contract delays that resulted during the year 
the remaining decline in service gross margin was driven by an increase of labor and material costs incurred related to instrument service revenues

research and development spending decreased by million during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of million in reduced facilities costs  relating to the consolidation and cost reduction efforts initiated in  million in reduced material and operating supplies  a million reduction in severance costs during which related to actions taken in the first quarter of and a decrease in all other costs of million 
research and development spending decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in these cost reductions were the result of reduced spending related to microfluidic collaboration projects that ended in  savings from cost reduction initiatives implemented in the second quarter of  and the consolidation of our west coast research and development operations in the first quarter of the overall net decrease was comprised of cost reductions including million in personnel related costs  million in material and operating supplies  million in allocated facility and information technology costs  and million of all other costs  which were partially offset by million of severance charges 

table of contents we continue to evaluate research and development spending based on anticipated revenues and market opportunities 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to generally decrease in the future  to the extent our revenues continue to grow  and as we continue to closely manage discretionary spending on research programs with attractive commercial potential 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  due primarily to a million reduction in selling and marketing costs 
this decrease in selling and marketing costs consist of a million reduction in salaries and related costs due to reduced headcount from the divested product lines as well as cost reduction initiatives in to align our selling and marketing resources along strategic business units net of a million increase in provisions for bonuses based on performance  a million reduction in travel and related costs  a million reduction in costs relating to materials  office and operating supplies and a reduction of million in all other costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million during as compared to  primarily due to a reduction in consulting and other professional fees  net of an increase in personnel related costs  primarily provisions for bonuses based upon performance 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily general and administration related million and included million reduction of litigation costs related to a settlement charge incurred in and paid in  a million reduction in litigation defense costs which included million of proceeds from a mediated settlement in our favor  a million reduction for legal and advisory services related to merger and acquisition activities in  a million reduction in personnel related costs due to headcount reductions  a million reduction in stock compensation expense  and a decrease in all other general and administrative costs of million 
in addition to the foregoing  selling and marketing expenses decreased by million during primarily due to the decrease in stock compensation expense 
impairment of goodwill 
we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill to determine if impairment exists  and may perform a test for the impairment of goodwill more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
no impairment of goodwill was identified in fiscal years and in  as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis  we determined that goodwill was impaired by million 
the goodwill impairment assessment is more fully discussed in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  related to assets acquired with our acquisitions of zymark  novascreen and xenogen 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to novascreen intangibles that was recorded within amortization expense see footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the decreases in amortization during and are primarily related to the fact that the zymark intangibles were amortized as of july  the decrease in amortization is also due  in part  to certain intangibles amortization being computed based upon the estimated timing of the undiscounted cash flows used to value each respective asset over the estimated useful life of the particular intangible asset  which results in reducing amortization over the life of the assets 
restructuring charges  net 
we incurred restructuring charges in  and related to consolidation of facilities  as well as acquisition and integration activities that are more fully discussed in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on 
table of contents form k 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the third quarter related to the consolidation of manufacturing operations at our hopkinton  massachusetts  facility which was enabled by the product line divestitures completed in the fourth quarter of and continued efforts to reduce operating costs 
we estimate that ongoing facility related cash outflow  primarily rent payments net of sublease income  will be spread over the years remaining on our hopkinton  massachusetts lease 
this partial facility closure has been accounted for in accordance with fasb asc  pursuant to which we have recorded a liability equal to the fair value of the remaining lease payments  net of expected sublease payments  as of the cease use date 
we expect this initiative to result in lower expensed facility costs of approximately million per year 
in addition  in  we revised our assumptions around the restructuring charge taken in regarding our mountain view  california facility 
the effect of the change was to update the sublease timing and rates assumed as a result of the current real estate market  which resulted in a charge of million 
in addition  we recorded a credit of million to restructuring charges to correct an error that we identified in the fourth quarter of related to the original restructuring charges taken in the net effect of these adjustments and the error correction was a credit of million within the fourth quarter of restructuring charges during related to recording a restructuring charge of million for our west coast consolidation which included a million charge in the third quarter along with a revision to the sublease assumption of million during the fourth quarter based on the deteriorating sublease market in mountain view  california  and the related abandonment of approximately  square feet of space in mountain view  california 
this facility closure has been accounted for in accordance with fasb asc  pursuant to which we have recorded a liability equal to the fair value of the remaining lease payments  net of expected sublease payments  as of the cease use date 
we expect this initiative to result in lower expensed facility costs of approximately million per year

interest income decreased in both and primarily due to reduced interest yields and a shorter overall maturity duration with respect to our cash equivalent and marketable securities investments 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased during compared to  as a result of a decrease in our weighted average outstanding credit facility borrowings which were million during compared to million during during  we sought to maintain lower average outstanding borrowings in order to mitigate interest costs  especially in light of limited yields available on cash equivalent and marketable security investment opportunities 
interest expense modestly declined during compared to primarily as a result of the decrease in the prime interest rate  even though outstanding borrowings increased by million in 
table of contents gain on divestitures 
in december  we divested our xenbio subsidiary and recorded a gain of million  which is more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
in november  we divested our pdq and autotrace product lines and recorded a gain of million and an additional gain of million in when funds were released from escrow  which is more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
other income expense  net 
net other income expense  net decreased in compared to due primarily to an increase in transaction losses on foreign denominated accounts receivable resulting from a weaker us dollar  on average for  in comparison to primarily the euro  the british pound and swiss franc  offset in part by a stronger us dollar  on average for  in comparison to the japanese yen 
during  we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of approximately  compared to gains of  in this increase in expense was offset in part by a million increase in sublease income from our st

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term restricted cash in addition to approximately million of additional borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility described below  under which we had outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letter of credits of approximately million as of december  on december   we entered into a first loan modification agreement with a bank  amending our credit facility  which is reflected by the second amended and restated loan and security agreement dated as of march  the principal effect of this modification was to extend the maturity date of the credit facility from november  to april  the modification also established financial covenants for us for the quarter ending march   as well as modified certain of the existing financial reporting covenants that are tested as of the last day of each quarter 
the credit facility permits us to borrow up to million in the form of revolving loan advances  including up to million in the form of letters of credit and other contingent reserves 
principal borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a floating annual rate equal to the prime rate plus one percent if our unrestricted cash held at the bank exceeds or is equal to million  or prime plus two percent if our unrestricted cash held at the bank is below million 
under the credit facility  we are permitted to borrow up to million  subject to a borrowing base limit consisting of a of eligible accounts receivable plus b the lesser of of our unrestricted cash at the bank or million  provided  that on each of the first three business days and each of the last three business days of each fiscal quarter  the borrowing base is a of eligible accounts receivable plus b the lesser of of our unrestricted cash at the bank or million 
eligible accounts receivable do not include internationally billed receivables  unbilled receivables  and receivables aged over days from invoice date 
the credit facility serves as a source of capital for ongoing operations and working capital needs 
the credit facility includes traditional lending and reporting covenants including that certain financial covenants applicable to liquidity and earnings are to be maintained by us and tested as of the last day of each quarter 
we expect to remain in compliance with the covenants through the credit facility s maturity date based on current forecasts 
the credit facility also includes subjective rights for the bank to accelerate the maturity date of the debt  lower the borrowing base or stop making advances  which are typical within asset based lending arrangements 
we do not believe the bank will exercise these rights as long as we are meeting our covenants and are achieving our forecasts 
the credit facility also includes several potential events of 
table of contents default such as payment default  material adverse change conditions and insolvency conditions that could cause interest to be charged at the interest rate in effect as of the date of default plus two percentage points  or in the event of any uncured events of default including non compliance with liquidity and earnings financial covenants  could result in the bank s right to declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable  to modify the borrowing base formula described above to reduce credit availability  or to cease making advances to us 
should an event of default occur  including the exercise of a material adverse change condition  and based on such default the bank were to decide to either i declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable  ii reduce our borrowing base  or iii stop making credit advances to us  we may be required to significantly reduce our costs and expenses  sell additional equity or debt securities  or restructure portions of our business which could involve the sale of certain assets 
we believe  based on our current projections that the bank will continue to lend to us subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
furthermore  additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in this circumstance  if we could not significantly reduce our costs and expenses  obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms when such financing is required or restructure portions of our business  our business would be adversely affected 
in addition  the amount of available capital that we are able to access under the credit facility at any particular time is dependent upon the borrowing base formula  which ultimately relies on the underlying performance of the business 
if economic conditions worsen and our business performance is not as strong as anticipated  then we could experience an event of default or a reduction in borrowing capacity under the credit facility  which if not cured to the bank s satisfaction  could have a potential adverse impact on our ability to access capital under our credit facility in order to fund operations 
if such events were to occur  our business would be adversely affected 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing  and financing activities 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in businesses  product development  restructured facility obligations  and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our credit facility 
significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for our products  our ability to integrate acquisitions  deterioration in certain financial ratios  and market changes in general 
we believe our cash balance  working capital on hand at december  and access to available capital under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through at least march  nevertheless  our actual cash needs could vary considerably  depending on opportunities and circumstances that arise over time 
if  at any time  cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to reduce our costs and expenses  sell additional equity or debt securities or draw down on our current credit facility if we have borrowing capacity 
the inability to obtain additional financing may force other actions such as the sale of certain assets  or  ultimately  cause us to cease operations 
on november   we filed  and the securities and exchange commission subsequently declared effective  a universal shelf registration statement on form s that will permit us to raise up to million of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants or units  either individually or in units  as described by the prospectus 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
furthermore  additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that we will be successful in these endeavors 
we maintain cash balances in many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences

table of contents our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and acquisitions 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continuing our research and development efforts  expanding our support and product development activities  and for other general corporate activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued market acceptance of our microfluidic and lab automation products  and the demand for our services  the magnitude and scope of our research and product development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control 
financial projections caliper is currently projecting organic revenue growth of between in over pro forma revenue of million 
assuming current exchange rates  foreign currency is expected to have a positive impact of to percentage points on revenue growth in the first half of  and a slightly unfavorable impact on revenue growth on a full year basis 
we anticipate that timing of service revenues within the year will vary based upon the receipt of compounds related to services to be performed under our epa toxcast screening contract 
the financial projections that we have provided above are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and are only made as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
these projections are based upon assumptions that we have made and believe to be reasonable 
however  actual results may vary significantly from these projections due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business as described in item a  risk factors 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   caliper did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as that term is defined in the rules and regulations of the sec 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
we use estimates when accounting for certain items such as warranty expense  sales and marketing programs  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  and valuations of investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to changing 
table of contents conditions or the validity of our assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria 
we allocate the consideration among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices  and consider the applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
we adopted asu no 
and asu in the third quarter of  both prospectively and effective beginning on january  this new revenue guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable in a sale arrangement 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe or tpe is available 
the amendments in this asu eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable on the basis of the deliverable s selling price 
the amount of our product revenue is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  the selling price hierarchy for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish the selling price for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
these conditions are sometimes subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
we recognize certain service and contract revenue for certain arrangements based upon proportional performance which requires that we estimate resources required to perform the work 
the extent to which our resource estimates prove to be inaccurate could affect the timing of the revenue recognition for a particular contract arrangement 
our revenue recognition policies are more fully discussed in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
goodwill 
we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill to determine if impairment exists 
we may perform a test for the impairment of goodwill more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
caliper is comprised of a single segment which is our sole reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
however  if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
fair value is determined by utilizing information about our company as well as publicly available industry information 
determining fair value involves judgments by our management and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including point in time estimates of revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  perpetuity growth rates  future capital expenditures and future market conditions  among others 
our projections are based on an internal strategic review 
key assumptions  strategies  opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment 
the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner that is similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
in determining the fair value of net assets we determined the fair value of leases and certain intangible assets  including trademarks  patents  core and developed technologies and customer relationships 

table of contents our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the results of the impairment test are as of a point in time 
if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated and or our market capitalization declines  this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years  and additional impairment charges may need to be recorded 
to the extent goodwill is impaired  its carrying value will be further written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our results of operations 
such an impairment charge would materially and adversely affect our gaap reported operating results 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill of million in our consolidated balance sheet 
no impairment of goodwill was identified in fiscal years and in  with the sales of our pdq and autotrace product lines in the fourth quarter of that year  which met the criteria for assets held for sale in october  prior to our goodwill impairment test date  we first determined the amount of goodwill million that was to be allocated to these product groupings based upon their recent transaction values  and then applied our annual analysis to the remaining goodwill balance million  which resulted in the determination that impairment had occurred 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill 
the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill  resulting in a goodwill impairment of million 
the goodwill impairment charge is non cash in nature and does not affect our liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  or debt covenants  or have any impact on future operations 
valuation of intangibles 
our business acquisitions have resulted in intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization of million as of december  the determination of the value of such assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we acquired xenogen on august  in connection with this acquisition we used an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of intangibles related to the xenogen business 
the fair value was determined based upon projected future discounted cash flows of identified intangible assets taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of developed technology 
the valuation approach took into consideration discount rates commensurate with the inherent risk and projected financial results associated with each identified intangible asset 
applicable discount rates used ranged from to 
impairment 
we review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we perform the recoverability measurement and estimate undiscounted cash flows at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate the resulting impairment charge to be recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
actual cash flows could vary from the assumptions used in our assessment which could require future adjustments to our valuation of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during  there was a million impairment charge related to novascreen intangibles that was recorded within amortization expense see footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their fair values 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using a black scholes merton based option pricing model 
various assumptions are used in these estimations  including expected volatility  which is based on historical volatility of our stock and warrants  expected option term  which is based on our historical option exercise data taking into consideration the exercise patterns of the option holders during the option s life  risk free interest rate  based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and forfeiture rate 
a unfavorable change in expected volatility and option term  which represent the most sensitive and judgmental assumptions  would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
accounts receivable reserves 
we grant credit to customers based on evaluations of their financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
we attempt to limit credit risk by monitoring our exposure for credit losses 
this analysis may involve review of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
we establish allowances for those accounts considered uncollectible based on the analysis of the recoverability of our trade accounts receivable performed at the end of each reporting period 
establishing an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts involves the use of considerable judgment and subjectivity 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to estimate the adequacy of our accounts receivable reserves which could require future adjustment to our reserve provisions 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  and million as of december  and  respectively 
we wrote off   and  of accounts deemed uncollectible in  and  respectively 
the write off in relates to a distributor of our pdq product line 
the amount of the write off was fully reserved in prior years and was written off in as it was deemed uncollectible 
inventory reserves 
we reserve or write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excess 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using management s best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
we use a twelve month demand forecast and  in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be impacted by engineering changes  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
determination of the excess balance is highly subjective and relies in part on the accuracy of our forecasts and our assessment of market conditions 
if actual conditions are less favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  additional write downs may be required 
conversely  if conditions are more favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations in that period 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of million  million and million  respectively  to cost of product revenues for excess and obsolete inventories 
the increases in excess and obsolete inventories occurred primarily as a result of product evolution and new product introductions 
warranty provision 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
we offer a one year limited warranty on instrumentation products and a day warranty on chips  which is 
table of contents included in the sales price of many of its products 
our standard limited warranty covers repair or replacement of defective goods  a preventative maintenance visit on certain products  and telephone based technical support 
no upgrades are included in the standard warranty 
provision is made for estimated future warranty costs at the time of sale 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of million  million and million to cost of product revenues for estimated warranty costs 
the increase in relates primarily to the increase in product sales of liquid handling and automation products 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to establish the warranty liability which could require future adjustments to our reserve positions 
restructuring charges 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded restructuring charges of million  million and million  respectively  for exit plan activities which took place in the period and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  fasb asc  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
for example  the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including with respect to contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  and ability of the tenant to pay leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sublease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sublease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sublease arrangement 
if the rental markets change  our sublease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
recent accounting pronouncements newly adopted accounting pronouncements during the third quarter of  caliper adopted the guidance of asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangement that include software elements which were ratified by the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force on september  asu no 
affects accounting and reporting for all multiple deliverable arrangements 
it also affects companies that are affected by the amendments of asu no 
the impact of these standards was not material to our reported results of operations 
refer to our revenue recognition policies for further discussion 
in june  the fasb issued the accounting standards codification asc as the single source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
while the adoption of the asc as of september  changes how we reference accounting standards  the adoption did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  or accounting policies 
in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of asc had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asc  business combinations 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
asc provides that  upon initially obtaining control  an acquirer shall recognize percent of the fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired percent of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
additionally  asc changes current practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs will be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies  such as legal issues  will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value  in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  the requirements in asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  would have to be met at the acquisition date  and in process research and development charges will no longer be recorded 
with the adoption of asc goodwill is no longer reduced when utilizing net operating loss carry forwards for which a full valuation allowance exists 
the adoption of asc did not materially affect our results as we did not complete any business combinations in however  it may have a material impact on how we account for future business combinations 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
r fsp fas r  accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies subsequently this standard has been codified under fasb asc topic 
the revised authoritative guidance provides additional clarification on the initial recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies 
the revised authoritative guidance is effective for all fiscal years beginning on or after december  to date  the revised authoritative guidance has not had a significant impact on the accounting for any businesses that we have acquired 
however  it may have a material impact on how we account for future acquisitions 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
eitf no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf no 
is effective for collaborative arrangements in place at the beginning of the annual period beginning after december  as our collaborative agreements do not incorporate such revenue and cost sharing arrangements  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency as a multinational company  we are subject to changes in foreign currency fluctuations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  switzerland  canada and japan 
to the extent our sales and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  our operating results 
table of contents may be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates 
while foreign exchange gains and losses have historically been immaterial  we cannot predict whether such gains and losses will continue to be immaterial 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in exchange rates applied to our projected foreign operations for the fiscal year a hypothetical movement in exchange rates could materially impact our reported sales 
however  because both sales and expenses are denominated in local currency  this analysis indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on net operating results or financial condition 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments at either december  or as of december  we had million in debt outstanding under our credit facility 
the interest rate on the facility is based on the prime rate currently and therefore has direct and immediate response to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  and corporate bonds 
our portfolio excludes auction rate securities 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december  and  the average remaining maturities of our investment portfolio were approximately six and one months  respectively 
all of our instruments are held other than for trading purposes 
as of december  and  unrealized losses were considered to be temporary due to the fact that although they are available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise  securities are generally held to maturity 
the following table presents by year of maturity the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments  and related weighted average interest rates that may be subject to interest rate risk as of december  total fair value december  cash and money market funds fixed rate securities in thousands average interest rate available for sale marketable securities fixed rate securities in thousands average interest rate total securities in thousands average interest rate
