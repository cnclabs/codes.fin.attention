major trends affecting our financial results company outlook we believe that our current value proposition  which enables customers to improve the performance of their applications and access to their data across wans  while also offering the ability to simplify it infrastructure and realize significant capital and operating cost savings  should allow us to 
table of contents continue to grow our business 
our product revenue growth rate will depend significantly on continued growth in the wan optimization market  and our ability to continue to attract new customers in that market and generate additional sales from existing customers 
our growth in support and services revenue is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders  product mix  average selling prices and costs of our products and general economic conditions 
our ability to achieve profitability in the future will also be affected by the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  support  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation 
revenue our revenue has grown rapidly since we began shipping products in may  increasing from million in to million in revenue grew by in to million from million in we believe that our revenue growth in  when the global macroeconomic environment negatively impacted many businesses  is a positive sign that our products have a significant value proposition to our customers and that the wan optimization market is still expanding despite the challenging macroeconomic environment 
costs and expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative expenses  and acquisition related costs 
personnel related costs  including stock based compensation  are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
as of december   we had  employees  an increase of from the employees at december  the increase in employees is the most significant driver behind the increase in costs and operating expenses in the increase in employees was required to support our increased revenue 
the timing of additional hires has and could materially affect our operating expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in any particular period 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes were million  million  and million in the years ended december    and respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant stock based compensation expense and anticipate further growth in stock based compensation expense as our employee base grows because we expect stock based compensation to continue to play an important part in the overall compensation structure for our employees 
stock based compensation expense and related payroll tax was as follows year ended december  in thousands cost of product cost of support and services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes 
table of contents acquisition of mazu on february   we acquired mazu networks  inc we made an initial payment totaling million in cash  and potentially will make additional payments totaling up to million in cash based on achievement of certain bookings targets for the one year period from april  through march  the estimated fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration as of the acquisition date to be distributed directly to shareholders was recognized as part of the purchase price of mazu 
changes in the fair value of this liability are recognized in earnings as acquisition related costs in the period of the change in estimate 
actual achievement of bookings below million would reduce the liability to zero and achievement of bookings of million or more would increase the liability to million 
the achievement of actual bookings has been  and in the future could be  different than our estimates and could have a material effect on the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration which will be recognized in earnings in the period of the change in estimate 
the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration to be distributed directly to shareholders  originally estimated at the acquisition date at million  discounted at  excluded the fair value estimate of million to be paid to former employees of mazu 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration recognized as a result of the acquisition of mazu was reduced to million  due to a reduction in management s estimate of the probability weighted bookings 
the change in the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration resulted in a net gain of million for the year ended december  the contractual earn out formula is tiered with significant increases in consideration at each tier 
if actual bookings achieve the next tier of consideration  the contingent consideration would increase by million or more 
if actual bookings do not achieve the next tier of consideration  the contingent consideration would decrease by million 
the resulting increase or decrease in the acquisition related contingent consideration will be recognized in earnings during the three months ended march  the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration to be paid to former employees of mazu acquisition related compensation costs is considered compensatory  which has been and will continue to be recognized over the service period from february  to march  during the year ended december   we recognized million of acquisition related compensation costs 
if actual bookings achieve the next tier of consideration per the earn out formula  the acquisition related compensation costs would increase by million  or more 
if actual bookings do not achieve the next tier of consideration  the acquisition related compensation costs would decrease by million 
the adjusted remaining unamortized acquisition related compensation costs will be recognized in earnings during the three months ended march  the results of operations of mazu are included in our consolidated results for the period subsequent to the acquisition date of february  in the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue from mazu products and services and recorded million in operating expenses  which includes the costs of assuming former mazu employees

table of contents the following table summarizes the acquisition related compensation costs recognized in operating expenses  and the acquisition related costs for the twelve months ended december  in thousands year ended december  sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total acquisition related compensation costs acquisition related costs total critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements could be adversely affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation  accounting for business combinations  accounting for income taxes  inventory valuation and allowances for doubtful accounts 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition for a majority of our products  our software is generally integrated on appliance hardware and functions together with the appliance hardware to provide the essential functionality of the product 
as a result  we account for revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  software  for all transactions involving the sale of software 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  which is when product title transfers to the customer  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses 
product sales include a perpetual license to our software 
product revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of title at shipment  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
product revenue on sales to channel partners is recorded once we have received persuasive evidence of an end user and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
substantially all of our product sales have been sold in combination with support services  which consist of software updates and support 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the 
table of contents term of the support period 
support includes access to technical support personnel and content via the internet and telephone 
support services also include an extended warranty for the repair or replacement of defective hardware 
revenue for support services is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one year 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
through december   in virtually all of our contracts  the only element that remained undelivered at the time of delivery of the product was support and updates 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately  and vsoe for support services is measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
stock based compensation stock based awards granted include stock options  restricted stock units rsus  and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan the purchase plan 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the awards  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits due to tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefit are classified as financing activities within our statement of cash flows 
accounting for business combinations in our business combinations  we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the 
table of contents management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include but are not limited to the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  which is performed using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based upon the forecasted achievement of post acquisition bookings targets  the future expected cash flows from product sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  and the discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
additionally  any change in the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes from events after the acquisition date  such as changes in our estimate of the bookings that are expected to be achieved  will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change 
a change in fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration could have a material affect on the statement of operations and financial position in the period of the change in estimate 
goodwill  intangible assets and impairment assessments goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if certain indicators are present 
in the event that we determine that the carrying value of our single reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s fair value  we will incur an impairment charge for the amount of the difference during the quarter in which the determination is made 
we performed our annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of and concluded that no impairment existed at december  intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite life are amortized over their useful lives 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
the carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
in the event that we determine certain assets are not fully recoverable  we will incur an impairment charge for those assets or portion thereof during the quarter in which the determination is made 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax expense and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current income tax expense together with assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax purposes versus financial accounting purposes 
table of contents that may create net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we rely on estimates and assumptions in preparing our income tax provision including forecasted annual income 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  as well as other relevant factors 
we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses  future changes in income tax law  or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results  we make certain judgments and estimates 
therefore  actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation 
in the event of an impairment charge associated with goodwill  such charges are generally not tax deductible and would increase the effective tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
we are subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain tax positions we have taken  such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
a portion of our inventory relates to evaluation units located at customer locations  as some of our customers test our equipment prior to purchasing 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand is written down to its estimated realizable value based on historical usage  expected demand  and with respect to evaluation units  the historical conversion rate  age of the units and the estimated loss of utility 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products  the timing of new product introductions and technological obsolescence of our products 
inventory write downs are reflected as cost of product and amounted to million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the applicable portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
for those receivables not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses and from support and services 
product revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our steelhead products and is typically recognized upon shipment 
support and services revenue includes unspecified software license updates and product support 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period  which is typically one year 
service revenue includes professional services and training  which to date has not been significant  and is recognized as the services are performed

substantially all of our customers purchase support when they purchase our products 
the increase in support and services revenue on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues is a result of a larger installed base due to increased product and first year support sales combined with an increase in the renewal rate of support contracts by existing customers 
as our customer base grows  we expect the proportion of revenue generated from support and services to increase  however  after increasing our renewal rate over the past year  we expect the renewal rate to remain level 
in each of the years ended december  and  we derived of our revenue from indirect channels 
we expect indirect channel revenue to continue to be a substantial majority of our revenue

we utilize third parties to assist in the design of and to manufacture our appliance hardware  embed our proprietary software and perform shipping logistics 
cost of support and service revenue consists of personnel costs of technical support and professional services personnel  spare parts and logistics services 
as we expand internationally and into other sectors  we may incur additional costs to conform our products to comply with local laws or local product specifications 
in addition  as we expand internationally  we will continue to hire additional technical support personnel to support our growing international customer base 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of our products  new product introductions and enhancements  the cost of our appliance hardware  expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations  cost of support and service personnel  and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold

table of contents compared to the increase in cost of product revenue was due primarily to increased unit volume associated with higher revenue 
the increase in cost of product revenue was primarily due to increased manufacturing overhead of million  and amortization of acquisition related intangibles of million 
manufacturing overhead includes costs of manufacturing personnel and related costs  logistics services  and royalties 
these increases were offset by lower per unit purchase price of product of million  lower inventory write downs of million  lower warranty related costs of million  and lower shipping costs of million 
cost of support and services revenue increased as we added more technical support headcount domestically and abroad to support our growing customer base 
technical support and services headcount was employees as of december  compared to employees as of december  additionally  costs related to freight  logistics  and inventory consumption increased due to increased infrastructure to support the increased installed base 
product gross margins increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  primarily due lower unit product costs  lower inventory write downs  lower warranty costs which were partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead and acquisition related intangible amortization 
gross margins for support and services increased to as a result of revenues increasing at a higher rate than support and services costs

cost of product revenue in the year ended december  also includes million of a write down of inventory on hand in excess of forecasted demand compared to inventory obsolescence costs in the year ended december  of million 
the increase in the write down of inventory is related to the write down of legacy inventory as we transition to the series steelhead appliances

gross margins for support and services increased to as a result of revenues increasing at a higher rate than support and services costs 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease in support margins of approximately as a result of increased stock based compensation  which was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and include personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers  and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to make investments in sales and marketing with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base by increasing the number of sales personnel worldwide  expanding our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  increasing channel penetration  building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events 
we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase and continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive and sales and marketing expenses do not immediately result in increased revenue 
hiring additional sales personnel reduces short term operating margins until the sales personnel become productive and 
table of contents generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance

as of december   the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration recognized as a result of the acquisition of mazu was reduced to million from our acquisition date estimated fair value of million  primarily due to a reduction in the probability weighted bookings estimate 
the change in the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration resulted in a net gain of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we also recorded transaction costs such as legal  accounting  valuation and other professional services of million and integration related costs of million 
the following table summarizes the acquisition related costs  including changes in the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration to be distributed directly to shareholders of mazu  transaction costs and integration related costs  recognized in the year ended december  in thousands year ended december  transaction costs severance integration costs change in fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration acquisition related costs

provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our income tax provision benefit consists of federal  foreign  and state income taxes 
our effective tax rate was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for as compared to was primarily the result of the income tax benefit recorded in associated with the reversal of the valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state taxes  significant permanent differences and the change in our valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets 
significant permanent differences arise from the portion of stock based compensation expense that is not expected to generate a tax deduction  such as stock compensation expense on grants to certain foreign employees  our purchase plan and incentive stock options  offset by the actual tax benefits in the current periods from disqualifying dispositions of those shares 
for years prior to  we recorded a full valuation allowance because of the uncertainty of the realization of the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our historical levels of income  expectations of future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies 
in the year ended december   management reevaluated the need for a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets as a result of cumulative profits generated in the most recent three 
table of contents year period as well as other positive evidence 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets and recorded a benefit of million 
this benefit was partially offset by a provision for income taxes of million related to federal  state and local taxes 
at december  we maintained a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets 
in the year ended december   management reevaluated the need for a valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient future taxable income to utilize our foreign deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of million in as part of our accounting for the acquisition of mazu  we established deferred tax assets for federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards that are subject to limitation under sections and of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to a portion of the federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards that we do not expect to be realized 
any subsequent reduction of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits will be recorded to our provision for income taxes 
we are subject to potential income tax audits on open tax years by any taxing jurisdiction which we operate in 
the taxing authorities of the most significant jurisdictions are the united states internal revenue service  california franchise tax board and hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom uk 
we do not anticipate any material adjustments to our tax provisions relating to previously filed tax returns 
the statute of limitations for federal  state  and uk tax purposes are generally three  four  and three years respectively  however  we continue to carryover tax attributes prior to these periods for federal and state purposes  which would still be open for examination by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  all years since our inception are open to tax examinations for federal and state purposes 
our uk tax returns from to the present are open for examination

as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
in addition  a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last month of the quarter  which we believe reflects customer buying patterns of products similar to ours and other products in the technology industry generally 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term 
commencing with the first shipment of our products in the second quarter of  revenue has increased sequentially in all but one quarter  due to increases in the number of products and support and services sold to new and existing customers and international expansion 
cost of revenue has increased sequentially each quarter in absolute dollars  but has decreased over time as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in gross margins is primarily due to higher margins on product revenue as a result of lower unit product costs 
operating expenses have increased over time  as we continued to add headcount and related costs to accommodate our growing business

marketable securities consist of government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills and corporate bonds and notes 
the fair value of marketable securities is determined as the exit price in the principal market in which we would transact 
the fair value of our marketable securities has not materially fluctuated from historical cost 
the accumulated unrealized gains losses  net of tax  on marketable securities recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our stockholders equity as of december  is million 
the recent volatility in the credit markets has increased the risk of material fluctuations in the fair value of marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by million to million in the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by issuance of common stock  net of cash used to net settle equity awards under our employee stock plans of million was offset by significant cash expenditures in the year ended december   including million in share repurchases  million paid for the acquisition of mazu  net of cash acquired  and million used to pay down debt acquired in the acquisition of mazu 
pursuant to certain lease agreements and as security for our merchant services agreement with our financial institution  we are required to maintain cash reserves  classified as restricted cash 
current restricted cash totaled million at december  and million at december  current restricted cash is included in prepaid and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and consists primarily of collateral for letters of credit for the security deposit on the sublease of our corporate headquarters and is restricted until the end of the term of the sublease on august  long term restricted cash totaled million at december  and million at december  long term restricted cash is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consists primarily of funds held as collateral for letters of credit for the security deposit on the leases of our corporate headquarters and is restricted until the end of the lease terms on july  since the fourth quarter of  we have expanded our operations internationally 
our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and therefore changes in foreign exchange rates have not materially affected our cash flows from operations 
as we fund our international operations  our cash and cash equivalents are affected by changes in exchange rates 
to date  the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been material 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is the cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  product costs  outside services  and rent payments 
our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we grow our revenue and spend on hiring personnel in order to grow our business 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and related cash flows from their sales efforts 
cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  primarily due to increased profitability after excluding the effects of non cash stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization 
cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to investments in marketable securities  capital expenditures to support our growth and cash used in acquisitions 
cash used in investing activities increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the million paid for the acquisition of mazu  net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of million 
this was partially offset by lower purchases of marketable securities and lower capital expenditures 
cash flows used in financing activities cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december  cash used for repurchases of common stock was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   cash provided from the exercise of stock options was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   and cash used to pay down the debt acquired in the acquisition of mazu was million in the year ended december  on april   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program  which authorizes us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock during a period not to exceed months from the board authorization date 
the program does not require us to purchase a minimum number of shares  and may be suspended  modified or discontinued at any time 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock under this program for an aggregate purchase price of million  or an average of per share 
in  we repurchased  shares of common stock under this program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or an average of per share 
the timing and amounts of these repurchases were based on market conditions and other factors including price  regulatory requirements and capital availability 
the share repurchases were financed by available cash balances and cash from operations 
we believe that our net proceeds from operations  together with our cash balance at december   will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
in february  we acquired mazu networks  inc for approximately million of cash which was paid for from our existing cash balance 
in the future  
table of contents we may enter into other arrangements for potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  nor did we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue and receivables are not subject to significant foreign currency risk 
we do incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar and therefore are subject to volatility in cash flows due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro  australian dollar and singapore dollar 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts since 
table of contents exchange rate fluctuations have had minimal impact on our operating results and cash flows 
in addition  sales would be negatively affected if we chose to more heavily discount our product price in foreign markets to maintain competitive pricing 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and december   respectively  are held for working capital purposes and include highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market mutual funds  government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills  and other money market securities 
marketable securities of million and million at december  and december   respectively  consist of government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills  fdic backed certificates of deposit and corporate bonds and notes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the high investment quality and relatively short duration of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair market value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
the volatility in the credit markets in late through mid caused a macro shift in investments into highly liquid short term investments such as us treasury bills 
this has caused a significant decline in short term interest rates  which resulted in a significant reduction in our investment income 
in addition  the volatility in the credit markets increases the risk of write downs of investments to fair market value
