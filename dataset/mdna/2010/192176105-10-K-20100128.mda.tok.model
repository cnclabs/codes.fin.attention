overview we are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the united states and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes  preferences and price points 
as a result  we believe that we are well positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions 
our operations have primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry the sale of wholesale specialty green coffee  the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of private label coffee  and the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of our seven brands of coffee 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the level of marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  fluctuations in purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling prices of our products  and our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins 
our net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
for this reason  we have made the strategic decision to invest in measures that will increase net sales 
in february  we acquired certain assets of premier roasters  llc  including equipment and a roasting facility in la junta  colorado 
we also hired a west coast brand manager to market our s w brand and to increase sales of s w coffee to new customers 
in april  we entered into a joint venture with caruso s coffee  inc of brecksville  ohio and formed generations coffee company  llc gcc  a delaware limited liability company  which engages in the roasting  packaging and sale of private label specialty coffee products 
we own a equity interest in gcc and we are the exclusive supplier of its coffee inventory 
we believe that the joint venture will allow us to bid on the private label gourmet whole bean business which we have not been equipped to pursue from an operational standpoint in the past 
with this specialty roasting facility in place  in many cases right in the backyard of our most important wholesale and retail customers  we believe that we are in an ideal position to combine our current canned private label business with high end private label specialty whole bean business 
high end specialty whole bean coffee sells for as much as three times more per pound than the canned coffees in which we currently specialize 
as a result of these efforts  net sales increased in our specialty green coffee  private label and branded coffee business lines in both dollars and pounds sold 
in addition  the number of our customers in all three areas increased 
we closed our manufacturing operations at our brooklyn  new york location in may the majority of our processing has been moved to our colorado facility with our gcc facility in brecksville  ohio becoming more involved with our everyday coffee production 
we have leased office and warehouse space located in staten island  new york to house the corporate offices and serve as temporary storage of our branded product 
we sold the property located in brooklyn  new york in october for a pre tax gain of approximately  which enhanced our already strong cash position and liquidity 
we used the proceeds of the sale to pay down our line of credit borrowings and reduce interest expense 
although we incurred a related severance cost of  in the third quarter of fiscal year  we believe that these measures will reduce long term operating expenses  increase efficiencies and ultimately increase the profitability of our company 
in july  we entered into a three year licensing agreement with entenmann s products  inc  a subsidiary of entenmann s  inc  which is one of the nation s oldest baking companies 
the agreement gives us the exclusive rights to manufacture  market and distribute a full line of entenmann s brand coffee products throughout the united states 
we are continuing to develop not only mainstream entenmann s coffee items  but upscale flavored entenmann s products in twelve ounce valve bags as well 
these products will give the line a visible upscale image to our retailers and their customers  which we believe will be integral to the long term success of this arrangement 
our net sales are affected by the price of green coffee 
we purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the united states 
the dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries  including colombia  mexico  kenya  indonesia  brazil and uganda 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
for example  in brazil  which produces approximately of the world s green coffee  the coffee crops are historically susceptible to frost in june and july and drought in september  october and november 
however  because we purchase coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country s coffee for another in our products  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee 
accordingly  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
historically  because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers  increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net sales 
we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our cost of sales 
in addition  we acquire futures contracts with longer terms  generally three to four months  primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices 
although the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices  no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time 
in addition  we would remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts 
if the hedges that we enter into do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses  our cost of sales may increase  resulting in a decrease in profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  assets held for sale  income taxes and loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  may be impacted significantly by judgment  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss  when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
sales are reflected net of discounts and returns 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments 
if there is deterioration of our customers credit worthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used  additional allowances may be required 
for example  every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible  would decrease our operating income by approximately  for the year ended october  inventories are stated at lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions  inventories are subject to be written down to market value 
if our assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
each additional one percent of potential inventory writedown would have decreased operating income by approximately  for the year ended october  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 
accordingly  our net deferred tax asset as of october  of  may require a valuation allowance if we do not generate taxable income 
year ended october  fiscal year compared to the year ended october  fiscal year net income 
we had net income of  or per share basic and diluted  for the fiscal year ended october  compared to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in net income primarily reflects an increase in net sales and a decrease in cost of sales  which resulted in an increase in gross profit  and a  increase in other income resulting from the sale of our brooklyn  new york facility

operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended october  from  for the fiscal year ended october  due to increases in bad debt expense and officers salaries  partially offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expense 
selling and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  for the year ended october  from  for the decrease in selling and administrative expenses reflects several factors  including decreases of approximately  in shipping costs   in insurance costs  and decreases in certain other selling and administrative expenses  partially offset by increases of  in contract labor costs and  in entenmann s setup costs 
shipping costs decreased due to increased sales to our large green coffee customers who pay the shipping expenses for product they purchase from us  as well as  reduced fuel surcharges as a result of the lower cost of heating oil and crude oil during fiscal year the decrease in insurance cost was associated with the closing of our brooklyn  new york facility 
the increase in contract labor costs reflected increased production in our ohio facility which produces our caf caribe and food service items 
the increase in the entenmann s slotting costs reflected marketplace expansion of these products 
other income

at october   the outstanding balance on our line of credit was  compared to  at october  total stockholders equity increased due to an increase in retained earnings as a result of our net income for fiscal year on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement with sterling national bank sterling for a new credit facility to provide for our working capital requirements and we terminated the  line of credit we previously had under a financing agreement with merrill lynch business financial services inc the new credit facility is a revolving  line of credit and the company can draw on the line at an amount up to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed  the credit facility is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate currently plus

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices as further described below 
interest rate risks 
we are subject to market risk from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at october   our debt consisted of  of variable rate debt under our revolving line of credit 
our line of credit provides for a maximum of  and is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate currently plus 
this loan is secured by tangible and intangible assets of the company 
commodity price risks 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
historically  we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts generally with terms of two months or less primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices  as further explained in note of the notes to financial statements in this report 
in addition  during the latter half of fiscal  we began to acquire futures contracts with longer terms generally three to four months primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee 
the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices although we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time or remain at higher levels  preventing us from obtaining inventory at favorable prices 
we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers  thereby maintaining our gross profits 
however  we cannot predict whether we will be able to pass inventory price increases through to our customers in the future 
we believe our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales  but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while minimizing margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices 
at october   the company held futures contracts for the purchase of  pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of per pound 
the fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was per pound at that date 
at october   the company did not hold any future contracts
