hershey trust company  as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the milton hershey school trust or the trust maintains voting control over the hershey company 
historically  the milton hershey school trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy  nor had it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management 
however  in october  the chairman of the board of the milton hershey school trust issued a statement indicating that the trust continues to be guided by two key principles first  that  in its role as controlling stockholder of the company  it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and  second  that the long term prosperity of the company requires the board of directors of the company and its management to build on its strong us position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth 
he further stated that the milton hershey school trust had communicated to the company s board that the trust was not satisfied with the company s results and that  as a result  the trust was actively engaged in an ongoing process  the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous company board focus on resolving the company s current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies 
in that release  the trust board chairman reiterated the trust s longstanding position that the company board  and not the trust board  is solely responsible and accountable for the company s management and performance 
arnold g 
langbo and charles b 
strauss resigned from the board of directors of the company effective august   following a decision by the board of directors to establish a finance and risk management committee that also delegated to such committee responsibilities with respect to reviewing and monitoring the company s annual plan and certain strategic matters including but not limited to acquisitions and dispositions 
messrs 
langbo and strauss decided to resign from the board of directors based on their views  expressed before the committee was established  that retaining responsibility for these matters with the board of directors as a whole was a better corporate governance structure for the company 
on november  we announced that all of the members of our board of directors had resigned except for richard h 
lenny  who was at that time our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  david j 
west  who was at that time president of the company and currently serves as our president and chief executive officer  and robert f 
cavanaugh  who is also a member of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers governing body of milton hershey school 
in addition  we announced that the milton hershey school trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the by laws of the company to allow the company s stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our board of directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors  expanded the size of our board of directors from directors to directors  and appointed new directors  including two who are also members of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers of milton hershey school 
the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june  but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september after terminating the sale process  the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general 
subsequently  pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company 
the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations 
this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
in december  our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement rights agreement 
the milton hershey school trust supported the rights agreement 
this action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the hershey company 
under the rights agreement  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right right for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  the rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends 
the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect  will not affect reported earnings per share  is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our common stock is traded

registration statements in may  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities 
this registration statement was effective immediately upon filing under securities and exchange commission regulations governing well known seasoned issuers the wksi registration statement 
this wksi registration statement was filed to replace a may wksi registration statement which expired in may in march  we issued million of notes due april  the notes were issued under the wksi registration statement 
proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the wksi registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements 
these may include reducing existing borrowings  financing capital additions  funding contributions to our pension plans  future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows payments due by year in thousands of dollars contractual obligations thereafter total unconditional purchase obligations non cancelable operating leases long term debt total obligations in entering into contractual obligations  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution  conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties 
our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 
purchase obligations we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials 
these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third party brokers and dealers 
these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations 
total obligations for each year presented above  consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december  the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods 
we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods 
increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts 
this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december  and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts 
taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 
asset retirement obligations we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities 
our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations 
current regulations require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished 
we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities 
we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and  therefore  sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos 
as of december   certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale 
we are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which have not been reflected in our current estimates 
income tax obligations we base our deferred income taxes  accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income  statutory tax rates  the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws 
we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in assessments of additional tax 
we maintain reserves for such assessments 
we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 
assessments of additional tax require cash payments 
we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments 
the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 
accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments we use certain derivative instruments  from time to time  including interest rate swaps  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options  and commodities futures and options contracts  to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures  respectively 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures 
these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we enter into commodities futures and options contracts for varying periods 
these futures and options contracts are intended to be  and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases  energy requirements and transportation costs 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
in entering into these contracts  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution  conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties 
we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 
accounting policies associated with derivative instruments we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income 
we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  if any  must be recognized currently in earnings 
fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet 
for fair value hedges  our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item 
the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 
as of december   we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts and options and commodities futures and options contracts  as cash flow hedges 
additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with long term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december  note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 
long term debt the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long term debt  including the current portion  as of december  we determined the fair value of long term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 
maturity date thereafter total fair value in thousands of dollars except for rates long term debt interest rate we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december  interest rate swaps in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure  from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in march  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated million of term financing expected to be executed during to repay million of notes maturing in september the weighted average fixed rate on the forward starting swap agreements was 
the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a net asset of million as of december  our risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates 
as of december   the potential net loss associated with interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in interest rates of ten percent was approximately million 
for more information see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of december  we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 
foreign exchange forward contracts and options we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment  raw materials and finished goods 
we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states 
these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements 
we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from to months 
foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments 
we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives 
the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows december  contract amount primary currencies contract amount primary currencies in millions of dollars foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies euros swiss francs euros swiss francs mexican pesos foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies canadian dollars canadian dollars australian dollars we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period 
we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms  adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 
a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows december  in millions of dollars fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts  net liability asset potential net loss associated with foreign exchange forward contracts resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in market rates of ten percent our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
commodities price risk management and futures contracts our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products  sugar  dairy products  peanuts and almonds 
the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors 
these factors include commodity market fluctuations  currency exchange rates  imbalances between supply and demand  the effect of weather on crop yield  speculative influences  trade agreements among producing and consuming nations  political unrest in producing countries  and changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies 
we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products  sugar  corn sweeteners  natural gas  fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements 
we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for to months 
however  the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and  therefore  it is not possible to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts to extend coverage for longer periods of time 
we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs 
our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs  but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 
during  the average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with  and traded in a range between and per pound  based on the prices of futures contracts traded on the intercontinentalexchange 
cocoa futures prices during traded at prices which were near year highs 
the significant increase in cocoa futures prices reflected the impact of a weakening us dollar as compared with other currencies  and an increase in asset allocation into commodity based investments by various hedge funds 
during  dairy prices started the year near 
per pound and dropped to approximately 
per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis 
prices were weak in the face of strong production of milk and dairy products  and sluggish demand worldwide 
our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 
we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges 
these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses 
we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income 
the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials  energy requirements and transportation costs 
futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 
commodity position sensitivity analysis the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of  based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year 
our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities 
inventories  priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations 
we define a loss  for purposes of determining market risk  as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement 
the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices  including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 
for the years ended december  fair value market risk hypothetical change fair value market risk hypothetical change in millions of dollars highest long position lowest long position average position long the increase in fair values from to primarily reflected higher prices  slightly offset by a decrease in net commodity positions 
the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 
use of estimates and other critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in various instances  gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following accounts receivable trade accrued liabilities pension and other post retirement benefits plans goodwill and other intangible assets commodities futures contracts management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note  summary of significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable trade in the normal course of business  we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions 
our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company  inc  one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores  drug stores  wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers 
mclane company  inc accounted for approximately of our total accounts receivable as of december  as of december   no other customer accounted for more than of our total accounts receivable 
we believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 
accounts receivable trade  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  were net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on historical trends  and evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we monitor the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable  assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
estimates with regard to the collectability of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 
information on our accounts receivable trade  related expenses and assumptions is as follows for the three year period in millions of dollars  except percents average expense for potential uncollectible accounts average write offs of uncollectible accounts allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable we recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling  marketing and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
if we made reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectability of accounts receivable  our annual provision could change within the following range a reduction in expense of approximately million  and an increase in expense of approximately million 
changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
accrued liabilities accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 
liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition 
information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars promotional costs we determine the amount of the accrued liability by analysis of programs offered  historical trends  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  sales and payment trends  and experience with payment patterns associated with similar  previously offered programs 
the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation  particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range a reduction in costs of approximately million  and an increase in costs of approximately million 
changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes 
over the three year period ended december   actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 
changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products at the time of sale  we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future 
the estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales 
a related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends  seasonal timing and sales patterns  and product movement at retail 
estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand  the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs 
over the three year period ended december   costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately of gross sales 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from million to million 
over the three year period ended december   actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than approximately 
reasonably possible near term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
pension and other post retirement benefits plans overview we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans 
the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees 
these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january  we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans  as well as recent court cases  for any impact on our plans 
we also sponsor primary post retirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually  and the life insurance plan is non contributory 
we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of and federal income tax laws 
beginning january   we complied with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of we fund non domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans 
we broadly diversify our pension plan assets  consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities 
short term and long term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations 
these calculations consider payroll and employee data  including age and years of service  along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements 
we take into consideration long term projections with regard to economic conditions  including interest rates  return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
with regard to liabilities associated with post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance  we take into consideration the long term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits 
we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption asset return assumption for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when long term asset return projections demonstrate that need 
an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans is required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for any other post retirement benefit plan  such as a retiree health care plan  the benefit obligation is the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position 
disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition asset or obligation 
pension plans our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net periodic pension benefit costs income assumptions average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation asset return assumptions net periodic pension benefit costs we recorded net periodic pension benefit expense of million in the increase from was primarily due to the significant decline in the value of pension assets during reflecting volatility and deterioration in financial market and economic conditions 
we recorded net periodic pension benefit income in primarily due to the modifications announced in october which reduced future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan  the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december  our periodic pension benefit costs in will be approximately million lower due to the higher actual return on pension assets in actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations 
we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of of a respective plan s projected benefit obligation  or the fair market value of assets  if greater 
the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for is million 
the recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was million 
projections beyond are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 
average discount rate assumption net periodic benefit costs income the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations 
in order to estimate this rate for and  a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost income a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit expense by million 
average discount rate assumption benefit obligations the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost income as described above 
we reduced our discount rate assumption due to the declining interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
asset return assumptions we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit costs income on the fair market value of pension plan assets 
to determine the expected return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets 
the historical geometric average return over the years prior to december  was approximately 
the actual return on assets was as follows for the years ended december  actual return loss on assets the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost income a one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit expense by million 
our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class 
the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows asset class allocation range equity securities debt securities cash and certain other investments as of december   actual allocations were within the specified ranges 
we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes 
as of december  and  the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index 
for and  minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material 
however  we made contributions of million in and million in to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our non qualified pension plans 
these contributions were fully tax deductible 
a one percentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans 
for  there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and planned voluntary funding of our pension plans in is not material 
post retirement benefit plans other post retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net periodic other post retirement benefit cost assumptions average discount rate assumption the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post retirement benefit cost a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic other post retirement benefit cost by 
million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic other post retirement benefit cost by million 
other post retirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows december  in millions of dollars other post retirement benefit obligation assumptions benefit obligations discount rate assumption a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill  impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 
we use a two step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record 
in the second step  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets 
we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 
the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 
we perform annual impairment tests of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
we determined than none of our goodwill was impaired as of december  the fair value of our godrej hershey ltd 
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
as of december   the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was approximately million 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on the past performance of the reporting unit as well as the projections incorporated in our current operating plans 
significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with sales growth  profitability  and related cash flows  along with cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending 
the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting unit 
we also considered assumptions that market participants may use 
by their nature  these projections and assumptions are uncertain 
potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the unavailability of raw or packaging materials or significant cost increases  pricing constraints and possible disruptions to our supply chain 
the fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer related intangible assets  patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions 
we amortize customer related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives 
the useful lives of existing trademarks were determined to be indefinite and  therefore  we do not amortize them 
we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a relief from royalty payments methodology 
this approach involves two steps 
in the first step  we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark 
in the second step  we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 
we perform annual impairment tests of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
we determined that none of our other intangible assets was impaired as of december  in december  we recorded total non cash impairment charges of million 
we determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks  primarily the mauna loa brand  exceeded their estimated fair value due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates 
commodities futures and options contracts we use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases  provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations 
additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net after tax gains on cash flow hedging derivatives reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income hedge ineffectiveness gains losses recognized in cost of sales  before tax we reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in cost of sales 
no gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur 
we recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment 
the amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts and options  and commodities futures and options contracts  expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next months was approximately million after tax as of december  this amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 
outlook the outlook section contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
refer to risk factors beginning on page for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 
we expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging in in this environment  we will continue to build our business by focusing on a consumer driven approach to core brand investment and new product innovation in north america  along with investments in our strategic international businesses 
we expect to increase advertising investment by to behind our core brands and new product introductions 
we will also continue to invest in consumer insights  in store selling  merchandising and programming to drive profitable growth for both our company and our customers 
we expect our cost structure to remain at elevated levels in key commodity markets remain volatile and prices for many commodities are near multi year highs 
we have good visibility into our full year cost structure for we also expect to continue to achieve productivity and efficiency improvements  along with price realization in  resulting in modestly enhanced margins 
for  we expect to achieve net sales growth within our long term objective of to and adjusted earnings per share diluted growth within our long term objective of to 
outlook for global supply chain transformation program total pre tax charges and non recurring project implementation costs over the last three years for the gsct were million 
the gsct was essentially complete as of december  however  the current trends of employee lump sum withdrawals from the defined benefit pension plans could result in additional non cash pension settlement losses of million to million in in addition  the manufacturing facilities in naugatuck  connecticut  reading  pennsylvania  and smiths falls  ontario have been closed and are being held for sale 
actual proceeds from the sale of these facilities could differ from expected proceeds which could cause additional charges or credits in subsequent events in may  the fasb issued a new standard effective for both interim and annual financial statements ending after june  it establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued
