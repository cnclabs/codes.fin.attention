our goal is to ensure that all users can use decision making information in their day to day activities  opening up completely new avenues for improving corporate performance 
december  in thousands financial summary total revenues total operating expenses income from operations operating margins despite the recent global recession  we have achieved consistent profitability and positive cash flows in the recent years  including fiscal year we achieved these results not only through our solid execution  leading technology and strong customer relationships  but also because of our commitment to operating efficiencies which have resulted in significant reductions to our operating expenses  as we aligned our business to weather a turbulent and unpredictable macro economic environment 
as a result of these reductions in operating expenses  we have seen improvements to our operating margins in fiscal year nevertheless  our business model and longer term financial results are not immune to a sustained economic downturn 
the financial turmoil and economic uncertainty over the last two years has caused some of our customers to postpone investments and purchase decisions  decrease their spending or delay payments to us 
during fiscal year we saw increasing pressures on our customers information technology budgets  and therefore our customers sought more flexibility in the timing of purchases 
facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses  some of our customers are waiting to purchase our products and are increasingly seeking purchasing terms and conditions that are less favorable to us 
this trend partially contributed to lower license revenues for fiscal year and fiscal year we have also seen a similar impact on our consulting business in the recent years 
if the financial turmoil and economic uncertainty continue and cause further customer 
table of contents bankruptcies or consolidation among our customers  our year over year revenue and operating income results could be adversely affected 
we continue to monitor market conditions and may make adjustments to our business in order to reduce the adverse impact that the prolonged economic downturn could have on our business 
we expect to continue to explore both organic and inorganic growth opportunities 
in particular  we may acquire companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic  operational and financial performance of our business 
we believe that the combination of our solid financials  leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us successfully execute our strategies 
business model we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
fiscal year the overall decrease in total revenues was mainly driven by lower professional services and license sales which decreased by and over the same period last year  respectively  as we continue facing a challenging macro economic environment  especially in the international markets 
these negative conditions have forced customers to either delay purchases or find solutions to increase optimal efficiencies using infrastructure server environments 
during fiscal year the or approximately million decrease in professional services revenues was mainly due to a weak macro economic environment which is causing some customers to either delay projects or cancel engagements 
we believe some customers are opting to use in house resources to complete previously outsourced projects 
another factor contributing to the decrease in the professional services revenues is the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
our maintenance revenues remained steady at million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year nevertheless  our performance under this category was adversely affected by an increase in the number of licensees of certain of our legacy products that declined to renew their maintenance contracts 
consequently  in fiscal year we restructured our maintenance renewal group to allow for a stronger focus on maintenance renewal follow up 
during the second half of fiscal year and in response to the weak macro economic conditions  we implemented a restructuring plan which resulted in the elimination of positions held by actuate employees primarily in north america  the consolidation of facilities  and the write off of fixed assets located at facilities that had been vacated 
we implemented a second restructuring in the second half of fiscal year which resulted in the elimination of positions held by actuate employees primarily in north america and europe 
these cost cutting measures have primarily been the force behind the or million reduction in operating expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year consequently  our operating margins have improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in the fully diluted earnings per share in fiscal year over the same period last year was primarily attributed to these reductions in our operating expenses as discussed above and the decrease in our diluted share count 
this decrease in share count was mainly due to the tender offer completed in december of resulting in the repurchase of approximately million shares 
as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our total revenues for fiscal year compared to last year was negatively impacted by approximately million while our operating expenses decreased by approximately million 

table of contents a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions have adversely impacted the financial services industry throughout fiscal year and fiscal year if this trend continues  it will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
on february  we completed the acquisition of xenos  inc xenos a publicly traded company headquartered in ontario  canada  and a market leading provider of high performance software solutions 
the company s solutions  based on the scalable xenos enterprise server and its components  process  extract  transform  repurpose and personalize high volumes of data and documents for storage  real time access  epresentment  printing and delivery in numerous formats across multiple channels 
we intend to enhance our current product offering by adding xenos s products and technology to our existing product line 
the acquisition of xenos was accomplished via a tender offer  at a purchase price of approximately canadian dollar cad per share or cad million 
the transaction was entirely settled by cash  was unanimously approved by actuate and xenos boards of directors on december   and reflects an enterprise value of xenos of approximately cad million  net of xenos cash balance 
the transaction resulted in actuate acquiring of xenos outstanding shares on february  the shares acquired by us are sufficient to permit us to acquire all remaining shares not tendered which we expect to complete in the first quarter of fiscal year the acquisition was valued at approximately cad million and was funded using a combination of cash reserves and borrowings available under our existing credit facility with wells fargo foothill wff totaling million 
we also incurred approximately  in direct costs related to the acquisition as of december  and expect to incur additional direct costs related to the acquisition 
these costs could include costs associated with restructuring of our operations 
our total headcount at the end of fiscal year was compared to employees at the end of last year 
at february   xenos had approximately employees 
fiscal year a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions starting in late fiscal year have adversely impacted the financial services industry throughout fiscal year if this trend continues into  it will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal year  we expect three additional trends to continue that would have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly if at all in the fiscal year particularly among financial services companies in the united states 
second  corporations are reluctant to buy software from new vendors and we continue to witness corporations consolidating their business intelligence  rich internet application and performance management software purchases with fewer suppliers 
finally  we expect to experience vigorous competition in the rich internet applications market 
several of our competitors have released products that are marketed to be directly competitive with our rich information applications offerings 
the existence of these competitive products may require additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which could result in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the rich internet applications market will be vigorous in the near future 

table of contents for fiscal year  we will continue to pursue the strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth that we began introducing in fiscal year as well as an initiative related to performance management  which we introduced in fiscal year these initiatives are as follows selling to it management we are re focusing our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
solution selling to line of business management we are creating performance management applications and software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these offerings are in the areas of performance management and customer self service reporting 
we hope these initiatives will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
investing in birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in creating a new open source business intelligence and reporting tool  known as birt 
we hope that birt will eventually become widely adopted by java developers and will create demand for our other commercially available products 
the birt project is a long term initiative 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we are continuing to focus on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
we anticipate a negative impact of the ongoing credit crunch on the financial services sector in however  we believe that once the short term issues in financial services are resolved  the industry will once again lead in the adoption of rich information applications both inside and outside the firewall 
delivering a highly differentiated performance management offering we have combined actuate birt performance scorecard applications and actuate s rich information application ready platform to provide capabilities for distributing accountability throughout the enterprise 
in addition to the above  in fiscal year we will initiate strategies involving the recent acquisition of xenos group 
as part of actuate s product portfolio  the xenos product family will continue to be fully supported and drive value for customers as it does in many applications today 
the planned integration will enable new and existing customers to leverage both xenos and actuate technologies to efficiently address new challenges and deliver higher value 
we plan to leverage actuate s birt technology and rich information application platform to provide rich  interactive delivery and analysis of information sourced from documents and print streams accessed by xenos products 
the combined technologies will enable agile response to business demands without reworking existing infrastructure 
the integration of xenos product capabilities into actuate s enterprise class  highly scalable birt iserver product line will provide a new deployment option 
this integration will enhance the existing xenos enterprise server product that provides a unified  easy to manage platform for applications looking to integrate existing documents and print streams with the next generation information delivery and business intelligence capabilities provided by actuate s flagship birt iserver and birt technology 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  restructuring and integration costs  and the impairment of goodwill  have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
actuate generates revenues from the sales of software licenses and related services 
the company receives software license revenues from licensing its products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers oems 
the company receives service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that actuate performs for customers 
actuate recognizes revenues in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa on revenue recognition 
for sales to end user customers  actuate recognizes license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties or a definitive agreement has been received from the customer  the product has been physically shipped or electronically made available  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectability is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of sales to end users is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
actuate has not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for its licenses 
therefore  the company recognizes revenues from arrangements with multiple elements involving software licenses under the residual method which means the full fair value is allocated to the undelivered elements while the remaining value of the arrangement is allocated to the delivered elements 
if the license agreement contains payment terms that would indicate that the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as the payments become due and payable  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
actuate enters into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically give such distributors and resellers the right to distribute its products to end users headquartered in specified territories 
actuate recognizes license revenues from arrangements with us resellers and distributors when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the reseller or distributor  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
actuate recognizes license revenues from arrangements with international resellers and distributors upon receipt of evidence of sell through and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if it is not practical to obtain evidence of sell through  the company defers revenues until the end user has been identified and cash has been received 
in some instances there is a timing difference between when a reseller completes its sale to the end user and the period in which actuate receives the documentation required for revenue recognition 

table of contents actuate also enters into oem arrangements that provide for license fees based on the bundling or embedding of its products with the oem s products 
these arrangements generally provide for fixed  irrevocable royalty payments 
actuate recognizes license fee revenues from us and international oem arrangements when a license agreement has been executed by both parties  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectability is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
the company typically establishes vendor specific objective evidence of fair value under a bell shaped curve approach 
however  for certain types of license transactions  including oem and site licenses  the company uses a stated maintenance renewal approach 
credit worthiness and collectability for end users are assessed based on payment history and current credit profile 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenues are deferred and recognized upon cash receipt 
actuate recognizes maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and unspecified product updates  ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to standard implementation and configuration 
training revenues are generated from classes offered at the company s headquarters and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and training services are typically recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both license and service elements  the license fee is typically recognized on delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the product and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also cease recognizing future revenues on any outstanding domestic maintenance renewal invoices which are older than days past due 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the service period for awards that are expected to vest based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
we calculate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
the use of a black scholes merton model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected forfeiture rate 
as a result  the future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation 
table of contents expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of the expected term of options granted is derived from historical share option exercise experience 
in the future  we may change our estimate of the expected term  which would impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 
income taxes 
we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we also apply a two step approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will record in the financial statements before actually preparing and filing the tax returns 
our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 
changes in our business  tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  and developments in current and future tax audits  could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carry forwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified 
based on the analysis of positive and negative factors noted above  we have no valuation allowance against deferred tax assets generated in the company s us jurisdiction 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions with a history of losses and a partial valuation allowance in foreign jurisdictions where operating results beyond a certain time frame are less reliable 
if  in the future  we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 
we only recognize an income tax expense or benefit with respect to uncertain tax positions in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
to make this judgment  we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws  regulations and administrative practices 
if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be 
table of contents recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes 
to determine if a tax position is effectively settled  we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed 
we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the months after each fiscal year end 
these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements 
we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
accrual for restructuring charges 
we incurred certain restructuring charges that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities that we periodically update based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
these estimates of sublease income were not significant in fiscal years and valuation of goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that there was no impairment

we attribute a significant portion of the decline in our revenues to our professional services business  which decreased during fiscal year compared to the prior year 
this decrease was mainly due to a weak macro economic environment which is causing some customers to either delay their projects or cancel their engagements 
we believe some customers are opting to use in house resources to complete previously outsourced projects 
another factor contributing to the decrease in the professional services revenues is the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
our birt related business increased in fiscal year and is expected to grow in fiscal year our license revenues have decreased in fiscal year primarily due to the unfavorable macro economic conditions that continue to adversely impact the financial services industry  a key component of actuate s customer portfolio

this decrease in international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year compared to the same period last year was primarily due to challenging macro economic environments in europe and asia 
approximately million of the decrease in international revenues was due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
for fiscal year we managed to close approximately transactions in excess of  compared to in fiscal year in addition  we recognized license revenue of million or more on transactions during fiscal year compared to transactions in fiscal year the number of orders greater than million has historically ranged from none to three per quarter 
we do not expect to rely on any one customer for our future business 
the decrease in total revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to lower demand for our products as a result of unfavorable economic conditions that began in late fiscal year and continue to adversely impact the financial services industry  a key component of our customer portfolio 
as a result  license sales experienced a decline of approximately over fiscal year in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  we experienced declines in license sales across most of our sales regions  including or approximately million in north america and or approximately million outside north america 
professional services revenues decreased and were primarily the result of the continued increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not result in professional service revenues to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
our birt related business increased over the same period in fiscal year these decreases in license and consulting revenues were partially offset by an or million increase in maintenance and support revenues in fiscal year over the same period in fiscal year of this increase in maintenance and support revenues  the majority was attributable to normal growth in support for our installed base

despite weakness in license sales  our maintenance renewal revenues remained stable in fiscal year as we secured several large compliance deals that included a back maintenance component 
also  in fiscal year we restructured our maintenance renewal group to allow for a stronger focus on maintenance renewal follow up 
nevertheless  our revenue growth under this category was adversely affected in fiscal year by increases in declines for certain of our legacy products 
the increase in services revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year was driven by the growth in our maintenance and support revenues  which continued to increase in fiscal year the fourth quarter of included an unusually large million maintenance catch up transaction 
excluding this one time transaction for back maintenance  fiscal year maintenance revenue increased by over fiscal year the increase in the installed base was evidenced by the fact that in fiscal year we were supporting a large percentage of the million in licenses sold in fiscal year  while our maintenance declination rate had remained consistent in fiscal year as we continued to experience steady renewal rates from our existing customers

for the same period last year  north america accounted for approximately of the total services revenue while the europe and asia pacific regions accounted for and of the total services revenues  respectively 
services margins improved from in fiscal year  to in fiscal year this improvement was mostly the result of the shift in product mix  which reflected a higher percentage of maintenance and support revenue in the fiscal year than in fiscal year maintenance and support typically carries a higher margin than professional services 
also  the lower professional services revenues resulted in cost reductions in our professional services group that were implemented during the second half of fiscal year and throughout fiscal year the decrease in professional services revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products

the decrease in cost of services for fiscal year  compared to the prior year  was primarily due to the decrease in consulting revenues as demand for actuate s professional services engagements continued to decrease during fiscal year in response to this decrease in services engagement opportunities  we reduced our cost structure during the second half of fiscal year and continued these reductions throughout fiscal year consequently  we reduced our professional consulting headcount by approximately or employees from at the end of fiscal year to employees at end of fiscal year as a result of these reductions  employee compensation and travel costs decreased by approximately million during fiscal year third party consulting fees also decreased by approximately million in fiscal year compared to the same period last year 
this was a direct result of an intentional reduction in the use of external contractors to staff engagements 
finally  during fiscal year internal costs allocated to the services group decreased by approximately million  primarily due to a decrease in consulting revenues and reduced headcount in the services group 

table of contents the decrease in cost of services in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily driven by a decrease in our consulting headcount which consequently resulted in reductions in employee salaries  associated benefits and employee travel costs totaling approximately million 
this decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in professional services revenues caused by the adoption of birt based projects by our customers and the movement of previously outsourced projects in house 
birt based projects do not generate professional service revenues to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
we also realized reductions in facilities related charges of approximately  due partially to the closure of our service facility in iselin  new jersey in the second half of fiscal year these reductions were offset by an approximately  increase in third party consulting fees as demand for actuate s professional services engagements during the first half of fiscal year exceeded the supply of in house consultants 
we currently expect cost of services to increase in fiscal year in line with the anticipated increase in service revenues associated with our acquisition of xenos in february excluding the acquisition of xenos  we expect our cost of services expenses as a percentage of total services revenues to be in the range of to of total services revenues for fiscal year sales and marketing year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  stock based compensation  promotional expenses  travel  entertainment and facility costs 
for fiscal year  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to reductions in employee related expenses 
salaries  sales commissions  and stock based compensation and employee travel combined to account for approximately million of the decrease in fiscal year expenses 
these reductions were mostly due to the drop in license revenues  which translated into lower sales commissions 
our sales and marketing headcount also decreased by  or employees  from at the end of fiscal year to at the end of fiscal year our lower headcount also resulted in a reduction in recruiting fees of approximately  we also continued our ongoing efforts to streamline our processes and lower expenses 
because of this  our annual corporate kickoff and sales training expenses were significantly lower in the current fiscal year as compared to fiscal year marketing programs decreased by approximately  in fiscal year as compared to the same period last year as we combined the actuate international user conference aiuc with our annual sales kick off events into one 
finally  we reversed approximately  in legal fees as a result of a case settlement related to the fiscal year employee termination in one our european sales divisions 
for fiscal year  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to decreases in salaries  sales commissions and employee travel of approximately million due to lower software sales and reductions in headcount 
total sales and marketing headcount decreased from at december  to at december  these decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately million in marketing expenses driven by webinars  direct marketing  and tradeshows 
in fiscal year  we also recorded approximately  in accrued legal fees related to a one time employee termination charge as a result of the termination of a sales employee in our european division 

table of contents we currently expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year primarily due to our recent acquisition of xenos in february excluding the acquisition of xenos  we expect our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues to be in the range of to of total revenues for fiscal year research and development year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal year was primarily attributed to employee compensation and related costs 
total worldwide research and development headcount decreased by employees from at the end of fiscal year to at the end of fiscal year also  during fiscal year  we shifted a portion of our research and development headcount away from north america where employee costs are higher and into china  where employee costs are significantly lower 
the benefit of this shift was fully realized in fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  was attributed to employee compensation and related costs driven mainly by annual salary adjustments and stock compensation expense 
our headcount remained comparable at at the end of fiscal year compared to at the end of fiscal year this increase in employee compensation expense was partially offset by decreases in facilities related charges due partially to the consolidation of our vienna  virginia facilities into one location and lower fees paid to external contractors 
we believe that continued investments in technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve  and we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year due to our recent acquisition of xenos in february of excluding the acquisition of xenos  we expect our research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues to be in the range of to for fiscal year general and administrative year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  stock based compensation and related costs in finance  human resources  legal and tax functions  as well as audit and legal fees and bad debt expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year 
table of contents are primarily due to increased legal fees of approximately million due mostly to contract compliance matters pursued during the year 
we also incurred approximately  of legal fees associated with the acquisition of xenos which were mostly incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year these increases were partially offset by a reduction of approximately  in employee compensation  benefits and recruiting fees due to reduced headcount which decreased from at fiscal year to at the end of fiscal year we also benefited from a business tax refund of approximately  in china during the year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was mainly due to increased salaries and stock based compensation expense of approximately million due primarily to annual salary adjustments and a increase in headcount over the same period last year 
we also experienced increases in legal and corporate advisory fees totaling approximately  in fiscal year related to advice regarding strategic alternatives 
these increases were partially offset by approximately  in lower general accounting  tax and professional consulting services driven by lower sox compliance costs 
in addition  in fiscal year  we experienced approximately  lower costs for strategic consulting services in support of our birt initiative 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year due to our recent acquisition of xenos in february of and contract compliance matters

these annual impairment tests have not resulted in an impairment of recorded goodwill in fiscal year  or the amortization expense is lower in fiscal year as some intangibles related to our prior acquisitions were fully amortized at the end fiscal year for each year ended december  and we recorded  for the amortization of other purchased intangibles 
these costs represent the amortization of the intangibles associated with the acquisition of performancesoft on a straight line basis 
we expect the estimated amortization expense related to other purchased intangible assets to increase in future periods due to the acquisition of xenos in the february of 
table of contents restructuring charges year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue historically  restructuring charges have included costs associated with reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities that we periodically update based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
during the first half of fiscal year we incurred  in legal fees related to a previous restructuring which involved the terminations of former employees in one of our european subsidiaries 
we also incurred approximately  in additional charges related to prior facility closures in north america 
these charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities that we periodically update based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
during the second half of fiscal year we implemented restructuring actions that resulted in aggregate charges of  and elimination of positions worldwide  across all levels within the sales organization 
during the second half of fiscal year we also recorded a  reduction to our idle facilities reserves due to a change in the estimated sublease income for the vienna  virginia facility and true ups of operating expenses associated with our idle south san francisco facility 
during the first half of fiscal year  we recorded facility related restructuring charges totaling  these charges primarily related to lease exit costs associated with our south san francisco facility  the closure of one of the three floors in our toronto  canada facility and the consolidation of our vienna  virginia facilities into one location 
we also incurred approximately  in legal fees related to a previous restructuring which involved the terminations of former employees in one of our european subsidiaries 
in order to size the operations to meet the expected business and economic environment  we also implemented a restructuring plan during the second half of fiscal year to eliminate positions held by actuate employees primarily in north america 
this restructuring impacted all functional areas 
the reduction in force was completed in fiscal year the restructuring plan also resulted in the recognition of costs related to the consolidation of facilities  the cancellation of certain contracts and the write off of fixed assets located at facilities that have been vacated

interest income and other income  net dollars in thousands year ended december  to to change change change change interest income foreign exchange loss other income  net total interest income and other income  net interest expense interest and other income  net  is comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments  foreign currency exchange gains and losses  interest expense incurred on our debt facility  as well as other various charges or income which are not derived from our normal operations 
for the year ended december   the decrease in interest income was due to an overall decrease in interest rates and lower average cash balances 
the rate of return on our investment portfolio dropped significantly in although cash and investments balance was higher at the end fiscal year it was lower on average during the span of the year 
this is because we used million of cash to pay for the tender offer at the end fiscal year and spent another million on share buybacks during the year 
during fiscal year  we experienced foreign exchange losses due primarily to continued devaluation of the british pound  the 
table of contents euro and the us dollar currency balances held by our swiss subsidiary against the swiss franc 
the revaluation of these currency amounts held in switzerland to swiss francs is a required procedure in consolidating and reporting the financial results of our european operations 
we also recorded interest expense totaling approximately million in fiscal year on the utilized portion of our credit facility with wff  which was signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we also recorded unused line fees and amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately  for the year ended december   the decrease in interest income was due primarily to a lower weighted average interest rate on our investments resulting in a decrease in interest income 
we incurred foreign exchange losses that were primarily the result of sharp devaluations of the british pound  the euro and the us dollar currencies held by our swiss subsidiary against the swiss franc mainly during the first half of fiscal year the revaluation of these currency amounts held in switzerland to swiss francs is a required procedure in consolidating and reporting the financial results of our european operations 
we expect interest and other income to decrease in fiscal year due to the fact that a significant cash outlay was required to close our acquisition of xenos in february we also expect to incur higher interest charges under the credit facility with wff as an additional million was drawn down in the first quarter of fiscal year to fund the acquisition of xenos 
provision for benefit from income taxes year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands the provision in income taxes represents primarily federal  state and foreign taxes as adjusted for the impact of operating losses utilized  income tax credits benefited and the reversal or establishment of reserves 
the provision for income taxes of million  the benefit for income taxes of million and the benefit for income taxes of  is based on pretax income of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in the tax provision in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the significant increase in us profit before tax 
the increase in the benefit for income taxes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the tax benefit expected on the us income tax returns for write off of the investment in and specific loans related to the tax liquidation of a foreign subsidiary 
additionally  there was a decrease in the provision for income taxes due to a million and million benefit from the decrease in the valuation allowance in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the decrease in the valuation allowance in fiscal year was the result of changes to our foreign deferred tax assets due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign tax rates and the expected utilization of specific deferred tax assets 
without the write off from the liquidation of the foreign subsidiary or the benefit from the decrease in the valuation allowance  there would have been an increase in the provision for income taxes in fiscal year the decrease in the valuation allowance in fiscal year was the result of management s determination that it was more likely than not that the deferred assets would be realized after weighing the applicable positive and negative evidence 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 
the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year this data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows

the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue  and changes in operating assets driven by timing differences in prepaid expenses and other current assets and liabilities 
the increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to several transactions that were recorded and billed at the end of fiscal year as well as several multi year maintenance renewal billings for which we were able to obtain customer commitment and invoice in advance 
despite an economic downturn  our maintenance revenues have remained steady and have comprised over of our total revenues in fiscal year based on these factors  we believe that future proceeds from the maintenance renewals will be the primary source of our operating cash flows 
we expect cash provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of our billings and collections  our operating results  the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used to fund any future acquisitions 
accounts receivable  net december  december  change change in order to fund our on going operations  we rely heavily on timely collections of our accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities 
based on the latest fiscal quarter  our dso was days at december  and days for the same period last year 
the increase in dso along with an increase in accounts receivable balance primarily relates to several transactions recorded and billed at the end of fiscal year as well as a stronger focus on maintenance renewal follow up by our maintenance renewal group that resulted in acceleration of billings at the 
table of contents end of fiscal year we also continue to closely monitor the credit quality and payment history of our existing and new customers to better identify and minimize  in advance  the risk of our customers potential inability to make required payments 
the primary uses of cash from operations consist of salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to our employees 
we pay our employees on a semi monthly basis and we generally pay our vendors within one month from receiving an invoice for services rendered

as of december   we remained contractually committed to million in net operating lease obligations related to our worldwide facilities 
the majority of these commitments are due within the next five years 
cash flows from investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of purchases  maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities 
we also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to cash provided of million for the same period last year 
the decrease in cash used primarily relates to the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities 
our capital expenditures for the past two years have primarily consisted of leasehold improvements related to our headquarter facility in san mateo  california and software costs associated with our internal customer portal project 
we currently do not foresee material cash outlays associated with capital projects in the coming fiscal year and expect to see lowered cash payments associated with these activities 
cash flows from financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to stock repurchases and proceeds from stock option exercise activity 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal year compared to million used during the same period last year 
this change was primarily due to lower stock buy backs  as we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million in fiscal year while in fiscal year we repurchased approximately million shares at cost of approximately million 
the costs associated with these share buy backs in fiscal year were partially offset by the proceeds from the credit facility that was used to fund the share buy backs 
these cash outflows during fiscal year were partially offset by increased proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and corresponding tax benefits associated with such exercises 
despite a challenging economic environment  we remain focused on increasing our cashflows from operations and improving our operating margins and profitability 
the current economic uncertainties have reduced our visibility in forecasting our future license revenues  from which we largely depend on achieving these goals 
as visibility associated with these future license revenues remain limited  we may  from time to time  rely on cost cutting and swift resizing measures to achieve our objective of growth in operating cashflows  operating margins and profitability 
in early november of  we entered into a revolving credit agreement with wells fargo foothill and secured a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of up to million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of credit risk  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange risk 
during fiscal years  and we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
we face exposure to market risk on the related receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were approximately  in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and approximately  during fiscal year interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we typically invest in high quality debt securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on variable rate debt under our revolving credit facility 
we have drawn million on our million credit facility as of december  and an additional million was drawn in february of fiscal year to fund our recent acquisition of xenos 
we expect to pay approximately million in interest annually through fiscal year the interest may increase significantly if we decide to draw on the remaining million balance under this arrangement or if interest rates were to increase significantly 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the outstanding portion of our million debt obligation as of february  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in annual interest expense that would result from an immediate increase decrease in interest rates 
the analysis is shown as of february  change in annual interest expense in thousands credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments to only investment grade securities 
we also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified by geography and no single customer has accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue on an annual basis 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments portfolio includes auction rate securities ars 
the ars market was highly liquid prior to fiscal year during fiscal year  however  a substantial number of auctions failed  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue of the securities that holders desired to sell at auction 
additional information regarding our ars investment portfolio is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements for the period ended december  
table of contents we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results of operations 
the company is not currently invested in any derivative securities
