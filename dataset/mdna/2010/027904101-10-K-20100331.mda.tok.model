recent accounting pronouncements during the third quarter of  the company adopted asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification asc as the sole source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification did not change gaap but reorganizes the literature 
references for fasb guidance throughout this document have been updated for the codification 
the company adopted asc topic formerly sfas no 
 subsequent events during the second quarter of which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
asc topic provides guidance on the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this guidance was amended by accounting standards update asu in february the adoption of asc topic including the updated guidance did not have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements contained herein  the company makes estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company believes that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on its financial statements due to the materiality of the accounts involved  and therefore  considers these to be its critical accounting policies 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that the company believes are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable the company makes ongoing assumptions relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on the balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  the company considers its historical level of credit losses 
the company also makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and it assesses current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
the company recorded reserves for uncollectible accounts receivables of  as of december   which is equal to approximately of total accounts receivable 
while the company believes that the current reserves are adequate to cover potential credit losses  it cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of its customers and the company cannot guarantee that its reserves will continue to be adequate 
for each that actual credit losses exceed the reserves established  there would be an increase in general and administrative expenses and a reduction in reported net income of approximately  conversely  for each that actual credit losses are less than the reserve  this would decrease the company s general and administrative expenses and increase the reported net income by approximately  fixed assets fixed assets are stated at cost 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is being provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  impairment losses have not been required 
any change in the assumption of estimated useful lives could either result in a decrease or increase the company s financial results 
a decrease in estimated useful life would reduce the company s net income and an increase in estimated useful life would increase the company s net income 
if the estimated useful lives of the pers medical device were decreased by one year  the cost of goods related to services would increase and net income would decrease by approximately  conversely  if the estimated useful lives of the pers medical device were increased by one year  the cost of goods related to services would decrease and net income would increase by approximately  valuation of goodwill goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are subject to annual impairment tests 
to date  the company has not been required to recognize an impairment of goodwill 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances occur  indicating goodwill might be impaired 
this process involves estimating fair value using discounted cash flow analyses 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts 
the company cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill  which totaled  at december  and  at december  if the company were to experience a significant adverse impact on goodwill  it would negatively impact the company s net income 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation is recorded in accordance with asc topic formerly fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock and employee stock options  based on estimated fair values
