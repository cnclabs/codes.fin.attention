item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with i our audited financial statements as at the years ended july  and  and for each of the years in the three year period ended july  and the related notes  and ii the section of this annual report entitled business that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in the section entitled risk factors 
our financial statements are stated in united states dollars and are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
plan of operations our plan of operations for the next twelve months is to continue with the exploration and development of our mineral properties 
our planned geological exploration programs are described in detail in this annual report under business 
as well  the reclamation activities at mt 
lucas are expected to be complete within the next twelve months 
the minor reclamation activities at hobson  which will be placed in a disposal well  are also expected to be complete within fiscal mining activities at our palangana site are expected to commence by the end of with the ore being transported to and processed at our hobson processing facility 
our planned exploration expenditures for the next twelve months on our mineral properties  together with amounts due to maintain our interest in these claims  are summarized as follows name of property planned exploration expenditures amounts of claims maintenance due amount of property payment due goliad nil nil an amount of approximately  has been budgeted for additional surveys and studies as may be required by the respective approval authorities 
at this time it has not been determined whether or not the company will be required to draw upon the budgeted funds 
name of property planned exploration expenditures amounts of claims maintenance due planned development expenditures la palangana in addition  we will incur general and administrative expenses throughout the year that we anticipate will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to our regulatory filings throughout the year  as well as transfer agent fees  management fees  investor relations and general office expenses 
we had cash in the amount of  and a working capital surplus in the amount of  as of july  we anticipate that existing cash resources will be sufficient to carry out our exploration programs and current plan of operations for the next twelve months 
in the event we require additional financing to pursue our plan of operations for the next months  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
beyond the next twelve months  we may be required to obtain additional financing in order to continue our plan of operations as we may not earn any positive cash flow revenues in the foreseeable future 
we believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding additional phases of exploration as we do not wish to encumber any of our tangible assets to secure any debt financing 
we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock 
we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our exploration programs 
in the absence of such financing  we will not be able to continue exploration of our mineral claims 
even if we are successful in obtaining equity financing to fund our exploration programs  there is no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to pursue any advanced explorati on of our mineral claims following the completion of preliminary exploration 
if we do not continue to obtain additional financing  we may be forced to abandon our properties and our plan of operations 
we may consider entering into a joint venture arrangement to provide the required funding to pursue drilling and advanced exploration of our mineral claims 
even if we determined to pursue a joint venture partner  there is no assurance that any third party would enter into a joint venture agreement with us in order to fund exploration of our mineral claims 
if we entered into a joint venture arrangement  we would likely have to assign a percentage of our interest in our mineral claims to the joint venture partner 
our exploration plans will be continually evaluated and modified as exploration results become available 
modifications to our plans will be based on many factors  including results of exploration  assessment of data  weather conditions  exploration costs  the price of uranium and available capital 
further  the extent of our exploration programs that we undertake will be dependent upon the amount of financing available to us 
results of operations we are an exploration stage company and have not generated any revenue to date

net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended july  was  compared to  during the seven months ended july  during the current period  we received net proceeds of  primarily from the sale of our common stock pursuant to private placements 
we expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities 
our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business 
discontinued operations net cash relating to discontinued operation that was used in operating activities during the year ended july  was nil compared to  in the same period ended july  since inception  net cash relating to discontinued operation that was used in operating activities through july  was  no change from july net cash relating to discontinued operations that was provided by investing activities during the year ended july  was  compared to nil in the same period ended july  since inception  net cash relating to discontinued operations that was provided by investing activities through july  was  compared to net cash used in investing activities through july  of  stock options and warrants as at july   we had  stock options and  share purchase warrants outstanding

accordingly  as at july   the outstanding options and warrants represented a total of  shares issuable for proceeds of approximately  if these options and warrants were exercised in full 
the exercise of these options and warrants is at the discretion of the holders and  accordingly  there is no assurance that any of these options or warrants will be exercised 
plan of operation and funding our existing working capital is expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months 
we have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements 
generally  we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments 
in connection with our business plan  management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to i uranium exploration operating activities  ii possible future reserve definition  iii possible future mining initiatives on current and future properties  and iv possible future property acquisitions 
we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities  and debt issuances 
we expect we will need to raise additional capital to meet long term operating requirements 
additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders 
further  such securities might have right s  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities  which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations 
going concern we commenced operations on may  and have not realized any significant revenues since inception 
as at july  we have working capital of  and an accumulated deficit of  although existing cash resources are currently expected to provide sufficient funds through the upcoming year  the capital expenditures required to achieve planned principal operations may be substantial 
our continuation as a going concern for a period of longer than the upcoming year is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary financing 
we are in the exploration stage of our mineral property development and to date have not yet established any proven mineral reserves on our existing properties 
our continued operations and the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets are ultimately dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations 
to date  we have completed private placements and received funding through the exercise of stock options and share purc hase warrants for net proceeds of  from the issuance of shares of our common stock 
material commitments we are committed to pay our key executives a total of approximately  per year for management services 
the company is currently leasing office premises in new mexico  texas and vancouver  bc  canada with total monthly payments of  all office lease agreements are on a month to month basis with the exception of the corpus christi office lease which expires in august the following sets forth our contractual obligations in tabular form as at july  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations nil nil nil nil nil operating leases nil nil purchase obligations nil nil nil nil nil other long term liabilities nil nil reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap nil nil nil nil nil nil nil purchase of significant equipment we may acquire significant equipment as may be deemed required to conduct and continue ordinary course of business in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
mineral property costs we are primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploration and development of mineral properties 
mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized when incurred 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  the company assesses the carrying costs for impairment under asc  property  plant  and equipment 
if proven and probable reserves are established for a property and it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed  costs will be amortized using the units of production method over the estimated life of the reserve 
mineral property exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred until the establishment of economically viable reserves 
as of the date of this annual report  we have yet to establish proven or probable reserves on any of our mineral properties 
databases costs related to internally developed databases are expensed as incurred 
costs of acquired mineral property databases are capitalized upon acquisition 
mineral property data bases are tested for impairment whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
mineral property databases are amortized over five years using the straight line method  which is the period over which management believes the asset will contribute to the company s cash flows 
restoration and remediation costs asset retirement obligations various federal and state mining laws and regulations require us to reclaim the surface areas and restore underground water quality for its mine projects to the pre existing mine area average quality after the completion of mining 
future reclamation and remediation costs  which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation  are accrued based on management s best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at each project 
such estimates would be determined by our engineering studies calculating the cost of future of surface and groundwater activities  current regulations  actual expenses incurred  and technology and industry standards 
in accordance with asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations  we capitalize the measured fair value of asset retirement obligations to mineral rights and properties 
the asset retirement obligation is accreted to an undiscounted value until the time at which it they are expected to be settled 
actual retirement costs will be recorded against the asset retirement obligations when incurred 
any difference between the recorded asset retirement obligations and the actual retirement costs incurred will be recorded as a gain or loss in the period of settlement 
on a quarterly basis we update cost estimates  and other assumptions used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations at each of our mineral properties to reflect new events  changes in circumstances and any new information that is available 
changes in these costs have a corresponding impact on the asset retirement obligations 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when t he carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
financial instruments the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  other current monetary assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short term maturity of these financial instruments 
our operations and financing activities are conducted primarily in united states dollars  and as a result we are not subject to significant exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates 
management has determined that we are not exposed to significant credit risk 
stock based compensation we follow asc  compensation stock compensation  which addresses the accounting for stock based payment transactions  requiring such transactions to be accounted for using the fair value method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of stock based awards under asc the fair value is recorded in income depending on the terms and conditions of the award and the nature of the relationship of the recipient of the award to us 
we record the grant date fair value in income in line with the period over which it was earned 
for employees and management this is typically considered to be the vesting period of the award 
for consultants the fair value of the award is recorded in income over the term of the service period  and unvested amounts are revalued at each reporting period over the service period 
we estimate the expected forfeitures and update the valuation accordingly 
recently adopted accounting policies effective august   we adopted asc  business combinations 
under asc  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
asc changes the accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination 
under the new guidance  business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method  compared to the purchase method mandated previously 
asc applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the more significant changes to our accounting for business combinations that will result from applying the acquisition method include i the definition of a business is broadened to include some development stage entities  and therefore more acquis itions may be accounted for as business combinations rather than asset acquisitions  ii the measurement date for equity interests issued by the acquirer is the acquisition date instead of a few days before and after terms are agreed to and announced which may significantly change the amount recorded for the acquired business if share prices differ from the agreement and announcement date to the acquisition date  iii all future adjustments to income tax estimates will be recorded to income tax expense  whereas under the previous requirements  certain changes in income tax estimates were recorded to goodwill  iv acquisition related costs of the acquirer  including investment banking fees  legal fees  accounting fees  valuation fees and other professional or consulting fees will be expensed as incurred  whereas under the previous guidance these costs were capitalized as part of the business combination  v the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination  whether full  partia l or step acquisition  result in all assets and liabilities recorded at of fair value  whereas under the previous requirements only the controlling interest s portion is recorded at fair value  vi recognition of a bargain purchase gain when the fair value of the identifiable assets exceeds the purchase price  whereas under the previous guidance  the net book value of the identifiable assets would have been adjusted downward  and vii the non controlling interest will be recorded at its share of fair value of net assets acquired  including its share of goodwill  whereas under previous guidance the non controlling interest is recorded at its share of the carrying value of net assets acquired with no goodwill being allocated 
the adoption of asc resulted in certain differences to the recording of the purchase equation compared to how it would have been recorded under previous guidance 
transaction costs of  have been expensed rather than capitalized into the purchase equation 
in addition  the assessment of the measurement date may have been different and therefore have caused a different valuation of the consideration 
effective august   we adopted asc  consolidation

effective august   we adopted asc  debt  debt with conversion and other options formerly apb opinion no 

asc requires cash settled convertible debt to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar bond without the conversion feature 
the difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effective august   we adopted asc  earnings per share  general formerly eitf 
asc addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method as described in asc  earnings per share 
under the guidance in asc  unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
all prior period earnings per share amounts presented are adjusted retrospectively

 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
the amendments in this accounting standards update replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity s in volvement in variable interest entities  which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements 
the standard will be effective for the years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements
