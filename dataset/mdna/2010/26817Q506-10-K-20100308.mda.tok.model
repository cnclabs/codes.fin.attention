such margin calls could adversely change our liquidity position 
if we fail to meet this margin call  the lender has the right to terminate the repurchase agreement and immediately sell the collateral 
if the proceeds from the sale of the collateral are insufficient to repay the entire amount of the repurchase agreement outstanding  we would be required to repay any shortfall 
all of our repurchase agreements provide that the lender is responsible for obtaining collateral valuations  which must be from a generally recognized source agreed to by both us and the lender  or the most recent closing quotation of such source 
given the uncommitted nature of repurchase agreement financing and the varying collateral requirements  we cannot assume that we will always be able to roll over our repurchase agreements as they mature 
in order to attempt to mitigate liquidity risk  we typically pledge only agency mbs and aaa rated non agency securities to secure our outstanding repurchase agreements 
we attempt to maintain an appropriate amount of cash and unpledged investments in order to meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements and to fund our on going operations

credit risk credit risk is the risk that we will not receive all contractual amounts due on investments that we have purchased or funded due to default by the borrower or due to a deficiency in proceeds from the liquidation of the collateral securing the obligation 
to mitigate credit risk  certain of our investments  such as agency mbs and portions of our securitized mortgage loan portfolio  contain a guaranty of payment from third parties 
for example  our agency mbs have credit risk to the extent that fannie mae or freddie mac fails to remit payments on these mbs for which they have issued a guaranty of payment 
in addition  certain of our securitized mortgage loans have pool guarantees by which certain parties provide guarantees of repayment on pools of loans up to a limited amount 
the following tables present information as of december  and december  with respect to our investments and the amounts guaranteed  if applicable

for our securitized mortgage loans  we also limit our credit risk through the securitization process and the issuance of securitization financing 
the securitization process limits our credit risk from an economic point of view as the securitization financing is recourse only to the assets pledged 
therefore  our risk is limited to the difference between the amount of securitized mortgage loans pledged in excess of the amount of securitization financing outstanding 
this difference is referred to as overcollateralization

aside from guaranty of payment and the securitization process  we also attempt to minimize our credit risk by investing in mortgage loans collateralized by multi family low income housing tax credit lihtc properties  which by nature have a lower risk of default 
mortgage loans secured by these properties account for of our securitized commercial loan portfolio 
lihtc properties are properties eligible for tax credits under section of the code  as amended 

section of the code provides tax credits to investors in projects to construct or substantially rehabilitate properties that provide housing for qualifying low income families for as much as of the eligible cost basis of the property 
failure by the borrower to comply with certain income and rental restrictions required by section or  more importantly  a default on a mortgage loan financing a section property during the section prescribed tax compliance period generally years from the date the property is placed in service can result in the recapture of previously used tax credits from the borrower 
the potential cost of tax credit recapture has historically provided an incentive to the property owner to support the property during the compliance period  including making debt service payments on the loan if necessary to keep the loan current 
as of december   there were delinquent lihtc commercial mortgage loans with a total unpaid principal balance of million compared to delinquent lihtc commercial mortgage loans with a total unpaid principal balance of million as of december  the following table shows the weighted average remaining compliance period of our portfolio of lihtc commercial loans as a percent of the total lihtc commercial loan portfolio as of december  and december months remaining to end of compliance period december  december  compliance period already exceeded up to one year remaining between one and three years remaining between four and six years remaining total other efforts to mitigate credit risk include maintaining a risk management function which monitors and oversees the performance of the servicers of the mortgage loans  as well as providing an allowance for loan loss as required by gaap 
interest rate risk our strategy of investing in interest rate sensitive investments on a leveraged basis subjects us to interest rate risk 
this risk arises from the difference in the timing of resets of interest rates on our investments versus the associated borrowings or differences in the indices on which the investments reset versus the borrowings 
at any given time  our investments may consist of hybrid agency arms which have a fixed rate of interest for an initial period  agency arms or adjustable rate mortgage loans which generally have interest rates which reset annually based on a spread to an index such as libor and which are subject to interim and lifetime interest rate caps  and fixed rate mortgage loans 
of our agency arms and adjustable rate loans  approximately of these loans reset based upon the level of six month libor  reset based on the level of one year libor and reset based on the level of one year cmt 
periodic or lifetime interest rate caps could limit the amount that the interest rate may reset 
generally the borrowings used to finance these assets will have interest rates resetting every to days and they will not have periodic or lifetime interest rate caps 
periodic caps on our investments range from annually  and lifetime caps are generally 
in addition  certain of our securitized mortgage loans have a fixed rate of interest and are financed with borrowings with interest rates that adjust monthly 
during a period of rising short term interest rates  the rates on our borrowings will reset higher on a more frequent basis than the interest rates on our investments  decreasing our net interest income earned and the corresponding cash flow on our investments 
conversely  net interest income may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
the net interest income may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap or cap agreements to the extent that we have entered into such agreements 
in an effort to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the mismatch in the timing of the interest rate resets in our investments versus our borrowings  we may enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward purchase commitments and interest rate swaps  which are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on our repurchase agreements  which rates are typically libor based 
swaps generally result in interest savings in a rising interest rate environment  while a declining interest rate environment generally results in our paying the stated fixed rate on the notional amount for each of the swap transactions  which could be higher than the market rate 
as of december   the interest rates on our investments and the associated borrowings on these investments will prospectively reset based on the following time frames not considering the impact of prepayments and including interest rate swaps investments borrowings amounts in thousands amounts percent amounts percent fixed rate investments obligations adjustable rate investments obligations less than months greater than months and less than year greater than year and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years and less than years total the investment amount represents the fair value of the related securities and amortized cost basis of the related loans  excluding any related allowance for loan losses 
as of december   the interest rates on our investments and the associated borrowings  if any  on these investments would have prospectively reset based on the following time frames not considering the impact of prepayments investments borrowings amounts in thousands amounts percent amounts percent fixed rate investments obligations adjustable rate investments obligations less than months greater than months and less than year greater than year and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years and less than years total the investment amount represents the fair value of the related securities and amortized cost basis of the related loans  excluding any related allowance for loan losses 
adjustable rate mortgage loans collateralize our hybrid agency and agency arm mbs portfolio 
the interest rates on the adjustable rate mortgage loans are typically fixed for a predetermined period and then adjust annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index 
interest rate caps impact a security s yield and its time to reset to market rates 
the following table presents information about the lifetime and interim interest rate caps on our hybrid agency mbs portfolio as of december lifetime interest rate caps on arm mbs interim interest rate caps on arm mbs of total of total to to to tabular presentation we monitor the aggregate cash flow  projected net interest income and estimated market value of our investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
the table below presents immediate changes of and basis points to the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  and assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rates relative to the forward libor curve 
as of december   one month libor was and six month libor was 
the interest rate environment as of december  reflected historically low short term libor rates 
modeled libor rates used to determine the basis point change in interest rates ranged from a low of to a high of during the modeled period 
no changes in the shape  or slope  of the interest rate curves were assumed for this analysis 
the information presented in the table below projects the impact of sudden changes in interest rates on our annual projected net interest income and projected portfolio value  as more fully discussed below  based on our investments as of december   and includes all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
percentage change in projected net interest income equals the change that would occur in the calculated net interest income for the next twenty four months relative to the change scenario if interest rates were to instantaneously parallel shift to and remain at the stated level for the next twenty four months 
percentage change in projected market value equals the change in value of our assets at the end of the twenty fourth month that we carry at fair value rather than at historical amortized cost and any change in the value of any derivative instruments or hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements  in the event of an interest rate shift as described above 
the analysis below is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates beyond the forward libor curve  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of our assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain investments which we own provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting the portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below for all investments owned by us except for agency mbs 
for agency mbs  prepayment rates are adjusted based on modeled and management estimates for each of the rate scenarios set forth below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to our portfolio  and no change to our liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in our investment portfolio and the liabilities incurred by us in response to interest rate movement  as such changes are a tool by which we can mitigate interest rate risk in response to changed conditions 
as a result of anticipated prepayments on assets in the investment portfolio  there are likely to be such changes in the future 
basis point change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected market value many assumptions are made to present the information in the above table and  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur  or that other events will not occur  that would affect the outcomes  therefore  the above tables and all related disclosures constitute forward looking statements 
the analyses presented utilize assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales or acquisitions of investments  prepayments of investments  or a restructuring of our investment portfolio could materially change the interest rate risk profile for us 
the tables quantify the potential changes in net interest income and net asset value over a twenty four month period should interest rates change by the amounts indicated in the table on an instantaneous  parallel basis 
the results of interest rate shocks of plus and minus and basis points are presented 
the cash flows associated with our investment portfolio for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions including prepayment speeds  time until coupon reset  slope of the yield curve  and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on interest rate sensitive liabilities include anticipated interest rates no negative rates are utilized  collateral requirements as a percent of the borrowing and amount of borrowing 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on net asset value of interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayment rates and the yield spread of mortgage related assets relative to prevailing interest rates
