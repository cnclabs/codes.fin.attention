liquidity and capital resources the company s fee generating businesses are non capital intensive and all produce positive operating cash flows 
as such  a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to the fee based segments and any liquidity or capital needs are satisfied using cash flow from operations 
therefore  the liquidity and capital resources discussion is concentrated on the company s liquidity and capital needs to meet existing debt obligations  primarily unsecured corporate debt and debt facilities in the asset generation and management operating segment  and fund new ffelp student loan originations 
the company may issue equity and debt securities in the future in order to improve capital  increase liquidity  refinance upcoming maturities  or provide for general corporate purposes 
moreover  the company may from time to time repurchase certain amounts of its outstanding secured and unsecured debt securities  including debt securities which the company may issue in the future  for cash and or through exchanges for other securities 
such repurchases or exchanges may be made in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  compliance with securities laws  and other factors 
the amounts involved in any such transactions may be material 
the company has historically utilized operating cash flow  secured financing transactions which include warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations  operating lines of credit  and other borrowing arrangements to fund its asset generation and management operations and student loan acquisitions 
in addition  the company has used operating cash flow  borrowings on its unsecured line of credit  and unsecured debt offerings to fund corporate activities  business acquisitions  and repurchases of common stock 
the company has also used its common stock to partially fund certain business acquisitions 
the company has a universal shelf registration statement with the sec which allows the company to sell up to million of securities that may consist of common stock  preferred stock  unsecured debt securities  warrants  stock purchase contracts  and stock purchase units 
the terms of any securities are established at the time of the offering 
the following table summarizes the company s debt obligations

these notes are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
if the credit market conditions improve  the company anticipates selling these notes to third parties 
upon a sale to third parties  the company would obtain cash proceeds equal to the market value of the notes on the date of such sale 
the amount included in the table above is the par value of these subordinated notes as of march  and may not represent market value upon sale of the notes 
b during  the company purchased million of its own asset backed securities bonds and notes payable 
for accounting purposes  these notes were effectively retired and are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
however  these securities are legally outstanding at the trust level and the company could sell these notes to third parties 
upon a sale to third parties  the company would obtain cash proceeds equal to the market value of the notes on the date of such sale 
the amount included in the table above is the par value of these notes as of march  and may not represent market value upon sale of the notes 
cash generated from operations in addition to current sources of liquidity  the company plans to use cash generated from operations to satisfy its unsecured debt obligations 
the company has historically generated positive cash flow from operations 
for the years ended december    and  the company had net cash flow from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
liquidity needs and sources of liquidity available to satisfy debt obligations secured by student loan assets and related collateral the company had the following debt obligations outstanding that are secured by student loan assets and related collateral 
as of december  carrying final amount maturity asset generation and management bonds and notes issued in asset backed securitizations department of education participation ffelp warehouse facility department of education conduit other borrowings and bonds and notes issued in asset backed securitizations the majority of the company s portfolio of student loans is funded in asset backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturity of the funded assets and there are minimal liquidity issues related to these facilities 
in addition  due to the difference between the yield the company receives on the loans and cost of financing within these transactions  the company has created a portfolio that will generate earnings and significant cash flow over the life of these transactions 
based on cash flow models developed to reflect management s current estimate of  among other factors  prepayments  defaults  deferment  forbearance  and interest rates  the company currently expects future undiscounted cash flows from its portfolio to be approximately billion as detailed below 
this amount does not include cash flows that the company expects to receive related to loans funded through the department of education s conduit and loan participation programs and other warehouse facilities 
the company expects the future cash flows shown below would correspond to earnings when excluding the amortization of loan premiums and deferred origination costs  potential derivative activity used by the company to hedge the portfolio  and other portfolio management and administrative costs 
because the company does not use gain on sale accounting when issuing asset backed securitizations  the future earnings of these transactions are not yet reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
department of education participation ffelp warehouse facility the department of education participation and ffelp warehouse facility are further discussed below under sources of liquidity available to fund new ffelp stafford and plus loan originations for the academic year 
department of education conduit in january  the department published summary terms for its program under which it will finance eligible ffelp stafford and plus loans in a conduit vehicle established to provide funding for student lenders the conduit program 
loans eligible for the conduit program had to be first disbursed on or after october   but not later than june   and fully disbursed before september   and meet certain other requirements 
the conduit program was launched on may  funding for the conduit program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates  with the company being advanced percent of the student loan face amount 
excess amounts needed to fund the remaining percent of the student loan balances are contributed by the company 
the conduit program has a term of five years and expires on may  the student loan short term notes student loan notes issued by the conduit program are supported by a combination of i notes backed by ffelp loans  ii a liquidity agreement with the federal financing bank  and iii a put agreement provided by the department 
if the conduit does not have sufficient funds to pay all student loan notes  then those student loan notes will be repaid with funds from the federal financing bank 
the federal financing bank will hold the notes for a short period of time and  if at the end of that time  the student loan notes still cannot be paid off  the underlying ffelp loans that serve as collateral to the conduit program will be sold to the department through the put agreement at a price of percent of the face amount of the loans 
sources of liquidity available to fund new ffelp stafford and plus loan originations for the academic year the company has reliable sources of liquidity available for new ffelp stafford and plus loan originations for the academic year under the department s participation and purchase programs

the company plans to fund all academic year loans using the participation program  the agreement with union bank  and the new ffelp warehouse facility 
these facilities are described in further detail below 
department of education s loan participation and purchase commitment programs in august  the department implemented the purchase and participation programs pursuant to ecasla 
under the department s purchase program  the department will purchase loans at a price equal to the sum of i par value  ii accrued interest  iii the one percent origination fee paid to the department  and iv a fixed amount of per loan 
under the participation program  the department provides interim short term liquidity to ffelp lenders by purchasing participation interests in pools of ffelp loans 
ffelp lenders are charged a rate of commercial paper plus basis points on the principal amount of participation interests outstanding 
loans funded under the participation program for the academic year were required to be either refinanced by the lender or sold to the department pursuant to the purchase program prior to its expiration on october  to be eligible for purchase or participation under the department s programs  loans were originally limited to ffelp stafford or plus loans made for the academic year  first disbursed between may  and july   with eligible borrower benefits 
on october   legislation was enacted to extend the department s authority to address ffelp student loans made for the academic year and allowing for the extension of the participation program and purchase program from september  to september  the department indicated that loans for the academic year funded under the department s participation program were required to be refinanced or sold to the department prior to october  on november   the department announced the replication of the terms of the participation and purchase programs  in accordance with the october  legislation  which will include ffelp student loans made for the academic year

the agreement automatically renews annually and is terminable by either party upon five business days notice 
this agreement provides beneficiaries of union bank s grantor trusts with access to investments in interests in student loans  while providing liquidity to the company on a short term basis 
the company can participate loans to union bank to the extent of availability under the grantor trusts  up to million or an amount in excess of million if mutually agreed to by both parties 
loans participated under this agreement have been accounted for by the company as loan sales 
accordingly  the participation interests sold are not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
ffelp warehouse facility on august   the company entered into the ffelp warehouse facility 
the ffelp warehouse facility has a maximum financing amount of million  with a revolving financing structure supported by day liquidity provisions  which expire on august  the final maturity date of the facility is august  in the event the company is unable to renew the liquidity provisions by august   the facility would become a term facility at a stepped up cost  with no additional student loans being eligible for financing  and the company would be required to refinance the existing loans in the facility by august  the ffelp warehouse facility provides for formula based advance rates depending on ffelp loan type up to a maximum of percent to percent of the principal and interest financed 
the advance rates for collateral may increase or decrease based on market conditions 
the facility contains financial covenants relating to levels of the company s consolidated net worth  ratio of adjusted ebitda to corporate debt interest  and unencumbered cash 
any violation of these covenants could result in a requirement for the immediate repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the facility 
unlike the company s prior ffelp warehouse facility  the new facility does not require the company to refinance or remove a percentage of the pledged student loan collateral on an annual basis 
as of december  and march   million and million  respectively  was outstanding under this facility and million and million  respectively  was available for future use 
upon termination or expiration of the facility  the company would expect to access the securitization market  use operating cash  rely on sale of assets  or transfer collateral to satisfy any remaining obligations 
asset backed securities transactions depending on market conditions  the company anticipates continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
asset backed securities transactions would be used to refinance student loans included in the ffelp warehouse facility  the department of education conduit facility  and or existing asset backed security transactions 
the ffelp warehouse facility and doe conduit facility have advance rates that are less than par 
as of december  and march   the company had approximately million and million  respectively  advanced in operating cash for the ffelp warehouse facility and million and million  respectively  advanced in operating cash for the doe conduit facility 
depending on the terms of asset backed security transactions  refinancing loans included in these facilities could produce positive cash flow to the company and are contemplated by management when making student loan financing decisions 
during  the company completed asset backed securities transactions totaling billion 
in addition  on february   the company completed as asset backed securities transaction of million 
the company used the proceeds from the sale of these notes to purchase student loans previously financed in other asset backed securitizations and the ffelp warehouse facility 
description of other debt facilities unsecured line of credit the company has a million unsecured line of credit that terminates in may as of december  and march   there was million outstanding on this line 
the weighted average interest rate on this line of credit was as of december  upon termination in  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this line of credit  find alternative funding  or increase the amount outstanding under the line  if necessary 
the lending commitment under the company s unsecured line of credit is provided by a total of thirteen banks  with no individual bank representing more than of the total lending commitment 
the bank lending group includes lehman brothers bank  a subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc  which represents approximately of the lending commitment under the line of credit 
on september   lehman brothers holdings inc filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the company does not expect lehman to fund future borrowing requests 
as of december  and march   excluding lehman s lending commitment  the company had million available for future use under its unsecured line of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that  if not met  lead to an event of default under the agreement 
the covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth a minimum adjusted ebitda to corporate debt interest over the last four rolling quarters a limitation on subsidiary indebtedness a limitation on the percentage of non guaranteed loans in the company s portfolio as of december   the company was in compliance with all of these requirements 
many of these covenants are duplicated in the company s other lending facilities  including its ffelp warehouse facilities 
a default on the ffelp warehouse facility would result in an event of default on the company s unsecured line of credit that would result in the outstanding balance on the line of credit becoming immediately due and payable 
the company s operating line of credit does not have any covenants related to unsecured debt ratings 
however  changes in the company s ratings as well as the amounts the company borrows have modest implications on the pricing level at which the company obtains funding

any such transaction will depend on prevailing market conditions  liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  compliance with securities laws  and other factors 
the company s senior notes due senior notes were previously covered debt under a replacement capital covenant dated september  the rcc 
under the rcc  if million or more of the senior notes remained outstanding  the company was restricted in its ability to repurchase or redeem its junior subordinated hybrid securities 
on september   the company announced that less than million of the senior notes remained outstanding  and therefore the rcc no longer provided any benefit to the holders of the senior notes 
the company has no other eligible senior debt or eligible subordinated debt under the terms of the rcc  therefore the rcc and the restrictions on repurchase or redemption of the junior subordinated hybrid securities are of no further force and effect

critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below allowance for loan losses  revenue recognition  impairment assessments related to goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  and accounting for derivatives 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses on student loans 
this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on its federally insured loan portfolio separately from its non federally insured loan portfolio 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  delinquency status  type of program  and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest is days past due and charges off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
revenue recognition student loan income the company recognizes student loan income as earned  net of amortization of loan premiums and deferred origination costs 
loan income is recognized based upon the expected yield of the loan after giving effect to borrower utilization of incentives such as principal reductions for timely payments borrower benefits and other yield adjustments 
the estimate of the borrower benefits discount is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive and liquidity purposes  the company frequently changes the borrower benefit programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefit discount 
loan premiums  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
the most sensitive estimate for loan premiums  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits is the estimate of the constant prepayment rate cpr 
cpr is a variable in the life of loan estimate that measures the rate at which loans in a portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is directly correlated to the average life of the portfolio 
cpr equals the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate such as the rate of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the amount of loan premium and deferred origination cost amortization recognized by the company in a particular period 
loan and guaranty servicing revenue loan servicing fees are determined according to individual agreements with customers and are calculated based on the dollar value of loans  number of loans  or number of borrowers serviced for each customer 
guaranty servicing fees  generally  are calculated based on the number of loans serviced  volume of loans serviced  or amounts collected 
tuition payment processing and campus commerce revenue fees for payment management services are recognized over the period in which services are provided to customers 
enrollment services revenue enrollment services revenue primarily consists of the following items lead generation revenue from lead generation is derived primarily from fees which are earned through the delivery of qualified leads or clicks 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a qualified lead or click is delivered to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain 
from time to time  the company may agree to credit certain leads or clicks if they fail to meet the contractual or other guidelines of a particular client 
the company has established a sales reserve based on historical experience 
to date  such credits have been immaterial and within management s expectations 
for a portion of its lead revenue  the company has agreements with providers of online media or traffic publishers used in the generation of leads or clicks 
the company receives a fee from its customers and pays a fee to publishers either on a cost per lead  cost per click  or cost per number of impressions basis 
the company is the primary obligor in the transaction 
as a result  the fees paid by the company s customers are recognized as revenue and the fees paid to its publishers are included in cost to provide enrollment services in the company s consolidated statements of income 
publishing and editing services revenue from the sale of print products and editing services is generally earned and recognized  net of estimated returns  upon shipment or delivery 
content management and recruitment services content management and recruitment services includes the sale of subscription and performance based products and services  as well as list sales 
revenues from sales of subscription and performance based products and services are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
subscription and performance based revenues received or receivable in advance of the delivery of services is included in deferred revenue 
revenue from the sale of lists is generally earned and recognized  net of estimated returns  upon delivery 
fees associated with the majority of the services described above are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties 
the company assesses collectability of revenues and its allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to record accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
if the company determines that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured at or prior to delivery of the company s services  revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of november and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performs a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets annually and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist 
each quarter the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of the company s intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and internal forecasts 
although the company believes the historical assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the reported financial results 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the u 
s and its states and municipalities in which the company operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
the company reviews these balances quarterly and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted  as appropriate 
derivative accounting the company records derivative instruments at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
the company determines the fair value for its derivative contracts using either i pricing models that consider current market conditions and the contractual terms of the derivative contract or ii counterparty valuations 
these factors include interest rates  time value  forward interest rate curve  and volatility factors  as well as foreign exchange rates 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
management has structured all of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings 
net settlements on derivatives are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the consolidated statements of income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could impact the company due to shifts in market interest rates 
because the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet is a key profitability driver 
the following table sets forth the company s loan assets and debt instruments by rate characteristics as of december  dollars percent dollars percent fixed rate loan assets variable rate loan assets total fixed rate debt instruments variable rate debt instruments total loans originated prior to april  generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment or sap formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company may earn additional spread income that it refers to as floor income 
depending on the type of loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company may earn floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income  and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on july  the company may earn floor income to the next reset date  which the company refers to as variable rate floor income 
in accordance with legislation enacted in  lenders are required to rebate fixed rate floor income and variable rate floor income to the department for all new ffelp loans first originated on or after april  for the years ended december    and  loan interest income includes approximately million  million  and million of fixed rate floor income  respectively 
the amount of fixed rate floor income has increased over the last few years due to a decrease in interest rates 
if interest rates remain low  the company anticipates continuing to earn significant fixed rate floor income in future periods 
as a result of the ongoing volatility of interest rates  effective october   the company changed its calculation of variable rate floor income to better reflect the economic benefit received by the company related to this income taking into consideration the volatility of certain rate indices which offset the value received 
the economic benefit received by the company related to variable rate floor income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
variable rate floor income calculated on a statutory maximum basis was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the variance between variable rate floor income calculated on a statutory maximum basis and the calculation of variable rate floor income to better reflect the economic benefit received by the company was inconsequential for the year ended december  absent the use of derivative instruments  a rise in interest rates may reduce the amount of floor income received and this may have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increasing financing costs  until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with their special allowance payment formulas 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively become variable rate loans  the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced 
the following graph depicts fixed rate floor income for a borrower with a fixed rate of and a sap rate of the following table shows the company s student loan assets that are earning fixed rate floor income as of december  borrower estimated balance of fixed lender variable assets earning interest weighted conversion fixed rate rate range average yield rate a floor income less than a the estimated variable conversion rate is the estimated short term interest rate at which loans would convert to variable rate 
as of december   the short term interest rate was basis points 
the following table summarizes the outstanding derivatives instruments used by the company to hedge fixed rate student loan assets 
as of december  weighted average fixed notional rate paid by maturity amount the company a a for all interest rate derivatives for which the company pays a fixed rate  the company receives discrete three month libor 
as of december   the company had billion of student loan assets that were eligible to earn variable rate floor income 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of the company s assets do not match the interest rate characteristics of the funding 
the company attempts to match the interest rate characteristics of certain pools of loan assets with debt instruments of substantially similar characteristics 
due to the variability in duration of the company s assets and varying market conditions  the company does not attempt to perfectly match the interest rate characteristics of the entire loan portfolio with the underlying debt instruments 
the company has adopted a policy of periodically reviewing the mismatch related to the interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities together with the company s outlook as to current and future market conditions 
based on those factors  the company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy 
derivative instruments used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy currently include interest rate swaps  basis swaps  and cross currency swaps 
the following table presents the company s ffelp student loan assets and related funding arranged by underlying indices as of december  index g frequency of variable resets assets debt outstanding that funded student loan assets a month h financial commercial paper b daily month treasury bill c varies month libor d quarterly auction rate or remarketing varies asset backed commercial paper e varies fixed rate other f a the company has certain basis swaps outstanding in which the company receives three month libor and pays one month libor plus or minus a spread as defined in the agreements the basis swaps 
the company entered into these derivative instruments to better match the interest rate characteristics on its student loan assets and the debt funding such assets 
the following table summarizes these derivatives as of december  maturity notional amount b the company s ffelp student loans earn interest based on the daily average h financial commercial paper index calculated on a fiscal quarter 
the company s funding includes ffelp student loans under the department s participation program 
the interest rate on the principal amount of participation interests outstanding under the department s participation program is based on a rate of commercial paper plus basis points  which is set a quarter in arrears  while the earnings on the student loans is based primarily on the daily average h financial commercial paper index calculated on the current fiscal quarter 
c the company has used derivative instruments to hedge both the basis and repricing risk on certain student loans in which the company earns interest based on a treasury bill rate that resets daily and are funded with debt indexed to primarily three month libor 
to hedge these loans  the company has entered into basis swaps in which the company receives three month libor set discretely in advance and pays a weekly treasury bill rate plus a spread as defined in the agreement t bill libor basis swaps 
the following table summarizes these derivatives as of december  maturity notional amount a a these derivatives have forward effective start dates of october million  november million  and december million 
d the company has euro denominated notes that reprice on the euribor index 
the company has entered into derivative instruments cross currency interest rate swaps that convert the euribor index to three month libor 
as a result  these notes are reflected in the three month libor category in the above table 
see foreign currency exchange risk 
e asset backed commercial paper consists of million funded in the company s ffelp warehouse facility and billion funded through the department s conduit program 
funding for the conduit program is provided by the capital markets at a cost based on market rates 
f assets include restricted cash and investments and other assets 
debt outstanding includes other debt obligations secured by student loan assets and related collateral 
g historically  the movement of the various interest rate indices received on the company s student loan assets and paid on the debt to fund such loans was highly correlated 
the short term movement of the indices was dislocated beginning in august this dislocation has had a negative impact on the company s student loan net interest income as compared to historical periods 
financial statement impact of derivative instruments the company recognizes changes in the fair value of derivative instruments currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
management has structured all of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting  consequently  the change in fair value of these derivative instruments is included in the company s operating results 
changes or shifts in the forward yield curve and fluctuations in currency rates can significantly impact the valuation of the company s derivatives 
accordingly  changes or shifts to the forward yield curve and fluctuations in currency rates will impact the financial position and results of operations of the company 
the change in fair value of the company s derivatives are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net in the company s consolidated statements of income and resulted in income of million for the year ended december   expense of million for the year ended december   and income of million for the year ended december  the following summarizes the derivative settlements included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the consolidated statements of income

in addition  as it relates to the effect on earnings  a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the funding index increases basis points and basis points while holding the asset index constant  if the funding index is different than the asset index 
the effect on earnings was performed on the company s variable rate assets and liabilities 
the analysis includes the effects of the company s interest rate and basis swaps in existence during these periods

as a result of this transaction  the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and euro 
the principal and accrued interest on these notes is re measured at each reporting period and recorded on the company s balance sheet in us dollars based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date 
changes in the principal and accrued interest amounts as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in the derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps in connection with the issuance of the euro notes 
under the terms of these derivative instrument agreements  the company receives from a counterparty a spread to the euribor index based on notional amounts of million and million and pays a spread to the libor index based on notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
in addition  under the terms of these agreements  all principal payments on the euro notes will effectively be paid at the exchange rate in effect as of the issuance of the notes 
the company did not qualify these derivative instruments as hedges under accounting authoritative guidance  consequently  the change in fair value is included in the company s operating results 
the following table summarizes the financial statement impact as a result of the remeasurement of the euro notes and change in the fair value of the related derivative instruments 
these amounts are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
year ended december  re measurement of euro notes change in fair value of cross currency derivatives total impact to statements of income expense income the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds generally correlates with the change in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
however  the company will experience unrealized gains or losses related to the cross currency interest rate swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
management intends to hold the cross currency interest rate swaps through the maturity of the euro denominated bonds
