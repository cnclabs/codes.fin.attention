strategy our goal is to be the world s leading design  engineering  and entertainment software and services company for the architecture  engineering and construction  manufacturing  and digital media and entertainment markets 
worldwide business trends such as globalization  sustainability  investment in infrastructure  and the increasing desire to keep data digital  are creating pressure on our customers to improve innovation while enhancing productivity 
we enable customer innovation by delivering the broadest portfolio of products and services for the digital design  visualization  and simulation of real world project performance 
our products help our customers increase efficiency and productivity while solving business challenges 
our customers are seeking differentiation through design  and we believe our products provide them with a competitive advantage to succeed in this environment 
to achieve our goal  we believe that we can capitalize on our competitive advantages  including our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets 
by innovating in existing technology categories  we bring powerful design products to volume markets 
our products are designed to be easy to learn and use and to provide customers low cost of deployment  low total cost of ownership and rapid return on their investment 
in addition  our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products 
we believe that our technological leadership  brand recognition  breadth of product line and large installed base positions us well for longer term growth 
we believe that our large global network of distributors and resellers  third party developers  customers and students is also a competitive advantage 
these relationships provide us with a broad reach into volume markets 
our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services 
we believe that our network of channel partners positions us well for longer term growth 
in addition  we have a significant number of registered third party developers that create products that operate with our software products  further extending our reach into volume markets 
users trained on our products are broadly available from both educational institutions and the existing workforce providing us with a student community of next generation professional users and reducing the cost of training for our customers 
to train the next generation of users  we offer education programs  including classroom support  standardized curricula  instructor development  and specially priced software purchasing options 

table of contents we believe our competitive advantages will help us manage through the current challenging economic environment  and position us well as economies begin to recover 
our strategy to grow over the long term derives from these core strengths 
our growth strategy includes continually increasing the business value of our design tools in a number of ways  and improving the performance and functionality of our existing products with each new release 
our most recent release began in march beyond our non industry or discipline specific horizontal design products  autocad and autocad lt  we develop products addressing industry or discipline specific needs through our vertical design and model based design product offerings 
we continually strive to improve our product functionality and specialization by industry while increasing product interoperability and usability 
we also strive to create innovative ways of delivering better user experiences to our customers 
we believe this ultimately increases our customers satisfaction  the usefulness of our products to our customers and drives customer loyalty 
we believe that expanding our horizontal design product customers portfolios to include our vertical design products and model based design products presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy 
for fiscal  revenue from model based design products decreased  as compared to the prior fiscal year  but as a percentage of total revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal we believe that the adoption of vertical design products and model based design products by our customers in all industries will increase their productivity  as well as result in richer design data 
this migration also poses various risks to us 
in particular  if we do not successfully expand our horizontal design customer base to our vertical design products and model based design products as expected  then we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected 
expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy 
we believe that emerging economies continue to present long term growth opportunities for us  although revenue from emerging economies declined during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from emerging economies represented of fiscal net revenue as compared to of fiscal net revenue 
while we believe there are long term growth opportunities in emerging economies  conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges  including economic volatility  geopolitical risk  intellectual property protection and software piracy 
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products  technology and businesses 
acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers  however  they entail integration challenges and may  in certain instances  negatively impact our operating margins 
we continually review these trade offs in making our decisions of whether to make acquisitions 
the size and frequency of transactions to acquire products  technology and businesses decreased significantly during fiscal as compared to earlier periods 
we currently anticipate that we will selectively acquire products  technology and businesses as compelling opportunities that promote our strategy become available  but the pace at which we make such investments will vary depending upon our business needs  the availability of suitable sellers and technology  and our own financial condition 
global economic conditions deteriorated significantly in fiscal as compared to the conditions that existed during most of fiscal economic contraction in most countries and markets  and global financial market instability  including tighter credit  has impacted our business 
we have seen demand for our products and services decline in each of our major geographies and all the industries we serve during fiscal as compared to fiscal this has negatively impacted our financial results 
our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue  given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses  which consist primarily of employee related expenditures  facilities costs  and depreciation and amortization expense 
we have taken actions in response to these global economic changes that we believe will improve our financial condition in fiscal and beyond 
we believe that by continuing to execute our strategy we can achieve our goal of being the world s leading design and engineering software and services company for the architecture  engineering  and construction  manufacturing  geospatial mapping  and digital media and entertainment markets 

table of contents our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions  including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets  leverage our large global network of distributors and resellers  third party developers  customers  and students  improve the performance and functionality of our products  and that we can adequately protect our intellectual property 
if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations  we may not be able to implement our strategy  which could potentially adversely affect our business 
for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item a  risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regularly reevaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of all our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for multiple element arrangements that include software products  we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority 
if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license  we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered 
if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services  the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual period in the arrangement 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
if we do not believe that collection is probable  the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 
our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure  where distributors sell to resellers  and a one tiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers 
our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor  in a two tiered structure  or reseller  in a one tiered structure  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns  among other criteria 
we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments  regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers 
our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

table of contents product returns reserves 
we permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns  estimated channel inventory levels  the timing of new product introductions and promotions  channel sell in for applicable markets and other factors 
our product returns reserves were million at january  and million at january  product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal year and  we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of million and million  respectively  which reduced our revenue 
marketable securities 
at january  we had million of short and long term marketable securities 
we review our investments in marketable securities quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this determination  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of  and business outlook for  the sponsor  including industry and sector performance  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
this impairment results in a new cost basis in the investment recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
if market  industry  and or sponsor conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
determining the fair value of marketable securities that are not actively traded requires significant judgment 
at january  we had an investment in the reserve international liquidity fund the international fund  a money market fund with an estimated fair value of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the international fund ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below per share 
this occurred as a result of the international fund revaluing its holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers  which filed for chapter bankruptcy on september   and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the international fund 
a third party court appointed supervisor is overseeing  but not managing  the accounting and payment administration of the non us based international fund 
our investment in the international fund is not currently liquid  and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so 
however  based on currently available information  we expect to recover substantially all of our current holdings  net of reserves  from the international fund within the next months 
accordingly  the investment in the international fund is classified in current marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  at january   we owned two auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of million 
our auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that were structured to reset at auction every days 
the securities  which met our investment guidelines at the time the investments were made  have failed to settle in auctions since august and have earned a premium interest rate since that time 
while we expect to recover substantially all of our current holdings  net of reserves  in the auction rate securities  we cannot predict when this will occur or the amount we will receive 
due to the lack of liquidity of these investments  they are included in non current marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
when assessing goodwill for impairment  we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired  or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 

table of contents we recorded an impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal representing the entire goodwill balance of our m e segment as of april  this goodwill balance related to our m e segment s fourth quarter fiscal acquisition of substantially all of the assets of softimage 
in may  we concluded that an impairment of goodwill had occurred as of april   due to revisions to our revenue and cash flow projections in response to the significant and sustained revenue declines we were experiencing in all segments and geographies in the first quarter of fiscal the revenue and cash flow projections were substantially impacted for all segments  and our m e segment was the only segment which had a fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its net assets 
we recorded an impairment charge of million affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal representing the entire goodwill balance associated with our media and entertainment m e segment as of october  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue and cash flow projections for all segments were substantially impacted by the sharp downturn in the global economy and in our business 
our m e segment was the only segment which had a current fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its assets 
should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future  additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill 
as of january   a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill  nor result in impairment of goodwill 
see further discussion of this impairment charge in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
realizability of long lived assets 
we assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets  other than goodwill  annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable 
we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget  shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the results of past impairment reviews 
in assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets  we first determine their fair values  which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets 
if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models  which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows  we would discount the cash flows to assess impairments on long lived assets 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 
in addition to our recoverability assessments  we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made  as well as in subsequent quarters 
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets  primarily a result of tax credits  net operating losses  and timing differences for reserves  accrued liabilities  stock options  purchased technologies and capitalized software  partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and acquired intangibles and valuation allowances against california and canadian deferred tax assets 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax 
table of contents jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors 
any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made 
stock based compensation 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award  and recognize expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of a stock based award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends 
the variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted  as needed 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
legal contingencies 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings and part ii  item  note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the estimated loss 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters  we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards see part ii  item  note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporation herein by reference 
overview of fiscal results of operations fiscal year ended january  as a of net revenue fiscal year ended january  as a of net revenue in millions net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses income from operations our results for fiscal continue to reflect the recent global economic downturn  which has impacted our business on almost every front 
while global macroeconomic indicators remain mixed  there were some slight signs of stabilization during the second half of fiscal job losses and the availability of credit in the major industries we serve are important indicators for our business 
there have been significant job losses around the world over the past two years  and unemployment remains high in several important geographies  including the us additionally  there are a number of mixed data points as to whether credit has become more readily available  and how this continues to impact our customers and partners 
our level of confidence in fiscal revenue forecasts is limited  and consequently we are not able to provide full year fiscal revenue guidance 

table of contents we believe that the recent economic contraction  as well as the financial pressure on our customers  have decreased demand for our products as customers have reduced their work forces  this has resulted in fewer seats of our design software sold and fewer maintenance contracts being renewed 
consequently  we experienced revenue contraction in most products  all geographies and all reportable segments during fiscal as compared to fiscal however  our business appears to show some signs of stabilizing as evidenced by modest increases in revenue from commercial new seat licenses  revenue from every geographic region  revenue from each of our product types and revenue from most of our operating segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the third quarter of fiscal in addition  we continued to make progress in reducing our operating costs  which led to an increase in operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to each of the other quarters in fiscal despite the small growth in these areas  it is not clear to us whether these increases represent sustainable trends 
during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  net revenue decreased  gross profit decreased  operating expenses decreased and income from operations decreased 
the decrease in income from operations in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the reduction in our net revenue without an equivalent reduction of our costs 
the majority of our costs are relatively fixed in the short term as they relate primarily to our workforce 
marketing and sales  research and development and general and administrative expenses declined in total by in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year due to our cost containment efforts 
additionally  we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the unfavorable impacts of our revenue decline during fiscal were partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from our fiscal and fiscal restructuring plans and other cost containment efforts 
our spending decisions are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are not directly variable with fluctuations in revenue 
accordingly  our inability to immediately adjust our operating costs for any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse impact on our profitability 
in the second quarter of fiscal we initiated the fiscal restructuring plan  which reduced headcount by approximately positions globally and consolidated approximately leased facilities around the world in order to reduce our operating expenses 
we took these and other actions in an attempt to better align our cost structure with our recent and anticipated financial results 
other important actions include reductions in discretionary spending and contingent labor costs 
we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us  japan  germany  the united kingdom  france  canada  italy  south korea  australia and china 
the stronger value of the us dollar relative to most of the other currencies  except for the japanese yen  against which the dollar weakened  had a negative effect on operating income during fiscal as compared to fiscal had exchange rates from fiscal been in effect during fiscal on a constant currency basis  net revenue would have decreased compared to a decrease as recorded  operating expenses would have decreased compared to as recorded  and income from operations would have decreased compared to a decrease as recorded during fiscal as compared to fiscal changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue  operating expenses and income from operations in future periods 
we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions  but cannot completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the us dollar 
net revenue for the fiscal year ended january  decreased as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year due to a decrease in license and other revenue  which was partially offset by a increase in maintenance revenue 
we experienced decreases in net revenue in emea  apac and the americas during fiscal as compared to fiscal we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions  including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively  tech data 
tech data accounted for of our consolidated net revenue during both fiscal year and 
table of contents our total spend  defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses  decreased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  exceeding our reduction of total spend goals 
while the magnitude of the savings is significant  we also continued to invest throughout the year in areas important to the future success of autodesk 
our total spend of  million for fiscal included million of stock based compensation expenses  million for restructuring charges  million attributable to amortization of developed technology for acquisitions subsequent to december  million attributable to amortization of customer relationships and trademarks for acquisitions subsequent to december  and for our goodwill impairment 
our total operating margin decreased from of revenue during fiscal to of revenue during fiscal the decrease during fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in our net revenue without an equivalent decrease in costs  as well as an increase in costs associated with charges for stock based compensation and restructuring charges 
our operating margin was reduced percentage points for stock based compensation expenses  percentage point for amortization of developed technology  and percentage point for restructuring charges 
offsetting these decreases to the operating margin were a percentage point increase in operating margin attributable to lower impairment of goodwill and intangibles  and a percentage point increase due to lower charges from acquisition related in process research and development expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal marketing and sales  research and development  and general and administrative expenses decreased during the fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of our cost saving initiatives 
the reduction in costs did not occur as rapidly as the decline in net revenue during fiscal  and our operating margins suffered as a result 
we expect our operating margin percentage to increase during fiscal  as compared to fiscal due to lower restructuring charges  goodwill impairment and stock based compensation expenses 
excluding these items  our operating margin percentage is expected to increase to percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal as compared to fiscal  we expect fiscal operating expenses will decrease  however  there can be no assurance that our cost structure will not increase in the future or that we will be able to align our cost structure with our actual financial results 
in addition  in taking actions to manage our cost structure  we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities 
our primary goals for fiscal are to continue delivering our market leading products and solutions to our customers  stimulate revenue growth  manage operating margins and invest in product functionality and new product lines while minimizing the impact of these investments on gross profit  operating margins  operating cash flow and our worldwide operations 
at january   we had  million in cash and marketable securities 
we completed fiscal with lower deferred revenue balance and a lower accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal our deferred revenue balance at january  included million of customer maintenance contracts  which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts  which is predominantly one year 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal comparatively  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal 
table of contents results of operations net revenue fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions net revenue license and other maintenance net revenue by geographic area americas europe  middle east and africa asia pacific net revenue by operating segment platform solutions and emerging business architecture  engineering and construction manufacturing media and entertainment other fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue license and other revenue license and other revenue is comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue 
product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses  upgrades and crossgrades 
other revenue consists of revenue from advanced systems  consulting and training services  autodesk collaborative solution hosting  and our former location services division 
we divested the location services division in february total license and other revenue decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal license and other revenue from horizontal design and vertical design products decreased and license and other revenue from model based design products decreased  each as compared to the prior fiscal year 
these decreases were primarily due to the decrease in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  percentage points of the decrease was due to decreases in the number of seats sold  and percentage points was due to lower average net revenue per seat 
as a percentage of total net revenue  license and other revenue was and for fiscal and  respectively 
commercial new seat revenue  as a percentage of license and other revenue  was and for fiscal and  respectively 
also contributing to the decrease in license and other revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the decrease in upgrade revenue  which includes crossgrade revenue 
the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily by the recent global economic contraction 
additionally  upgrade revenue was 
table of contents lower during fiscal because of the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocad based products  as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocad based products during fiscal  due to a higher percentage of customers on our maintenance program  which includes unspecified upgrades when and if available 
over the long term  we expect revenue from upgrades to decrease as we continue to move customers onto our maintenance program 
revenue from the sales of our services  training and support  included in license and other revenue  represented less than of net revenue for all periods presented 
maintenance revenue our maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the subscription program 
our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts 
under our maintenance program  customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available  downloadable training courses and online support 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods 
maintenance revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in commercial maintenance revenue 
the increase in commercial maintenance revenue is due to percentage points from higher net revenue per maintenance seat  partially offset by percentage points from lower program enrollment due to the economic downturn 
commercial maintenance revenue represented of maintenance revenue for both fiscal and changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in maintenance billings because we recognize the revenue ratably over the life of the maintenance contracts  which is predominantly one year 
our increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflects an increase in maintenance billings in fiscal as compared to fiscal  partially offset by a decline in maintenance billings in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of total net revenue  maintenance revenue was and for fiscal and  respectively 
total program enrollment at january  consisted of about million users 
the number of users increased from million at january  to million at january  primarily due to a one time adjustment of million educational seats for users who were migrated to a standard educational maintenance plan during the second fiscal quarter ended july  these users were not previously captured in our maintenance installed base prior to the second quarter of fiscal we do not believe these additional seats will have a material impact on our future maintenance revenue 
maintenance billings declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this decrease was due to fewer new seats sold and a decrease in renewal rates as customers have reduced their work force 
the year over year growth in billings for maintenance contracts began to slow in the second quarter of fiscal  although maintenance billings increased slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognize the revenue ratably over the life of the maintenance contracts  which is predominantly one year  but may also be two or three year terms 
this year over year decrease in maintenance billings will cause downward pressure on future maintenance revenue  however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount  timing and mix of contract terms of future maintenance billings 
aggregate backlog at january  and january  was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  represented deferred revenue 
backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter increased by million during fiscal from million at january  to million at january  deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue 
to a lesser extent  deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services  consulting services and deferred license sales 
backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

table of contents net revenue by geographic area net revenue in the americas geography decreased by both as reported and on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from new seats  partially offset by a increase in upgrade revenue in the americas during fiscal as compared to fiscal maintenance revenue growth was flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal growth in the americas continues to be affected by a economic volatility that impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal net revenue in the emea geography decreased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in new seat revenue and a decrease in revenue from upgrades 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in maintenance revenue in emea during fiscal as compared to fiscal the emea geography s decline in revenue during fiscal was primarily due to economic contraction in virtually all countries in that geography 
the decrease in our revenue in that geography was led by emerging economy countries followed by germany  france  italy and the united kingdom 
the negative effect of the stronger value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the british pound and other european currencies also contributed to the decrease in net revenue in emea 
net revenue in the apac geography decreased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in new seat revenue and a decrease in upgrade revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in maintenance revenue 
net revenue contraction in the apac geography during fiscal occurred in virtually all countries  led by japan and followed by china  south korea  india and australia 
revenue from emerging economies decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from emerging economies represented and of net revenue during fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease contributed to our international sales contraction during fiscal we believe that international net revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue 
the recent economic contractions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected  and could continue to significantly affect  our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue 
international net revenue represented of our net revenue in fiscal and of our net revenue in fiscal net revenue by operating segment we have four reportable segments platform solutions and emerging business pseb  architecture  engineering and construction aec  manufacturing mfg and media and entertainment m e 
location services lbs  which we disposed of in february  is not included in any of the above reportable segments and is reflected as other 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we reorganized our business to better align with our customers and accelerate product innovation 
as part of this change there has been some product movement between business segments  including the movement of geospatial and process and power design market products from pseb to aec 
certain reclassifications to segment revenue and gross profit have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation 
we have no material inter segment revenue 
net revenue for pseb decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our autocad lt products and a decrease in revenue from our autocad products  offset by a net increase in revenue from all other pseb products and services

fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  net revenue increased 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we experienced a dramatic change in the economic conditions of our markets globally 
the first two quarters of fiscal were characterized by net revenue growth of over the same period in the prior fiscal year 
due to the deteriorating global economic conditions during our third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal  our results for the second half of fiscal were a stark contrast to the first half of the fiscal year 
revenue for the second half of fiscal declined by compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year  revenue decreased sequentially and during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
license and other revenue total license and other revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal commercial new seat revenue from our model based  horizontal and vertical design products for fiscal was flat compared to fiscal during fiscal  we experienced a decrease of approximately percentage points due to lower number of seat licenses sold  offset by an increase of approximately percentage points due to higher average net revenue per seat 
during fiscal  there was less correlation between revenue growth and seat license growth due to changes in our mix of geographies and products  proportion of maintenance in the user base  currency exchange rates  and average selling prices  and we expect this trend to continue 
as a percentage of total net revenue  license and other revenue was for fiscal and for fiscal upgrade revenue  which includes crossgrade revenue  decreased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as expected 
the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocad based products in fiscal as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocad based products in fiscal  due to more customers on our maintenance program 
maintenance revenue maintenance revenue increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal approximately percentage points of the increase was due to increases in program enrollment and approximately percentage points of the increase was due to higher net revenue per maintenance seat for fiscal as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of total net revenue  maintenance revenue was for fiscal and for fiscal at january  our maintenance program enrollment consisted of about million users 

table of contents net revenue by geographic area net revenue in the americas geography decreased by both as reported and on a constant currency basis during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as a result of a decrease in revenue from new seats in the americas geography and a decrease in revenue from upgrades  offset in part by a increase in maintenance revenue 
growth in the americas geography was affected by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in fiscal net revenue in emea geography increased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in maintenance revenue and a increase in new seat revenue  slightly offset by a decrease in revenue from upgrades 
the emea geography s growth during fiscal was primarily due to growth in the emea emerging economies  as well as in germany  france  switzerland  italy  belgium and sweden 
the positive effect of the weaker value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the british pound and other european currencies also contributed to the increase in net revenue in the emea geography

international net revenue represented of our net revenue in fiscal and of our net revenue in fiscal we started to experience some economic difficulty in international sales in the third quarter of fiscal global conditions worsened  and the economic downturn significantly impacted our international sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  particularly the robust business we had been seeing in emerging economies 
net revenue in emerging economies grew by from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to revenue from the russian federation  other emea emerging economies and india 
this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal in contrast  fourth quarter fiscal net revenue in the emea and apac geographies decreased and  respectively  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  and net revenue from emerging economies declined for the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year

table of contents cost of revenue fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions cost of revenue license and other maintenance as a percentage of net revenue cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs of fulfilling service contracts and order fulfillment  including stock based compensation expense for those employees  direct material and overhead charges  amortization of purchased technology  professional services fees and royalties 
direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pc based workstations for advanced systems in our m e segment  costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media  printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 
cost of license and other revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in license and other revenue 
cost of license and other revenue did not decline as rapidly as the associated net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of increased amortization of purchased technology related to fiscal years and acquisitions  costs associated with redundant services as we migrated a portion of our it systems onto a new platform  and higher costs associated with the implementation of our electronic fulfillment system 
cost of license and other revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal even though license and other revenue decreased by 
cost of license and other revenue increased in fiscal due to an increase in amortization of purchased technology due to the number of acquisitions completed during fiscal years and  slightly offset by decreases in employee related expenses 
since many of these costs are headcount related expenses  they do not vary proportionally with changes in revenue 
cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers  including stock based compensation expense for these employees  rent and occupancy  and professional services fees 
cost of maintenance revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in product support headcount due to the acquisition of moldflow corporation in the second quarter of fiscal costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively consistent in both relative dollars and as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue  at least over the near term  is affected by the volume and mix of product sales  fluctuations in consulting costs  amortization of purchased technology  new customer support offerings  royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products  and employee stock based compensation expense 
marketing and sales fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions marketing and sales as a percentage of net revenue 
table of contents marketing and sales expenses include salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees  costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows and expositions  and various sales and promotional programs 
marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing  rent and occupancy  sales and dealer commissions  and the cost of supplies and equipment 
marketing and sales expenses decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower employee related costs  driven by decreased marketing and sales headcount and decreased travel expenditures and reduced advertising and promotional expenses 
marketing and sales expense increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher employee related costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount in fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our need to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition 
research and development fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions research and development as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation expense for research and development employees  rent and occupancy  professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors  and the expense of travel  entertainment and training for such personnel 
research and development expenses decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreases in employee related costs driven by decreased research and development headcount 
also contributing to the decline was a decrease in acquisition related in process research and development charges from fiscal to fiscal research and development expenses increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in employee related costs driven by increased research and development headcount 
also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was in process research and development from acquisitions during fiscal these increases were partially offset by a reduction in stock based compensation expense for our research and development employees

general and administrative expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to decreases in employee related costs driven by decreased general and administrative headcount and reduced rent and occupancy costs due to the consolidation of facilities 
this decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures from fiscal and general and administrative expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increases in employee related costs  due to an increase in general and administrative headcount  and an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 
table of contents restructuring fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions restructuring as a percentage of net revenue percentage is not meaningful in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs 
this program reduced the number of employees by a total of approximately positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately leased facilities 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we initiated an additional restructuring program  which resulted in headcount reduction of approximately positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately leased facilities around the world in order to further reduce our operating expenses 
in connection with these restructuring programs  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million and million during fiscal and of these amounts  million and million were recorded for one time termination benefits and other costs during fiscal and  respectively  and million and million were recorded for facilities related costs during fiscal and  respectively 
the one time termination benefits for these two restructuring programs have been substantially paid as of january  we expect to pay the facility related liabilities through fiscal see note  restructuring reserve  in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
impairment of goodwill and intangibles fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions impairment of goodwill and intangibles as a percentage of net revenue percentage is not meaningful we recorded an impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal representing the entire goodwill balance of our m e segment as of april  this goodwill balance related to our m e segment s fourth quarter fiscal acquisition of substantially all of the assets of softimage 
in may  we concluded that an impairment of goodwill had occurred as of april  due to revisions to our revenue and cash flow projections in response to the significant and sustained revenue declines we were experiencing in all segments and geographies in the first quarter of fiscal the revenue and cash flow projections were substantially impacted for all segments  and our m e segment was the only segment which had a fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its net assets 
during fiscal we recorded a million impairment charge affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily related to impairment of goodwill associated with our m e segment 
during the three months ended january   revenue and cash flow projections for all segments decreased substantially as the economy worsened 
our m e segment was the only segment which had a fair value that fell below the carrying value of its net assets 

table of contents should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future  additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill 
as of january   a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill  nor result in impairment of goodwill

the increase in interest and other income  net during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily due to gains on marketable securities  gains on foreign currency transactions  a gain on the sale of an investment  and the impairment of an investment during fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower interest rate yields on investments during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in interest and investment income  net  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily due to lower interest rate yields 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates and the establishment of the california valuation allowance in fiscal offset by non deductible goodwill impairment and in process research and development expenses in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the state of california enacted legislation significantly altering california tax law 
as a result of the newly enacted legislation  we expect that in fiscal years and beyond  income subject to tax in california will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly  deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized 
our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to non deductible goodwill impairment and in process research and development expenses 
our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits  state income taxes  the tax impact of stock based compensation  accounting for uncertain tax positions  business combinations  us manufacturer s deduction  closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits  changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax law 

table of contents at january   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products 
our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as general operating expenses for marketing  facilities and overhead costs 
in addition to operating expenses  we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives  which include acquisitions of products  technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program 
see further discussion of these items below 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  million and net accounts receivable of in addition  we have a line of credit facility that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to million and a china line of credit that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to million 
these line of credit agreements contain customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets  and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain their financial covenants 
these credit facilities are available for working capital and other business needs 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding on the us or china line of credit 
the us facility expires in august and the china facility has no contractual expiration 
as of march   no amounts were outstanding on the us and china line of credit facilities 
our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally 
our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates citibank 
in addition  citicorp usa  inc  an affiliate of citibank  is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of our million us line of credit 
the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from million at january  to  million at january  is principally the result of cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
these increases to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock  repayment of our lines of credit  capital expenditures  the acquisition of planplatform and equity investments 
cash generated from operations was negatively impacted by lower net revenue and the payment of restructuring charges 
at january   our short term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of million and a cost basis of million 
the portfolio fair value consisted of million invested in commercial paper and corporate securities  million invested in mutual funds  million invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than days and less than one year  million invested in money market funds  million invested in us government agency securities and million invested in municipal securities and other securities 
at january   we had an investment in the reserve international liquidity fund the international fund  a market fund with an estimated fair value of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the international fund ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below per share 
this occurred as a result of the international fund revaluing its holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers  which filed for chapter bankruptcy on september   and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the international fund 
our investment in the international fund is unrelated to the assets of our deferred compensation plan 

table of contents a third party court appointed supervisor is overseeing  but not managing  the accounting and payment administration of the non us based international fund 
our investment in the international fund is not currently liquid  and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so 
however  based on currently available information  we expect to recover substantially all of our current holdings  net of reserves  from the international fund within the next months 
accordingly  the investment in the international fund is classified in current marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  at january   we owned two auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of million 
our auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that were structured to reset at auction every days 
the securities  which met our investment guidelines at the time the investments were made  have failed to settle in auctions since august and have earned a premium interest rate since that time 
while we expect to recover substantially all of our current holdings  net of reserves  in the auction rate securities  we cannot predict when this will occur or the amount we will receive 
due to the lack of liquidity of these investments  they are included in non current marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note  financial instruments and hedging activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financial instruments 
at january   million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note  deferred compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was net income increased by the effect of non cash expenses associated with depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and impairment of goodwill 
the primary working capital source of cash was a decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable relates primarily to the increase in collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was days at january  the primary working capital uses of cash were for payment of restructuring related costs  the reduction of deferred revenue due to lower maintenance billings for fiscal compared to fiscal and reductions of accrued expenses primarily related to our fiscal employee bonus accrual and fourth quarter fiscal commissions 
we expect net cash flows provided by operating activities to be higher in fiscal than in fiscal due to improved operating margins 
long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following stock repurchases  the acquisition of businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to our business  capital expenditures  including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications  and funding restructuring costs 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal in the event of a further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next months 
our existing us credit facility is currently million of which we have no amounts outstanding 
this credit facility is available for working capital and other business needs 
our revenue  earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes derivative instruments to hedge a majority of our foreign currency transaction exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
as of january   we have open contracts to hedge expected cash flows for one to twelve months in the future 
contracts are primarily denominated in euros  japanese yen  swiss francs  british pounds and canadian dollars 
we do not enter into any 
table of contents derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years thereafter in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations pension obligations restructuring obligations other obligations total other obligations include future sabbatical obligations and asset retirement obligations 
this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  certain purchase obligations as discussed below  long term deferred revenue and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions  since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities  net of sublease income  computer equipment and other equipment leases 
purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements  it infrastructure costs  marketing costs and contractual software development services 
deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
see note deferred compensation  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 
pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note  retirement benefit plans  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 
restructuring obligations relate to our fiscal  and other restructuring plans 
see note  restructuring reserves  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or 
table of contents other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
in addition  we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
royalty expense  included in cost of license and other revenue  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees  including limited product warranties 
historically  costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant  but because potential future costs are highly variable  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 
issuer purchases of equity securities our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the cumulative repurchase of up to million shares 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders 
the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors  including general market conditions  the volume of employee stock option exercises  the trading price of our common stock  cash on hand and available in the us  and company defined trading windows 
there were million repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended january   during the year ended january  we repurchased million shares of our common stock 
at january   million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization 
this program does not have a fixed expiration date 
see note  stockholder equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities 
as of january  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our revenue  earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
as of january  and  we had open contracts to hedge expected cash flows for one to months in the future in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility 
contracts were primarily denominated in euros  japanese yen  swiss francs  british pounds and canadian dollars 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
we utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions 
a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  indicated that a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january  would increase the fair value of our contracts by million 
a hypothetical depreciation of the 
table of contents dollar from its value at january  would decrease the fair value of our contracts by million 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency contracts 
interest rate risk interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and  to a lesser extent  the market value of certain longer term securities 
at january   we had million of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
with an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately million  if interest rates were to increase decrease by  this would result in a million increase decrease in annual interest income 
further  at january   we had approximately million invested in a longer term portfolio which  with and basis point moves  would result in market value changes gains or losses of million over both six and month periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk
