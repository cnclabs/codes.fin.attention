md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated audited financial statements and accompanying notes 
this overview summarizes the md a  which includes the following sections our business a general description of the key drivers that affect our business and the industries in which we operate 
our business strategy a description of the strategic initiatives on which we focus and the goals we seek to achieve 
results of operations an analysis of the company s results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  currency exchange and an overview of our financial position 
contractual obligations an analysis of contracts entered into in the normal course of business that will require future payments 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies a description of critical accounting policies including those that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our business the company is a medical device company 
through continuous improvement and development of our people  our mission is to design  manufacture and market innovative microsurgical devices and consumables of the highest quality in order to assist and enable surgeons who perform microsurgery around the world to provide a better quality of life for their patients 
the company s primary focus is on the microsurgical disciplines of ophthalmology and neurosurgery 
our distribution channels include a combination of direct and independent sales organizations and important strategic alliances with market leaders 
the company s product lines focus upon precision engineered  microsurgical  handheld devices and the microscopic delivery of laser energy  ultrasound  electrosurgery  aspiration  illumination and irrigation  often delivered in multiple combinations 
enterprise wide sales information is included in note to the consolidated audited financial statements 
new product sales the company s business strategy has been  and is expected to continue to be  the development  manufacture and marketing of new technologies for microsurgery applications including the ophthalmic and neurosurgical markets 
new products  which management defines as products first available for sale within the prior month period  accounted for approximately million  or percent  of total sales for the company for fiscal for fiscal  new products accounted for approximately million  or percent  of total sales for the company 
these new product sales were primarily in our disposable products both in the ophthalmic and marketing partners markets 
the company s past revenue growth has been closely aligned with the adoption by surgeons of new technologies introduced by the company 
since august   the company has introduced new catalogue items to the ophthalmic and neurosurgical markets 
we expect adoption rates for the company s new products in the future to have a positive effect on its operating performance 
growth in minimally invasive surgery procedures minimally invasive surgery is surgery performed without making a major incision or opening 
minimally invasive surgery generally results in less patient trauma  decreased likelihood of complications related to the incision and a shorter recovery time 
a growing number of surgical procedures are performed using minimally invasive techniques  creating a multi billion dollar market for the specialized devices used in the procedures 
based on our micro instrumentation capability  we believe we are ideally positioned to take advantage of this growing market 
the company has developed scissors having a single activating shaft as small as gauge inch  millimeter in diameter 
this product was developed for ophthalmology but has wide ranging minimally invasive surgical applications 
the company s malis line of electrosurgical bipolar generators is the market share leader in neurosurgical generators worldwide 
these generators produce a unique and patented waveform that has been developed and refined over many decades and has proven to cause less collateral tissue damage as compared to other competing generators 
the sonopet power ultrasound system technology now owned by stryker provides a different method for the minimally invasive removal of soft and fibrotic tissue  as well as bone removal through the use of ultrasonic tips provided by the company to stryker 
the company has benefited from the overall growth in this market and expects to continue to benefit as stryker introduces new and improved technologies targeting this market 
demand trends the company s sales declined percent during the fiscal year ended july  compared with the previous fiscal year 
the two most significant factors impacting this decrease were a million decrease in sales due to the transitioning of our neurosurgery sales to our marketing partners and a million  or percent  decrease in capital equipment sales 
these decreases were primarily offset by the growth in our disposable product sales of million  or percent 
a study performed for the company by market scope llc predicts a steady growth of percent per year in vitrectomy surgery worldwide 
neurosurgical procedures on a global basis continue to rise at an estimated percent growth rate driven by an aging global population  new technologies  advances in surgical techniques and a growing global market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries  among other factors 
in addition  the demand for high quality products and new technologies  such as the company s innovative devices and disposables  to support growth in procedures volume continues to positively impact growth 
the company believes innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly impact the ophthalmic and neurosurgical market 
pricing trends through its strategy of delivering new and higher quality technologies  the company has generally been able to maintain the average selling prices for its products in the face of downward pressure in the healthcare industry 
however  increased competition in the market for the company s capital equipment market segments  in combination with customer budget constraints and capital scarcity  has in some instances negatively impacted the company s selling prices on these devices 
economic trends economic conditions may continue to negatively impact capital expenditures at the hospital or surgical center and doctor level 
further  economic conditions in the united states negatively impacted the volume of the company s capital equipment sales during fiscal this was a contributing factor in the company s percent decrease in sales during the fiscal year as compared to a growth rate of approximately percent in the fiscal year 
our business strategy the company s key strategy is to enhance shareholder value through profitable revenue growth in ophthalmology and neurosurgery markets through the identification and development of reusable and disposable devices in conjunction with leading surgeons and marketing partners and to build out a strong operational infrastructure and financial foundation within which prudently financed growth opportunities can be realized and implemented 
at the same time  we will maintain vigilance and sensitivity to new challenges which may arise from changes in the definition and delivery of appropriate healthcare in our fields of interest 
in fiscal  our driving strategic priorities are to drive the company onto a different growth trajectory and to continue to enhance the profitability of our operational platform by focusing on manufacturing efficiencies

results of operations year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales the following table presents net sales by category dollars in thousands fiscal year ended july  increase decrease ophthalmic direct neurosurgery marketing partners  n m total neurosurgery oem other total ophthalmic sales grew percent in fiscal compared to fiscal domestic ophthalmic sales decreased percent  while international ophthalmic sales increased percent primarily due to sales of disposable products 
direct neurosurgery sales fell million  or percent  to million in fiscal compared with fiscal this decline in neurosurgery sales was the result of the transition to codman and stryker under new marketing partner agreements during fiscal new sales to our domestic marketing partners comprised million of sales in fiscal  partially offsetting the loss in neurosurgery sales 
total neurosurgery sales including marketing partners declined million  or percent 
total oem sales fell percent to million compared with million in fiscal the two most significant factors impacting the decrease in our sales during fiscal were the transition of our direct neurosurgery sales to our marketing partners which resulted in a million decrease in our net sales and the significant decline in our capital equipment sales of approximately million  or percent  which came from hospitals tightly controlling their capital expenditure budgets during the fiscal year 
these decreases were primarily offset by the growth in our disposable product sales of million  or percent 
the following table presents domestic and international net sales dollars in thousands fiscal year ended july  decrease united states including sales to marketing partners international including canada total domestic and international sales decreased and percent  respectively 
sales of domestic ophthalmology decreased percent  while international ophthalmology sales increased percent 
domestic neurosurgery sales decreased percent and international neurosurgery sales decreased percent 
sales to our marketing partners represented million in sales during fiscal  partially offsetting the loss of neurosurgery sales 
our international ophthalmic sales force at july  included direct employees and approximately non us distributors and independent sales representatives covering countries 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal increased approximately percentage points 
there were several factors which impacted the gross profit margin increase in fiscal the elimination of a non recurring  fourth quarter write off in fiscal of inventory primarily due to excess and discontinued inventory  and improved absorption of both labor and overhead deriving from our lean manufacturing initiative  partially offset by the change in our sales mix arising from the increase in our international ophthalmic sales and from transitioning our neurosurgery product sales to our marketing partners 
the company continues to realize incremental savings from the lean manufacturing initiative and will continue to develop its internal resources to expand the lean initiative throughout the entire organization 
operating expenses fiscal year ended july  july  july  r d expenditures in thousands percentage of net sales r d costs remained flat at million when compared to fiscal as of july   there were active  major projects in various stages of completion 
the company s r d investment is driven by the opportunities to develop new products to meet the needs of its surgeon customers  and reflecting the need to keep such spending in line with what the company can afford to spend 
this results in an investment rate that is comparable to such spending by other medical device companies 
the company expects over the next few years to invest in r d at a rate of approximately to percent of net sales 
however  in fiscal  the r d investment rate may decline as development revenue from certain new products being developed with stryker s ultrasonic aspirator products will offset some of the company s internal r d expenses 
selling expenses  which consist of salaries  commissions and direct expenses  decreased approximately million to million  or percent of sales  for the fiscal year ended july   compared to million  or percent of net sales  for the fiscal year ended july  in july  the company completed a reduction in personnel of approximately percent of its workforce including most of its direct neurosurgical sales force 
this realignment was designed to position the company to attain increased profitability through the elimination of a substantial portion of its commercial expenses associated with direct distribution of these neurosurgical products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company eliminated the remaining expenses associated with the direct distribution of its neurosurgical products and as such expects to see another decline in its selling expenses of approximately million during fiscal general and administrative expenses g a decreased by approximately  during the fiscal year ended july  and as a percentage of net sales were percent for the fiscal year ended july  as compared to percent for the fiscal year ended july  the company s legal expenses decreased by  during the fiscal year ended july  compared to the fiscal year ended july  primarily due to elimination of the cost associated with the alcon patent and trademark infringement lawsuit 
the legal expense decrease was partially offset by various other increases 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  and is recognized over the directors and employees requisite service period 
the company will continue to grant options to its independent directors and officers but has begun to use restricted stock to provide incentive compensation for its non officer employees 
as of july   the future compensation cost expected to be recognized is approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal however  the major portion of our compensation cost arises from our stock option grants to our directors  which is recognized pro ratably over the year as the options vest 
as of july   there was approximately  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested restricted stock based compensation arrangements granted under a stock option plan adopted by valley forge in the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of five years  which is generally the vesting period 
other income expense other income in fiscal increased significantly to million compared to an expense of  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the one time impact of the  gain from sale of the omni product line to stryker and the million in settlement gain from alcon 
in addition  interest expense decreased  as the company was able to pay down its lines of credit and other debt with the reductions in the carrying value of inventory  the proceeds from the sale of the omni product line and the settlement proceeds from alcon 
operating income  income taxes and net income operating income for fiscal was million  as compared to operating income of million in the comparable fiscal period 
the increase in operating income was primarily the result of a percent decrease in net sales offset by a percent decrease in cost of goods sold for a net increase in gross profit of  in addition  operating income was favorably impacted by a decrease of million in sales and marketing expenses and a  decrease in g a costs  partially offset by a slight increase in r d costs 
for the fiscal year ended july   the company recorded a million income tax provision on a pre tax income of million  or percent effective tax rate 
for the fiscal year ended july   the company recorded a  income tax provision on pre tax income of million  or percent effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate increased for the fiscal year ended july  due to the increase in pre tax income  causing the relative portion of the provision that is made up by the research and experimentation credit and the manufacturing deduction to decrease 
in addition  the research and experimentation credit expired as of december  net income increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended july   from million for the same period in fiscal basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended july  increased to from for the fiscal year ended july  basic weighted average shares outstanding increased from  at july  to  at july  year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales the following table presents net sales by category dollars in thousands fiscal year ended july  increase decrease ophthalmic direct neurosurgery oem codman  stryker and iridex other total ophthalmic sales growth for fiscal was led by growth in sales of disposable products which includes illumination products  laser probes and sales of new disposable packs 
when comparing neurosurgery  net sales during the fiscal year ended were percent greater than  primarily attributable to the sales of disposable products related to electrosurgical generators and power ultrasonic aspirators 
sales to our oem customers were up percent to million for the fiscal year ending july  primarily due to disposable products sold to codman and iridex and sales of pain control generators to stryker  partially offset by a decrease in capital equipment sold to codman due to the economic environment during fiscal the following table presents domestic and international net sales dollars in thousands year ended july  increase united states including sales to oem customers international including canada total us sales remained relatively flat as the increase in sales of the company s disposable products were offset by decreased sales of its capital products due to the economic recession experienced in fiscal international sales grew percent in the company s core technology areas  including sales of ophthalmic products in direct sales markets  the ultrasonic aspirator  electrosurgical generator and their related disposables 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from fiscal to fiscal was attributable primarily to an increase in sales of percent compared to a cost of goods sold increase of percent 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales from fiscal to fiscal decreased by approximately four percentage points primarily due to the change in mix toward our international products  reduced absorption of both labor and overhead on our capital equipment product lines and a  fourth quarter write off primarily due to excess and discontinued inventory which was either contributed to a charitable organization or was discarded 
operating expenses r d costs as a percentage of net sales were percent and percent for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
r d costs increased approximately  to million in compared to million in the increase in r d costs was primarily due to the direct costs associated with active  major projects in various stages of completion at july  selling expenses  which consist of salaries  commissions and direct expenses  increased approximately million to million  or percent of sales  for the fiscal year ended july   compared to million  or percent of net sales  for the fiscal year ended july  the increase in sales expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to commissions paid on a percent increase in commissionable sales which excludes sales to our oem customers 
in march  the company eliminated two positions within sales and marketing 
in july  the company completed a reduction in personnel of approximately percent of our workforce including most of our direct neurosurgical sales force 
this realignment was designed to position the company to attain increased profitability through the elimination of a substantial portion of our commercial expenses associated with direct distribution of these neurosurgical products 
g a decreased by approximately  during the fiscal year ended july  and as a percentage of net sales were percent for the fiscal year ended july  as compared to percent for the fiscal year ended july  the company experienced a decrease of approximately  in outside consulting costs on its sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  primarily due to efforts to further internalize documentation processes and procedures

the company s legal expenses increased by  during the fiscal year ended july  compared to the fiscal year ended july  primarily due to the cost associated with the alcon patent and trademark infringement lawsuit 
directors fees increased  due to each independent director serving as the principal executive officer of the company on a weekly rotating basis for the first six months of the fiscal year while the board was conducting a search for a new ceo 
in addition  the directors serving as the principal executive officer also caused salaries and benefits to decrease by approximately  other expense other expense for the fiscal year decreased percent to  from million for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease was primarily due to decreased interest expense for the decreased borrowings on the company s working capital line during the year partially offset by the annual interest expense associated with the iridex settlement 
operating income  income taxes and net income operating income for fiscal was million  as compared to an operating income of million in fiscal the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of a decrease in gross profit margin of approximately four percentage points on percent more net sales  and an increase in r d expenses and selling costs of  and million  respectively  which was partially offset by a  decrease in g a expenses 
for the fiscal year ended july   the company recorded a  income tax provision on a pre tax income of million  or percent effective tax rate 
for the fiscal year ended july   the company recorded a million income tax provision on pre tax income of million  or percent effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate decreased for the fiscal year ended july  due to the decrease in pre tax income  causing the relative portion of the provision that is made up by the research and experimentation credit and the manufacturing deduction to increase 
net income decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended july   from million for the same period in fiscal basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended july  decreased to from for the fiscal year ended july  basic weighted average shares outstanding increased from  at july  to  at july  liquidity and capital resources the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and total interest bearing debt of million as of july  working capital  including the management of inventory and accounts receivable  is a management focus

at july   the company had days of inventory on hand 
the inventory on hand was favorable to july  by days and favorable by days to july  utilizing the trailing twelve months of cost of sales 
although management attained its goal of reducing inventory to million  it is focused on continued maintenance of that goal and will look at other means to reduce its days of inventory on hand even further without impact to its customer service goals 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended july   compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of approximately  for the comparable fiscal period 
the increase of approximately million was primarily attributable to the impact of the settlement proceeds from alcon which were approximately million 
in addition  the increase was attributable to net increases applicable to net income of million  decrease in inventories of million  increases in accounts payable of  and increases in income taxes payable of million offset in part by net decreases applicable primarily to the elimination of the gain on sale of the assets related to the omni product line of  and lower accrued expenses of  cash flows provided by investing activities were  for the year ended july   compared to cash used in investing activities of  for the comparable fiscal period 
during the year ended july   cash additions to property and equipment were million  compared to  for fiscal increases in cash additions in fiscal to property and equipment were primarily due to the purchase of machinery and equipment to meet the increased demand of our marketing partners 
proceeds from the sale of the omni product line were approximately million during the fiscal year ended july  cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the year ended july   compared to cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended july  the increase of million was attributable primarily to the decrease in net borrowings on the lines of credit of million and principal payments on revenue bonds payable and long term debt of million

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition the company records revenue from product sales when the revenue is realized and the product is shipped from its facilities 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed and determinable  delivery to the carrier has occurred  and collectability is reasonably ensured 
freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales  and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales 
sales tax billed to customers is included as a liability as products are shipped 
the terms and conditions of sales to both our domestic and international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the service has been completed 
revenue from licenses  extended warranty contracts and royalty fees is recorded when earned 
deferred revenue on april   the company entered into a settlement and license agreement with alcon pursuant to which alcon paid to the company million 
the net proceeds were million after contingency payments to attorneys 
the company recognized a gain from this agreement of million in the third fiscal quarter 
the remaining million has been accounted for as an up front license fee under the settlement and license agreement and will be deferred and recognized as earned over a period of up to fifteen years based upon the units shipped to alcon under a supply agreement entered pursuant to the settlement 
significant and unanticipated changes to the forecasted unit volume over the life of the agreement or changes in the expected contribution margins associated with these products could change the timing of the revenue recognized under this agreement 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
the company s inventory is very dynamic and new products are added frequently 
thus  the company reviews the valuation of its inventory on a quarterly basis and determines if a valuation allowance is necessary for items that have not had their values updated recently 
in addition  the company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence quarterly 
the company s evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future cost valuations  future demand or market conditions are different from the company s projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
amortization periods the company records amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
it bases the determination of these useful lives on the period over which it expects the related assets to contribute to its cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if the company s assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  it may change future amortization expense see impairment of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to the company  the company records an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that management reasonably expects to collect 
for all other customers  the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  historical experience and credit insurance 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  the company may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
patents and research and development incremental legal and other costs to obtain patents are capitalized to a patent asset 
salaries  benefits and other direct costs of product development are expensed as operating expenses in r d costs 
patents are amortized to operations under the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining statutory life of the patent or the cash flow stream associated with that patent 
goodwill as of july   we have recorded million of goodwill 
we perform purchase price allocations including recognition of intangible assets when we make a business combination 
the excess of the purchase price after the allocation of fair values to tangible assets and identifiable intangibles is allocated to goodwill 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized and whether the assets have finite or indefinite lives for amortization purposes 
currently  we have one reporting unit 
we perform our annual impairment test on goodwill in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc absent any impairment indicators  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the company performs its impairment tests during the fourth fiscal quarter 
our tests may include three approaches to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
the first approach is discounted cash flows  which focuses on our expected cash flows available for common equity owners 
net cash flows to equity is defined as our earnings plus depreciation  amortization and interest expense or ebitda less our estimated usage of cash for debt  capital expenditures and working capital changes 
the resulting net cash flows and the terminal value our value of invested capital at the end of the five year projection period are then discounted to derive an indication of the present value of the company s invested capital 
interest bearing debt is then subtracted to arrive at the company s fair value of equity 
this valuation method is dependent upon management s assumptions made regarding future cash flow and cash requirements and the discount factor used to determine the present value of our future cash flows 
if necessary  we would also analyze two additional valuation methods the guideline company approach and the market capitalization approach 
the guideline company approach focuses on comparing the company to selected reasonably similar  publicly traded companies 
under this approach  valuation multiples are i derived from operating data of selected similar companies  ii evaluated and adjusted based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to this selected group of guideline companies  and iii applied to our revenues and ebitda to arrive at an indication of invested capital 
interest bearing debt is subtracted and a control premium and cash balances are added to arrive at the fair value of the company s equity 
this valuation approach is dependent upon the assumption that our value can be evaluated by analysis of our earnings and strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected similar companies and an appropriate control premium can be determined 
the market capitalization approach focuses on the company s market capitalization over a period of time and applies a control premium to arrive at an indication of fair value 
this valuation approach is dependent upon the performance of our stock and the control premiums utilized in acquisitions completed in the healthcare equipment and supplies industry 
the fair value determined under the discounted cash flows methodology in fiscal resulted in an indication of value which exceeded the book value of the reporting unit by approximately percent 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions or the company s operating performance could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
other intangibles as of july   we have recorded million of indefinite lived intangible assets for the malis trademark 
the life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark or the life of the business entity owning the trademark 
the company intends to use the trademark indefinitely  and therefore  its useful life is not limited to any specific product 
we perform impairment tests on the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually at the end of july or sooner if we identify an event suggesting possible impairment of the value of this asset 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment using the discounted cash flow methodology  which focuses on our expected cash flows derived from the use of the intangible asset 
with respect to the trademark  the expected cash flows are reduced by the related income taxes and debt 
the indication of value for the trademark exceeds its book value by approximately percent as of july  significant and unanticipated changes to either the market for the malis banded products or our contract authorizing the use of the malis trademark could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc topic also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if its more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset not be realized 
in our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income in our tax jurisdictions and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from these assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance  we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period this determination is made 
at july   we had deferred tax assets related to net foreign operating loss carryforwards with a tax value of million 
these net foreign operating loss carryforwards have various expiration dates  depending on the country and period in which they occurred 
the company has not established a valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets based upon projected future taxable income  the expiration dates of these carryforwards and various tax planning strategies 
in addition  the calculations of our tax liabilities involve dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulation 
on august   we adopted the provisions of asc topic related to uncertain tax positions 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of certain outcomes 
we reevaluate these positions on a quarterly basis including an analysis of changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues or net audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of an additional charge to the tax provision 
stock based compensation the company utilizes fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation in accounting for its employee stock options 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the directors and employees requisite service period 
compensation expense is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
of the inputs into the black scholes option pricing model  the one that can impact the value of the options the most is the volatility factor 
for awards occurring in fiscal year ended july   the company has utilized a volatility factor of percent in this calculation 
in addition  the company utilized an expected average risk free interest rate of percent  an expected average life of years and no expected dividends 
recent accounting pronouncements information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated audited financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate variability 
the company has million in cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion of this cash held in short term money market funds bearing interest at basis points
