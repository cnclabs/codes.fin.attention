the selected historical financial data reflect the ongoing impact of the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement that our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed on january  in connection with our assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  pursuant to legislation passed in the nevada legislature 
upon entry into the lpt agreement  we recorded as a liability a deferred reinsurance gain which we amortize over the period during which underlying reinsured claims are paid 
we record adjustments to the direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement based on our periodic reevaluations of these reserves

for  the pro forma earnings per common share basic was calculated using the net income for the months ended december   as presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the weighted average shares outstanding was calculated using those shares available to eligible members in the conversion  or  shares  for the period prior to the ipo  and the actual weighted shares outstanding for the period after the ipo 
earnings per common share diluted is based on the pro forma weighted shares outstanding basic adjusted by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive common shares been issued and reduced by the number of common shares that could have been purchased from the proceeds of the potentially dilutive shares 
the company s outstanding options have been excluded in computing the diluted earnings per share for the pro forma year ended december   because their inclusion would be anti dilutive 
although there were  dilutive potential common shares at december   they did not impact the pro forma earnings per share number as shown 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
for the years and prior  the pro forma earnings per common share basic and diluted is presented to depict the impact of our conversion described above  as prior to the conversion we did not have any outstanding common shares 
the pro forma earnings per common share basic and diluted was computed using only the shares of the our common stock issued to eligible members in the conversion  and does not include any shares issued to new investors in connection with the our initial public offering or the impact of the cash elections made by eligible members 
we had no common stock equivalents outstanding for the periods presented prior to that would create a dilutive effect on pro forma earnings per share 
on september   we changed our method of recording ecic written premiums to an annual method 
as a result  the method of calculating   and written premiums has been conformed for this change to be comparable to written premiums 
the gross and net premiums written for all periods presented are calculated assuming the written premiums are of the estimated annual premium 
historically  written premiums for ecic were recorded using a billed method  where premiums were recorded at the time policy installments were billed 
gross premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums written and assumed premiums written before the effect of ceded reinsurance and the intercompany pooling agreement 
direct premiums written are the premiums on all policies our insurance subsidiaries have issued during the year 
assumed premiums written are premiums that our insurance subsidiaries have received from any authorized state mandated pools and a previous fronting facility 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
net premiums written is the sum of direct premiums written and assumed premiums written less ceded premiums written 
ceded premiums written is the portion of direct premiums written that we cede to our reinsurers under our reinsurance contracts 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
losses and lae ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and lae to net premiums earned 
commission expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of commission expense to net premiums earned 
dividends to policyholders ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of dividends to policyholders expense to net premium earned 
underwriting and other operating expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of underwriting and other operating expense to net premiums earned 
combined ratio is the sum of the losses and lae ratio  the commission expense ratio  dividends to policyholders ratio and the underwriting and other operating expense ratio 
because we only have one operating segment  holding company expenses are included in the combined ratio 
in connection with our january  assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement with third party reinsurers  which substantially reduced exposure to losses for pre july  nevada insured risks

under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income

for and prior  we define pro forma earnings per share basic and diluted before impact of the lpt agreement as net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement divided by the common shares issued in our conversion 
these are not measurements of financial performance under gaap  but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory and gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
we present pro forma earnings per share basic and diluted before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of performance by outstanding common share issued in our conversion 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits and consequently we believe these presentations are useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe these non gaap measures  as we have defined them  are helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the item excluded has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations

there is a corresponding change to the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses as well as the deferred reinsurance gain 
a cumulative adjustment to the amortization of the deferred gain is also then recognized in earnings so that the deferred reinsurance gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the lpt agreement 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
we define total equity including deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement as total equity plus deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement 
total equity including deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement is not a measurement of financial position under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to total equity or any other measure of financial health derived in accordance with gaap 
we present total equity including deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of financial position to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction and the treatment of the deferred gain does not result in ongoing cash benefits or charges to our current operations and consequently we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our financial position

in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in item a of this report 
our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including the risks described in the sections entitled risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a specialty provider of workers compensation insurance focused on select small businesses engaged in low to medium hazard industries 
workers compensation is a statutory system under which an employer is required to pay for its employees medical  disability and vocational rehabilitation and death benefit costs for work related injuries or illnesses 
our business has historically targeted businesses located in several western states  primarily california and nevada 
during  we were the ninth and fourteenth largest non governmental writer of workers compensation insurance in california and the united states  respectively  based on direct premiums written  as reported by am best 
we operate as a single segment 
we believe we benefit by targeting small businesses  a market that is characterized by fewer competitors  more attractive pricing and strong persistency when compared to the us workers compensation insurance industry in general 
as a result of our disciplined underwriting standards  we believe we are able to price our policies at levels which are competitive and profitable 
our approach to underwriting is therefore consistent with our strategy of not sacrificing profitability and stability for top line revenue growth 
on october   we acquired of the outstanding common stock of amcomp incorporated amcomp for million the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  we are currently conducting business in states from coast to coast  with a concentration in california 
we are also licensed to write business in six additional states and the district of columbia 
we believe the acquisition supports our strategic goals and achieving our vision of being the leader in the property and casualty insurance industry specializing in workers compensation 
our results of operations for include the acquired operations of amcomp for the period november  through december  as of december   we wrote of our in force premiums in california 
we market and sell our workers compensation insurance products through independent local and regional agents and brokers  and through our strategic distribution partners and alliances  including our principal strategic partners  adp  inc adp and wellpoint  inc 
wellpoint 
as of december   we wrote million  or  of our in force premiums through adp and wellpoint 
we commenced operations as a private domestic mutual insurance company on january  when our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the assets  liabilities and operations of the nevada state industrial insurance system the fund 
the fund had over years of workers compensation experience in nevada 
in july  we acquired the renewal rights to a book of workers compensation insurance business  and certain other tangible and intangible assets  from fremont compensation insurance group and its affiliates fremont  primarily comprised of accounts in california and  to a lesser extent  in idaho  montana  utah and colorado 
because of the fremont transaction  we were able to establish our important relationships and distribution agreements with adp and wellpoint 
in february  we completed an initial public offering and conversion from a mutual insurance holding company owned by our policyholder members to a nevada stock corporation owned by our public stockholders 
in connection with our january  assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement with third party reinsurers  which substantially reduced exposure to losses for pre july  nevada insured risks 
pursuant to the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae  which represented substantially all of the fund s outstanding losses as of june  for claims with original dates of injury prior to july  entry into the lpt agreement resulted in a deferred reinsurance gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and this deferred gain is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
in addition  we receive a contingent commission under the lpt agreement 
increases and decreases in the contingent commission are reflected in our commission expense  see results of operations 
the workers compensation insurance market is highly competitive 
our strategy across market cycles is to maintain underwriting profitability  manage our expenses and focus on underserved markets within our targeted classes of businesses that we believe will provide greater opportunities for profitable returns 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the following net premiums earned 
previously  we have used two accepted methodologies for recording written premiums 
three of our insurance subsidiaries  epic  eac and eicn  have historically recorded written premiums using an annual method  where of the estimated annual premium is recorded at the inception of the policy 
ecic has historically recorded written premiums using a billed method  where premiums were recorded at the time policy installments were billed 
during the three months ended september   we conformed the method of recording written premiums for ecic to an annual method in order to be consistent across the company 
conforming the method had no impact on the consolidated statements of income  statements of stockholders equity or net cash flows 
the result of conforming the method impacted only premiums receivable and related unearned premium assets and liabilities 
the change to written premiums has been applied to all periods presented and did not have a material effect on any periods presented 
overall  net premiums earned increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily attributable to the acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by decreases related to the impact of price competition  the economic conditions and our commitment to underwriting discipline 
the economic contraction has disproportionately impacted net earned premiums in both nevada and florida 
both states experienced double digit unemployment and a decline in tourism 
classes of small businesses that were particularly affected include contractors and restaurants 
declining payrolls due to unemployment and reduced work hours  closures of small businesses and our continued underwriting discipline all contributed to lower premiums in these states 
overall  we expect to see continued downward pressure on premiums in  which will be partially offset by policy count growth  including growth attributable to our a excellent am best rating being extended to epic and eac and rate increases in california 
it is uncertain how these trends will impact profitability 
we believe that we are well positioned for an economic recovery due to our focus on small businesses  which have historically led economic recoveries 
california california  our largest market  represented of our in force premiums as of december  in california  we reduced our premium rates by from january  through december  this compared with the recommendation of the california commissioner of insurance california commissioner of a rate decline since january  in november  the california commissioner recommended that there be no overall change in the claims cost benchmark for policies written on or after january  in october  the workers compensation insurance rating bureau wcirb recommended a increase in the claims cost benchmark 
the california commissioner of insurance california commissioner responded with the approval of a average increase in the claims cost benchmark on new and renewal policies incepting on or after january  based upon our actuarial analysis of current and anticipated loss cost trends  we filed for an average rate increase in california for new and renewal policies incepting on or after february  in april  the wcirb submitted a revised recommendation to increase the claims cost benchmark effective july  the recommendation was based upon an increase in medical costs and an increase of directly attributable to additional costs arising from several workers compensation appeals board decisions 
in july  the california commissioner rejected the recommendation of the wcirb and left the claims cost benchmark unchanged 
we increased our rates by an average of for all new and renewal policies incepting on or after august  in august  the wcirb recommended a increase in the claims cost benchmark effective january  this recommendation was based upon the same factors that supported the april recommendation 
on november   the california commissioner again rejected the wcirb recommendation and left the claims cost benchmark unchanged 
based upon our actuarial analysis of current and anticipated loss cost trends  we filed for a increase for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  the average rate we file does not necessarily indicate the rate we charge to individual policyholders because an insured s experience modification factor is subject to revision annually and our underwriters may increase or decrease rates based upon individual risk characteristics 
florida florida is an administered pricing state 
in administered pricing states  insurance rates are set by the state commissioner of insurance who sets the rates that we are allowed to charge in those states 
in  florida enacted workers compensation reforms 
the reforms have resulted in significant declines in claim frequency  an improvement in loss development and a reduction in the cost of claims 
as a result  the florida commissioner of insurance florida commissioner approved and rate decreases for new and renewal policies incepting on or after january  and  respectively 
in february  the florida commissioner approved a increase in workers compensation rates for new and renewal policies incepting on or after april  this rate increase was in response to an october florida supreme court decision that materially impacted the statutory caps on attorney fees that were part of the reforms 
in june  the florida commissioner approved a decrease in workers compensation rates effective july   for new and renewal policies and the unexpired portions of outstanding policies with inception dates from april  through june  this rate decrease was due to the impact of florida house bill  which restored the statutory caps on attorney fees 
in august  the national council on compensation insurance ncci recommended a average rate decrease for new and renewal policies incepting on or after january  according to the ncci  this recommendation was in response to significant reductions in claims frequency  although the ncci noted that the pace of improvement has moderated 
the florida commissioner approved this rate decrease  making the cumulative rate decrease since the reforms of we cannot determine the full effect on our profitability at this time or if there will be continued downward pricing pressure in florida 
wisconsin wisconsin is an administered pricing state 
in july  the wisconsin commissioner of insurance wisconsin commissioner approved a overall rate increase on new and renewal policies incepting on or after october  on may   the wisconsin compensation rating bureau recommended an average rate increase of for new and renewal policies incepting on or after october  on july   the wisconsin commissioner approved the recommended increase 
nevada nevada continues to face downward pricing pressures and the effects of the economic contraction 
in  both policy count and average policy size declined approximately in nevada 
these factors  along with the acquisition  contributed to nevada falling from our second to fourth largest producing state 
in february  the nevada commissioner of insurance nevada commissioner announced the approval of a filing submitted by the ncci for an average loss cost decrease of for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  we filed for an average rate decrease for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  in december  the nevada commissioner announced the approval of a filing submitted by the ncci for an average loss cost decrease of for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  we adopted the proposed rate decrease for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  we cannot determine the full effect on our profitability at this time or if there will be continued downward pricing pressure in nevada 
illinois in  the illinois commissioner of insurance illinois commissioner approved and average rate increases on new and renewal policies incepting on or after january  and april   respectively 
eac  our primary insurance subsidiary doing business in illinois  increased average rates and on new and renewal policies incepting on or after january  and april   respectively 
in september  the ncci recommended no change to the overall premium level  but a decrease to the industrial classes of business effective january   for new and renewal policies 
on november   the illinois commissioner approved the recommended rates 
eac decreased rates by for new and renewal policies incepting on or after january  net investment income and realized gains losses on investments 
we invest our statutory surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities including unearned premiums and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae in fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
in addition  a portion of these funds is held in cash and cash equivalents to pay current claims 
net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities less bank service charges  custodial and portfolio management fees 
realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
realized gains losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original cost equity securities or amortized cost fixed maturity securities 
net unrealized gains or losses on our securities are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
we monitor our portfolio to preserve principal values whenever possible 
all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
when  in the opinion of management  an impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the security is written down to its fair value and the amount written down is recorded in earnings as a realized loss on investments in the period in which other than temporary determination is made 
our investment guidelines have been modified to meet our consolidated business strategy 
the revised guidelines incorporate lower fixed income duration parameters  a reduction in target equity balances  a lower target weight for the tax exempt municipal fixed income sector and revised benchmark compositions 
our overall investment philosophy is to maximize total investment returns within the constraints of prudent portfolio risk management 
we employ conning asset manager conning to act as our independent investment manager 
conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our board of directors 
the fixed maturity securities portion of our portfolio maintains a duration target of and a maximum tax exempt capacity of not more than of the total fixed maturity portfolio 
the equity portion of our portfolio has an authorized allocation range of 
decreasing the equity allocation has the effect of decreasing surplus volatility because under statutory accounting principles  equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains losses charged directly to surplus in contrast to fixed income securities which are carried at amortized cost with no impact on surplus due to changes in fair value 
at year end  our equity position was  which is above our selected target of 
the decreasing equity allocation has helped to increase the tax equivalent investment yield from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  our tax exempt allocation is supported by our strong operating profitability and tax paying status 
as this process is dynamic in nature and reviewed at a detailed level on a quarterly basis  there could be further changes in the duration and allocation of the portfolio 
expenses our expenses consist of the following losses and lae 
losses and lae represent our largest expense item and include claim payments made  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
the quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and lae  which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques 
in some of our states we have a short operating history and must rely on a combination of industry experience and our specific experience to establish our best estimate of losses and lae reserves 
the interpretation of historical data can be impacted by external forces  principally regulatory changes  economic fluctuations and legal trends 
in recent years  we experienced lower losses and lae in california than we anticipated due to factors such as regulatory reform designed to reduce loss costs in that market and lower than expected inflation 
however  there is uncertainty about whether recent paid loss trends in california will continue 
the wcirb s most recent evaluation of loss experience recognized increasing medical costs 
we believe the joint marketing of our workers compensation insurance with wellpoint s health insurance products also assists in reducing losses since employees make fewer workers compensation claims because they are insured for non work related illnesses or injuries and thus are less likely to seek treatment for a non work related illness or injury through their employers workers compensation insurance carrier 
we have established reserves for losses based on our current best estimate of loss costs  taking into consideration medical cost and incurred loss trends 
as we continue to gain experience in our newer markets  we rely more on our own loss experience and place less reliance on industry experience 
commission expense 
commission expense includes direct commissions to our agents and brokers for the premiums that they produce for us 
also included in commission expense are incentive payments  other direct marketing costs and fees 
commission expense is net of contingent commission income related to the lpt agreement 
commissions paid to our agents and brokers are deferred and amortized to commission expense in our consolidated statements of income as the premiums generating these commissions are earned 
we pay commissions that we believe are competitive with other workers compensation insurers 
we are entitled to receive a contingent profit commission under the lpt agreement 
the contingent profit is an amount based on the favorable difference between actual paid losses and loss expenses and expected paid losses and loss expenses under the lpt agreement 
loss expenses are deemed to be of total losses paid and are paid to us as compensation for management of the lpt claims 
the reinsurers pay us of any favorable difference in actual amounts paid compared to contractually expected amounts to be paid under the agreement 
the calculation of the contingent profit commission  which is based on actual amounts paid versus expected amounts are determined every five years beginning june  for the first twenty five years of the agreement 
conversely  we could be required to return any previously paid contingent profit commission  with interest in the event of unfavorable differences 
we estimate ultimate contingent profit commission through june  and record it as commission expense 
increases or decreases in the estimated contingent profit commission are reflected in commission expense in the period that the estimate is revised 
for the year ended december   we decreased commission expenses by million as a result of an increase in contingent profit commissions and received million from the reinsurers 
estimated total losses and loss adjustment expenses covered by the lpt agreement and to be paid through june  were reduced by approximately million from the previous estimate 
pursuant to the lpt agreement  actual amounts paid for losses under the lpt agreement for the period july  through june   were million as compared to contractually expected losses and loss expenses of approximately million 
dividends to policyholders 
in administered pricing states such as florida and wisconsin  insurance rates are set by state insurance regulators 
rate competition generally is not permitted in these states and  consequently  policyholder dividend programs are an important competitive factor 
in florida and wisconsin  and to a much more limited extent in several of our other states  we offer dividend programs to eligible policyholders under which a portion of the premium paid by a policyholder may be returned in the form of a dividend 
eligibility for these programs varies based upon the nature of the policyholder s operations  expected premium paid  loss experience and existing controls intended to minimize workers compensation claims and costs 
an estimated provision for policyholders dividends is accrued as the related premiums are earned 
such dividends do not become a fixed liability until declared by the respective boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
additionally  florida statutes require the return of policyholders premium pursuant to a formula based on underwriting results 
our ultimate obligation is dependent on our filings with the florida office of insurance regulation and on our prescribed loss reserves included in our annual statutory financial statements 
we account for these payments as dividends to policyholders 
underwriting and other operating expenses 
underwriting and other operating expenses includes the costs to acquire and maintain an insurance policy excluding commissions consisting of premium taxes and certain other general expenses that vary with  and are primarily related to  producing new or renewal business 
these acquisition costs are deferred and amortized to underwriting and other operating expense in the consolidated statements of income as the related premiums are earned 
other underwriting expenses consist of policyholder dividends  changes in estimates of future write offs of premiums receivable  general administrative expenses such as salaries and benefits  rent  office supplies  depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately  fees and assessments of boards  bureaus and assessments of statistical agencies for policy service and administration items such as rating manuals  rating plans and experience data 
our underwriting and other operating expenses are a reflection of our operating efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering our business 
policy acquisition costs are variable based on premiums earned 
however  underwriting and other costs are more fixed in nature and become a larger percentage of net premiums earned as premiums trend lower 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we incurred one time pre tax integration and restructuring charges  not including capitalized costs  of approximately million  including million of severance benefits for the year ended december  additionally  we achieved pre tax cost savings of approximately million in  and expect to achieve pre tax cost savings annually of million to million beginning in interest expense 
we incur interest expenses on acquired surplus notes and the second amended and restated secured credit facility amended credit facility 
interest expense is paid quarterly in arrears on the surplus notes 
the expense for each interest payment on the surplus notes is based on the three month libor rate plus to basis points 
interest expense is paid quarterly in arrears on the amended credit facility 
the interest expense is based on the day libor rate plus basis points 
additionally  we have an interest rate swap agreement on the amended credit facility 
interest paid on the amended credit facility and the interest rate swap was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies management believes it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers some of these policies to be very important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results in future periods might differ from these estimates 
management believes that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for losses and lae  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from reinsurers  recognition of premium revenue  deferred income taxes  the valuation of investments and goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we are directly liable for losses and lae under the terms of insurance policies our insurance subsidiaries underwrite 
significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss 
our loss reserves are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets under the line item caption unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
as of december   our reserves for unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  were billion 
accounting for workers compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and lae  referred to as loss reserves  as of a balance sheet date 
our estimate of loss reserves is intended to equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and lae of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid 
management establishes the loss reserve based on its own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions 
our aggregate carried reserve for unpaid losses and lae is a point estimate  which is the sum of our reserves for each accident year in which we have exposure 
this aggregate carried reserve calculated by us represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and lae 
maintaining the adequacy of the loss reserve estimate is an inherent risk of the workers compensation insurance business 
as described below  workers compensation claims may be paid over a long period of time 
therefore  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may involve more uncertainty than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the claim amount 
the amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate  measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates  differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development 
reserve development is unfavorable when payments for losses are made for more than the levels at which they were reserved or when subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims 
in this case  the previously estimated loss reserves are considered deficient 
reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves 
in this case  the previously estimated loss reserves are considered redundant 
reserve development  whether due to an increase or decrease in the aggregate estimated losses  is reflected in operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and lae during the accounting period in which the development is recognized 
although claims for which reserves are established may not be paid for several years or more  we do not discount loss reserves in our financial statements for the time value of money 
the three main components of our reserves for unpaid losses and lae are case reserves  incurred but not reported or ibnr reserves  and lae reserves 
case reserves are estimates of future claim payments based upon periodic case by case evaluation and the judgment of our claims adjusting staff  as applied at the individual claim level 
our claims examiners determine these case reserves for reported claims on a claim by claim basis  based on the examiner s judgment and experience and on our case reserving practices 
we update and monitor our case reserves frequently to appropriately reflect current information 
our case reserving practices account for the type of business or occupation of the injured worker  the circumstances surrounding the claim  the nature of the accident and of the resulting injury  the current medical condition and physical capabilities of the injured worker  the expected future course and cost of medical treatment and of the injured worker s disability  the existence of dependents of the injured worker  policy provisions  the statutory benefit provisions applicable to the claim  relevant case law in the state  and potentially other factors and considerations 
ibnr is an actuarial estimate of future claim payments beyond those considered in the case reserve estimates  relating to claims arising from accidents that occurred during a particular time period on or prior to the balance sheet date 
thus  ibnr is the compilation of the estimated ultimate losses for each accident year less amounts that have been paid and case reserves 
ibnr reserves  unlike case reserves  do not apply to a specific claim  but rather apply to the entire body of claims arising from a specific time period 
ibnr primarily provides for costs due to future claim payments in excess of case reserves on recorded open claims  additional claim payments on closed claims  and the cost of claims that have not yet been reported to us 
most of our ibnr reserves relate to estimated future claim payments over and above our case reserves on recorded open claims 
for workers compensation  most claims are reported to the employer and to the insurance company relatively quickly  and relatively small amounts are paid on claims that already have been closed which we refer to as reopenings 
consequently  late reporting and reopening of claims are a less significant part of ibnr for our insurance subsidiaries 
lae reserves are our estimate of the diagnostic  legal  administrative and other similar expenses that we will pay in the future to manage claims that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date 
lae reserves are established in the aggregate  rather than on a claim by claim basis 
a portion of our losses and lae obligations are ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers 
we establish our losses and lae reserves both gross and net of ceded reinsurance 
the determination of the amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and lae reserves includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance policies  as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the lpt agreement 
our reinsurance arrangements also include an intercompany pooling arrangement between eicn  ecic  epic and eac whereby each of the insurance subsidiaries cedes some of its premiums  losses  and lae to the others  but this intercompany pooling arrangement does not affect our consolidated financial statements 
our reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses gross and net  as well as the above described main components of such reserves  were as follows december  in thousands case reserves ibnr lae gross unpaid losses and lae reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae  gross net unpaid losses and lae workers compensation is considered to be a long tail line of insurance  meaning that there can be an extended elapsed period between when a claim occurs when the worker is injured on the job and the final payment and resolution of the claim 
as discussed above  the long tail for workers compensation usually is not caused by a delay in the reporting of the claim 
the vast majority of our workers compensation claims are reported very promptly 
the long tail for workers compensation is caused by the fact that benefits are often paid over a long period of time  and many of the benefit amounts are difficult to determine in advance of their payment 
our obligations with respect to an injured worker may include medical care and disability related payments for the duration of the injured worker s disability  in accordance with state workers compensation statutes  all of which payments are considered as part of a single workers compensation claim and are our responsibility if we were providing coverage to the employer on the date of injury 
for example  in addition to medical expenses  an injured worker may receive payments for lost income associated with total or partial disability  whether temporary or permanent ie  the disability is expected to continue until normal retirement age or death  whichever comes first 
we may also be required to make payments  often over a period of many years  to surviving spouses and children of workers who are killed in the course and scope of their employment 
the specific components of injured workers benefits are defined by the laws in each state 
based on historical insurance industry experience countrywide  as reported by am best  approximately ten percent of workers compensation claim dollars are expected to be paid more than ten years after the claim occurred 
while our payout pattern likely will differ from that of the industry  industry experience illustrates the general duration of workers compensation claims 
the duration of the injured worker s disability  the course and cost of medical treatment  as well as the lifespan of dependents  are uncertain and are difficult to determine in advance 
we endeavor to minimize this risk by closing claims promptly  to the extent feasible 
in addition  there are no policy limits on our liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance 
we endeavor to mitigate this risk by purchasing reinsurance that will provide us with financial protection against the impact of very large claims and catastrophes 
although we update and monitor our case reserves frequently as appropriate to reflect current information  it is very difficult to set precise case reserves for an individual claim due to the inherent uncertainty about the future duration of a specific injured worker s disability  the course and cost of medical care for that injured worker  and the other factors described above 
therefore  in addition to establishing case reserves on a claim by claim basis  we  like other workers compensation insurance companies  establish ibnr reserves based on analyses and projections of aggregate claims data 
evaluating data on an aggregate basis eliminates some of the uncertainty associated with an individual claim 
however  considerable uncertainty remains as many claims can be affected simultaneously by changes in environmental conditions such as medical technology  medical costs and medical cost inflation  economic conditions  the legal and regulatory climate  and other factors 
the cost of a group of workers compensation claims is not known with certainty until every one of the claims is ultimately closed 
unpaid lae is also estimated and monitored 
the amount that will be spent managing claims will depend on the duration of the claims  the course of the injured worker s disability and medical treatment  the nature and degree of any disputes relating to our obligations to the claimant  the administrative and legal environment in which issues are addressed and resolved  and the cost of the company personnel and other resources that are used in the management of claims 
therefore  our lae reserves also contribute to the overall uncertainty of our aggregate reserve for unpaid losses and lae 
for the reasons described above  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the ultimate loss and with policy limits on the insurer s liability for claim amounts 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be deficient or redundant relative to our actual losses and lae 
actuarial methodologies are used by workers compensation insurance companies  including us  to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of unpaid losses and lae 
as mentioned above  management considers the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions  among other factors  in establishing the reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
judgment is required in the actuarial estimation of unpaid losses and lae 
the judgments include the selection of methodologies to project the ultimate cost of claims  the selection of projection parameters based on historical company data  industry data  and other benchmarks  the identification and quantification of potential changes in parameters from historical levels to current and future levels due to changes in future claims development expectations caused by internal or external factors  and  the weighting of differing reserve indications that result from alternative methods and assumptions 
the adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves  which are based on estimates  is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business  which we attempt to mitigate through our claims management process and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims 
however  no assurance can be given as to whether the ultimate liability will be more or less than our loss reserve estimates 
we retain an independent actuarial consulting firm consulting actuary to perform comprehensive studies of our losses and lae liability on a semi annual basis 
the role of our consulting actuary is to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates  as well as a point estimate  of our unpaid losses and lae liability  and to present those results to our actuarial staff and to management 
for purposes of analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time  we compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year or quarter in which the claim occurred accident year or accident quarter  since each such group of claims is at a different stage of progression toward the ultimate resolution and payment of those claims 
the claims data is aggregated and compiled separately for different types of claims and or claimant benefits and or for different states or groups of states in which we do business 
both the consulting actuary and the internal actuarial staff select and apply a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods to our data 
the methods vary in their responsiveness to different information  characteristics and dynamics in the data  and thus the results of the various methods assist the actuary in considering these characteristics and dynamics in the historical data 
the methods employed for each segment of claims data  and the relative weight accorded to each method  vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims the primary methods utilized in recent evaluations are paid bornhuetter ferguson method 
a method assigning partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
a method assigning partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars paid losses plus case reserves 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
paid development method 
a method that uses actual historical  cumulative paid losses by accident year to develop estimated ultimate losses 
the overall development is based on the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate  for the expected effects of known changes in the workers compensation environment  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
reported development method 
a method that uses actual historical  cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year to develop estimated ultimate losses 
the overall development is based on the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate  for the expected effects of known changes in the workers compensation environment  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
initial expected loss method 
this method is used as an input to the bornhuetter ferguson methods 
initial expected losses for an accident year are based on one or more of industry benchmark losses per dollar of payroll for the mix of employment classes insured  prior evaluation dates projections of ultimate losses for the accident year  by applying to premiums a set of initial expected loss ratios selected after analyzing the development projections for each accident year  loss trends  statutory benefit changes  rate change  and historical company loss ratios  and by applying to claim counts a set of expected claim severities selected after analyzing the claim severities implied by development method projections for other periods  loss trends  and statutory benefit changes 
each of the methods listed above requires the selection and application of parameters and assumptions 
the key parameters and assumptions are the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  claims cost inflation rates  the effects of legislative benefit changes and or judicial changes  and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
of these  we believe the most important are the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time and claims cost inflation rates 
each of these key items is discussed in the following paragraphs 
all of the methods depend in part on the selection of an expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time 
we compile  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  organized in a manner which provides an indication of the historical patterns with which claims have emerged and have been paid 
to the extent that the historical data may not provide sufficient information about future patterns  whether due to environmental changes such as legislation or due to the small volume or short history of data for some segments of our business  benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts made by industry rate bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns  may be used to supplement  adjust  or replace patterns based on our subsidiaries historical data 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed  and our views regarding current and future claim patterns are among the factors that enter into our establishment of the losses and lae reserves at each balance sheet date 
when short term averages or external rate bureau analyses indicate that the claims patterns are changing from historical company or industry patterns  that new or forecasted information typically is factored into the methodologies gradually  so that the projections will not overreact to what may turn out to be a temporary or unwarranted assumption about changes in patterns 
when new claims emergence or payment patterns have appeared in the actual data repeatedly over multiple evaluations  or when the changes in patterns are explained by external events such as legislative benefit changes and or judicial changes  those new patterns are given greater weight in the selection process 
because some claims are paid over many years  the selection of claim emergence and payment patterns involves judgmentally estimating the manner in which recently occurring claims will develop many years or decades in the future  and it is likely that the actual development that will occur in the distant future could differ substantially from historical patterns or current projections 
the current projections would differ if different claims development patterns were selected by the actuaries 
the actual payout pattern for the aggregate claims associated with an accident year will not be known until decades later  when all the claims are closed 
the expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time is expressed as a percentage of ultimate losses that remain to be paid at each evaluation date for each accident year or accident quarter 
a lower estimate of the percentage of aggregate claims dollars remaining to be paid  when applied in the actuarial methods  produces a lower dollar estimate of the unpaid loss 
several of the methods also involve adjusting historical data for inflation 
for these methods  the inflation rates used in the analysis are judgmentally selected based on historical year to year movements in the cost of claims observed in the data of our insurance subsidiaries and in industry wide data  as well as on broader inflation indices 
the results of these methods would differ if different inflation rates were selected 
in projections using december  data  the methods that use explicit medical cost inflation assumptions included medical cost inflation assumptions ranging from to 
the selection of medical cost inflation assumptions for use in the actuarial methodologies has been based on observed recent and longer term historical medical cost inflation in our claims data and in the us economy more generally 
the rate of medical cost inflation as reflected in our historical medical payments per claim has averaged approximately over the past five to ten years 
the rate of medical cost inflation in the general us economy  as measured by the consumer price index medical care  has averaged approximately over the past ten years 
for eicn  the analysis of unpaid loss is conducted on claims data prior to recognition of reinsurance 
a separate projection is made of future reinsurance recoveries based on our reinsurance arrangements and an analysis of large claims experience  both for eicn and as reflected in industry based benchmarks 
the projections prior to recognition of reinsurance provide the basis for estimating gross of reinsurance unpaid losses  from which the projection of future reinsurance recoveries is subtracted to estimate net of reinsurance unpaid losses 
for ecic  the analysis of unpaid loss is conducted on claims data net of reinsurance  and a separate projection is made of future reinsurance recoveries  which is added to the estimated net of reinsurance unpaid losses to estimate gross of reinsurance unpaid losses 
for epic and eac  the analysis of unpaid losses is conducted for various retention levels corresponding to the reinsurance program structure  as well as on an unlimited retention basis as if there were no reinsurance 
by applying factors that quantify the proportion of losses in each layer that are ceded to reinsurers  the analysis produces estimated net of reinsurance unpaid losses  as well as estimated gross of reinsurance unpaid losses 
management along with internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary separately analyze lae and estimate unpaid lae 
this analysis relies primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amount that has been spent on lae historically  as compared with the volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical calendar periods 
based on these historical relationships  estimates of the extent to which claim management resources are focused on the initial handling of claims and on the ongoing management of claims  and projections of the volume of claims activity in future calendar periods related to current and prior accident year claims  the consulting actuary selects a range of future lae estimates that is a function of the projected future claim activity 
the portion of unpaid lae that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms 
based on the results of the analyses conducted  the stability of the historical data  and the characteristics of the various claims segments analyzed  the consulting actuary selects a range of estimated unpaid losses and lae and a point estimate of unpaid losses and lae  for presentation to internal actuarial staff and management 
the selected range is intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall 
this range is narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely  although it is possible  that the high or low result will emerge for every claim segment and accident year 
the consulting actuary s point estimate of unpaid losses and lae is based on a judgmental selection for each claim segment from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods 
management formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis 
in doing so  we make reference to the most current analyses of our consulting actuary  including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used by the consulting actuary 
comprehensive studies are conducted as of june and december by both internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary 
on the alternate quarters  the preceding study results are updated for actual claim payment activity during the quarter 
management determines the ibnr and lae components of our loss reserves by establishing a point in the range of the consulting actuary s most recent analysis of unpaid losses and lae 
the selection of the point is based on management s own view of recent and future claim emergence patterns  payment patterns  and trend information obtained from internal actuarial staff pertaining to the markets in which we are operating  including economic  business  and political conditions  the characteristics of the business we have written in recent quarters  recent and pending recoveries from reinsurance  the number and costs of claims  and the costs of managing claims  and other similar considerations as we view relevant 
the aggregate carried reserve calculated by management represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and lae 
we believe that we should be conservative in our reserving practices due to the long tail nature of workers compensation claims payouts  the susceptibility of those future payments to unpredictable external forces such as medical cost inflation and other economic conditions  and the actual variability of loss reserve adequacy that we have observed in the workers compensation insurance industry 
at december   management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was billion  which was million above the actuarial point estimate 
in establishing its best estimate at december   management and internal actuarial staff reviewed and considered a the consulting actuary assumptions  point estimate and range  b the inherent uncertainty of workers compensation unpaid losses and lae liabilities  and c the particular uncertainties associated with i the potential effects on the cost and payout pattern of claims following workers compensation system reforms enacted by the california and florida legislatures in late and the regulatory implementation of those reforms  the effects of which will become clear over a number of years  ii the uncertain cost of administering claims lae in the reformed california and florida systems  iii the potential for legislative and or judicial reversal of california and florida reforms  iv the rapid growth in the volume of our business in california  and v the degree of movement observed in eicn s prior years projections of losses and lae in nevada following premium and market share reductions 
management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each of these sources of uncertainty  but rather established an overall provision for unpaid losses and lae that  in management s opinion  represented a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  in light of the historical data  the actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  current facts and circumstances  and the sources of uncertainty identified by management 
management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  fell within the actuarial range of estimates 
the decrease in management s best estimate relative to the actuarial point estimate from december  to december  decreased losses and lae expense incurred by million for the year ended december  at december   management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was billion  which was million above the actuarial point estimate 
in establishing its best estimate at december   management and internal actuarial staff reviewed and considered a the consulting actuaries assumptions  point estimate and range  b the inherent uncertainty of workers compensation unpaid losses and lae liabilities  and c the particular uncertainties associated with i the potential effects on the cost and payout pattern of claims following workers compensation system reforms enacted by the california and florida legislatures in late and the regulatory implementation of those reforms  the effects of which will become clear over a number of years  ii the uncertain cost of administering claims lae in the reformed california and florida systems  iii the potential for legislative and or judicial reversal of california and florida reforms  iv the rapid growth in the volume of our business in california  and v the degree of movement observed in eicn s prior years projections of losses and lae in nevada following premium and market share reductions 
management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each of these sources of uncertainty  but rather established an overall provision for unpaid losses and lae that  in management s opinion  represented a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  in light of the historical data  the actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  current facts and circumstances  and the sources of uncertainty identified by management

management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each of these sources of uncertainty  but rather established an overall provision for unpaid losses and lae that  in management s opinion  represented a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  in light of the historical data  the actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  current facts and circumstances  and the sources of uncertainty identified by management 
management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  fell within the actuarial range of estimates 
the increase in management s best estimate relative to the actuarial point estimate from december  to december  increased losses and lae expense incurred by million for the year ended december  the table below provides the actuarial range of estimated liabilities for net unpaid losses and lae and our carried reserves at the dates shown as of december  in thousands low end of actuarial range carried reserves high end of actuarial range loss reserves are our estimates at a given point in time of our ultimate liability for the cost of claims and the cost of managing those claims  and are inherently uncertain 
it is likely that the ultimate liability will differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future claim emergence and payment patterns and estimates of future trends in claim frequency and claim cost 
these estimates assume that the claim emergence and payment patterns  claim inflation and claim frequency trend assumptions implicitly built into our selected loss reserve will continue into the future 
unexpected changes in claim cost inflation can occur through changes in general inflationary trends  changes in medical technology and procedures  changes in wage levels and general economic conditions and changes in legal theories of compensability of injured workers and their dependents 
furthermore  future costs can be influenced by changes in workers compensation statutory benefit structure  and benefit administration and delivery 
in applying actuarial techniques  judgment is required to determine the relevance of historical claim emergence and payment patterns and other historical data  external industry benchmark data  information about current economic conditions such as inflation  and recent changes in environmental conditions such as legislation as well as company operational changes in selecting parameters for those techniques under current facts and circumstances 
judgment also is required in selecting from among the loss indications produced by the several actuarial techniques that are used 
from evaluation to evaluation  it often is appropriate to adjust the various methods and parameters used in the projection of losses to reflect the expected or estimated effect of such factors 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
estimates of ultimate losses and lae may change from one balance sheet date to the next when actual claim payment or individual case reserve estimates between those dates differ from the expected claim activity underlying the prior loss reserve estimate  and when actual lae expenditures differ from expected expenditure levels underlying the prior lae reserve estimate 
as actual losses and lae expenditures occur during a calendar period  they replace the portion of prior estimates of unpaid losses and lae that relate to that period 
in addition  the parameters used in the various methods and the relative weight accorded to the results of the different actuarial methods  all of which require judgment  may change as a result of observing that the actual pattern of expenditures differs from prior expectations  as well as based on new industry wide data and benchmarks derived from that data  when available 
the parameters and weights used in estimating ultimate losses may also change when external conditions such as the statutory benefit structures or the manner in which it is being interpreted and administered  or inflation differ from expectations underlying the prior estimate of ultimate losses  and when the effects of factors related to internal operations differ from expectations underlying the prior estimate of ultimate losses 
each of the actuarial methods used in the analysis and estimation of unpaid losses and lae depend in part on the selection of an expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  and the assumption that this expected pattern will prevail into the future 
we select relevant patterns as part of the periodic review and projection of unpaid losses and lae 
in selecting these patterns  we examine  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  benchmarks based on industry data and forecasts made by industry rate bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed 
management judgment is required in selecting the amount of the loss reserve to record on our consolidated financial statements 
management reviews the various actuarial projections  the assumptions underlying those projections  the range of indications produced by the actuarial methods and the actual long term and recent emergence and payment of claims 
management also considers the environmental conditions in which the insurance subsidiaries are doing business 
in addition  management considers the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimates based on the degree of change that has occurred or is occurring in the environment and in operations 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves on a gaap basis december  in thousands unpaid losses and lae  gross of reinsurance  at beginning of period less reinsurance recoverable  excluding bad debt allowance  on unpaid losses and lae net unpaid losses and lae at beginning of period losses and lae  net of reinsurance  acquired in business combination losses and lae  net of reinsurance  incurred in current year prior years total net losses and lae incurred during the period deduct payments for losses and lae  net of reinsurance  related to current year prior years total net payments for losses and lae during the period ending unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance reinsurance recoverable  excluding bad debt allowance  on unpaid losses and lae unpaid losses and lae  gross of reinsurance  at end of period estimates of incurred losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years decreased due to continued favorable development in such prior accident years actual losses and lae paid and current projections of unpaid losses and lae were less than we originally anticipated 
the reduction in the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae related to prior years was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the major sources of favorable development include a actual paid losses have been less than expected and b the impact of new information on selected patterns of claims emergence and claim payment used in the projection of future loss payments 
new information includes our own information regarding the patterns of claim emergence  development and payment that have been observed in the most recent periods  and external information regarding the workers compensation environments in the states in which we operate 
prior to the acquisition of amcomp in  california and nevada comprised more than of the in force premium volume of eicn and ecic  and in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these two states still represent approximately of our reserves for unpaid loss and lae 
in california  where our operations began on july   the actuaries and management s initial expectations of the ultimate level of losses and patterns of loss emergence and loss payment necessarily were based on benchmarks derived from analyses of historical insurance industry data in california 
prior to july   no historical data from our california insurance subsidiary existed and  although some historical data was available for the prior years for some of the market segments we entered in california  that data was limited as to the number of loss reserve evaluation points available 
the industry based benchmarks were adjusted judgmentally for the anticipated impact of significant environmental changes  specifically the enactment of major changes to the statutory workers compensation benefit structure and the manner in which claims are administered and adjudicated in california 
the actual emergence and payment of claims by our california insurance subsidiary has been more favorable than those initial expectations  due at least in part  we believe  to the impact of enactment of the major changes in the california environment 
other insurance companies writing california workers compensation insurance have also experienced emergence and payment of claims more favorable than anticipated following the enactment of legislative changes 
at each evaluation date  the projected claim activity underlying the prior loss reserves has been replaced by the actual claim activity  and the expectation of future emergence and payment of california claims underlying the actuarial projections has been reevaluated periodically based both on our insurance subsidiaries emerging experience and on updating the benchmarks that are derived from observing and analyzing the insurance industry data for california workers compensation 
in nevada  we have compiled a lengthy history of workers compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the fund and eicn  but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long term history in nevada with the fund 
the expected patterns of claim payments and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claim payments are based on both long term and short term historical data 
in recent evaluations  claim patterns have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with short term historical data 
consequently  our selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on patterns observed in recent years 
also  at each evaluation date  the projected claim payments underlying the prior loss reserves were replaced by the actual claim payment activity that occurred during the calendar year 
we experience favorable and unfavorable loss reserve development in other states as well  and we monitor all of the markets in which we do business 
the reserve development in other states is a small component of the overall favorable loss reserve development that we have experienced during   and the estimate of the future cost of handling claims  or lae  depends primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amount that has been spent on lae historically  as compared with the dollar volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical periods 
we have experienced favorable development on our lae reserves in   and  primarily due to reductions in the projected cost of losses in california that have reduced the projected cost of future lae in the aggregate notwithstanding that we have increased the amount that we are spending and expect to spend on claims administration per dollar of losses in the workers compensation environment in california 
we review our loss reserves each quarter and  as previously discussed  our consulting actuary assists our review by performing a comprehensive actuarial analysis and projection of unpaid losses and lae twice each year 
we may adjust our reserves based on the results of our reviews and these adjustments could be significant 
if we change our estimates  these changes are reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made 
our overall actual claims and lae experience and emergence in recent years have been more favorable than anticipated in prior evaluations 
our insurance subsidiaries have been operating in a period of drastically changing environmental conditions in our major markets  entry into new markets  and operational changes 
during periods characterized by such changes  at each evaluation  the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long term historical and recent company data  external data  evaluations of environmental and operational changes and other factors in selecting the methods to use in projecting ultimate losses and lae  the parameters to incorporate in those methods  and the relative weights to accord to the different projection indications 
since the loss reserves are providing for claim payments that will emerge over many years  if management s projections and loss reserves were established in a manner that reacted quickly to each new emerging trend in the data or in the environment  there would be a high likelihood that future adjustments  perhaps significant in magnitude  would be required to correct for trends that turned out not to be persistent 
at each balance sheet evaluation  some losses and lae projection methods have produced indications above the loss reserve selected by management and some losses and lae projection methods have produced indications lower than the loss reserve selected by management 
at each evaluation  management has given weight to new data  recent indications  and evaluations of environmental conditions and changes that implicitly reflect management s expectation as to the degree to which the future will resemble the most recent information and most recent changes  as compared with long term claim payment  claim emergence  and claim cost inflation patterns 
it is likely that ultimate losses and lae will differ from the loss reserves recorded in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
actual losses and lae payments could be greater or less than our projections  perhaps significantly 
the following paragraphs discuss several potential sources of such deviations  and illustrate their potential magnitudes 
in recent years  emerging claims costs and claim emergence and payment patterns have improved dramatically 
the largest driver of this improvement has been california reform 
as we observe continuing improvement in development  we have given significant weight to this emerging trend in projecting and selecting estimated ultimate losses and lae 
the amount of weight to allocate between the emerging trend and historical benchmark patterns is judgmental 
recent data points from our business in california  as well as from insurance industry experience for california workers compensation  indicate emergence patterns even more favorable than those implicitly underlying our loss reserves 
if future emergence matches those more favorable patterns  our current loss reserves could develop favorably over time 
if future claims emergence more closely resembles long term historical industry patterns  then our current loss reserves could develop unfavorably over time 
in nevada  we have seen a significant improvement in claims emergence and claims payment patterns in recent years  and have given these improved patterns significant weight in establishing loss reserves for our nevada business 
if future emergence in nevada more closely resembles long term historical patterns of the predecessor fund  our current loss reserves could develop unfavorably over time 
workers compensation benefits are paid in accordance with statutory provisions in each state  which in some cases vary significantly from state to state 
from time to time  typically in connection with disputed claims  state administrative and judicial authorities promulgate decisions that have broad precedential effects on the entire industry s handling  payment and settlement of a significant segment of currently open as well as future claims 
one or several such precedential rulings in the states where we do business could cause us to reevaluate our expectations regarding the future handling and costs of significant numbers of claims  and produce unfavorable or potentially favorable development in our loss reserves 
economic conditions affect workers compensation claims in many ways 
for example  an economic downturn may affect the mix of the occupations  demographics  and experience of employed workers and therefore affect the number  type and severity of injuries 
during recessionary periods  employers may have fewer return to work opportunities for injured workers 
thus  our current inventory of open claims may develop differently than the experience underlying our historical data that we refer to as we perform our reserve analyses 
some of the actuarial projection methods also rely on a selection of claim cost inflation rates 
if actual claim cost inflation differs from expectations underlying prior selections  or as environmental conditions in the states in which we do business or in the economy generally change  we will reevaluate and may change the selected claim cost inflation rate in future analyses 
such a change in assumptions would cause the results of some of the actuarial methods to change from one evaluation to the next 
the ultimate cost of our claims will depend in part on actual inflation rates in future years  which may differ from the inflation expectations implicit in our loss reserves 
more than of our claims payments during the three years ended december  related to medical care for injured workers 
the utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers compensation 
we are not able to state the rate of medical cost inflation that is assumed in our loss reserves because our loss reserves are established based on reviewing the results of actuarial methods that do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates  as well as methods that do 
however  because medical care will be provided over many years  and in some cases decades  to the injured workers who have open claims  the pace of medical claim cost inflation has a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments 
for example  if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at december   we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of current claims would increase by approximately million on a net of reinsurance basis 
our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims and assume we will not be subject to losses from significant new legal liability theories 
while it is not possible to predict the impact of changes in this environment  if expanded legal theories of liability emerge  our ibnr claims may differ substantially from our ibnr reserves 
our reserve estimates assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory and legislative environment 
the impact of potential changes in the regulatory or legislative environment is difficult to quantify in the absence of specific  significant new regulation or legislation 
in the event of significant new regulation or legislation  we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business 
for lae  particularly in nevada  our projections assume a long term cost of managing claims that is greater than the recent levels of lae produced by our insurance subsidiaries current operating model  but is less than the levels of lae expended in past years by our insurance subsidiaries and by the fund 
in california  our projections assume that higher levels of lae per claim dollar that we have observed in the recent past will persist in the future 
in other states  our projections assume that historical levels of lae expenditure will continue into the future 
future changes in the claims environment and or changes in claims operations  while not currently planned or contemplated  could result in future actual lae and future projections of lae that may differ from current estimates 
the range of estimates of unpaid losses and lae produced by the actuarial reviews of the impact of medical cost inflation provide some indication of the potential variability of future losses and lae payments 
however  the full range of potential variation of actual ultimate losses and lae from our current reserve for unpaid losses and lae is difficult to estimate because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in many of the states in which we now operate 
if the actual unpaid losses and lae were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range  the impact on our financial results would be as follows december  in thousands increase decrease in reserves at low end of range at high end of range increase decrease in equity and net income  net of income tax effect at low end of range at high end of range however  the actuarial range represents an estimated range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses and lae will fall  based on the actuarial review of the results of the various methodologies and parameters used by the actuaries in the projection of losses and lae 
each different actuarial method may produce a different indication of unpaid losses and lae because each method relies in different ways on assumptions about the future 
for example  the loss development methods are based on an assumption that the selected pattern of emergence or payout of claims will recur in the future 
the initial expected loss method assumes that the ultimate losses can be estimated based on the payroll of workers insured by us and a benchmark loss cost per payroll  or estimated as a percentage of premiums  or estimated based on an estimated average cost per claim 
the bornhuetter ferguson methods rely on a combination of these assumptions 
actual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or methodology can represent  and each actuarial methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics 
none of the methods are designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods 
nonetheless  at any given evaluation date  some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside the consulting actuary s selected range  and the selection of reasonable alternative methods or reasonable alternative parameters in the actuarial projection process would produce an even wider range of potential outcomes  both above and below the range shown 
accordingly  we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes 
the magnitude of adjustments to prior years reserves for unpaid losses and lae reserves that we have made at december   and  decreases of million  million  and million respectively  also illustrate that changes in estimates of unpaid losses and lae can be significant from year to year 
we do not have a basis for anticipating that actual future payments of losses and lae are more likely to be either greater than or less than the reserve for unpaid losses and lae on our current balance sheet 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent a amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  b amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses  and c amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr for losses and lae 
these recoverables  by necessity  are based upon our current estimates of the underlying losses and lae  and are reported on our consolidated balance sheet separately as assets  as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders 
we bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some of the unpaid losses and lae remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them  or they might delay payment 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we continually monitor the financial condition and rating agency ratings of our reinsurers 
we require reinsurers that are not admitted reinsurers in california  florida or nevada to collateralize their share of the unearned premiums and unpaid loss reserves in order that our insurance subsidiaries receive credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial statements 
since our inception in  no material amounts due from reinsurers have been written off as uncollectible and  based on this experience  we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly require no material prospective adjustment 
under the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july   for consideration of million in cash 
as of december   the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were approximately million 
losses and lae paid with respect to the lpt agreement totaled approximately million at december  we account for the lpt agreement as retroactive reinsurance 
upon entry into the lpt agreement  a deferred reinsurance gain was recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
this gain is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
in addition  we are entitled to receive a contingent commission under the lpt agreement 
the contingent commission is estimated based on both actual results to date and projections of expected ultimate losses under the lpt agreement 
increases and decreases in the estimated contingent commission are reflected in our commission expense in the year that the estimate is revised 
recognition of premium revenue all premium revenue is recognized over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
at the end of the policy term  payroll based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year 
earned but unbilled premiums include estimated future audit premiums 
estimates of future audit premiums are based on our historical experience 
these estimates are subject to changes in policyholders payrolls  economic conditions and seasonality 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known 
any such adjustments are included in current operations 
since our inception in  there have been no material adjustments of our accrual for earned but unbilled premium and  based on this experience  and  although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly require no material prospective adjustment 
accounting for income taxes our accounting for income taxes recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a tax rate change impacts our net income or loss in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 
our income tax returns are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and various state tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
although we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters 
in assessing whether our deferred tax assets will be realized  management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
as a result  the adoption of fasb asc topic did not result in any change in the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit 
further  we elected to continue to record both interest and penalties related to any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
in  we reversed million of the liability including million in interest as certain statutory periods expired 
in  the remaining balance was reversed million  including million in interest and the liability was eliminated 
in  when the liability was initially recorded  the result was an increase in tax expense and our effective tax rate 
in and  as the liability was reversed  the impact was a decrease in tax expense and our effective tax rate 
valuation of investments our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of equity  net of deferred taxes as a component of net accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized in operations on the specific identification basis 
impairment of investment securities 
impairment of an investment security results in a reduction of the carrying value of the security and the realization of a loss when the fair value of the security declines below our cost or amortized cost  as applicable  for the security and the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
we regularly review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
we consider various factors in determining if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary 
some of the factors we consider include how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  the outlook for industry sectors and macro economic changes  our intent on not selling the securities and that it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the securities until their fair value recovers above cost  or to maturity  any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  and any reduction or elimination of dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled interest payments 
the amount of any write downs is determined by the difference between cost or amortized cost of the investment and its fair value at the time the other than temporary decline was identified 
goodwill and other intangible assets we prepare a valuation analysis for goodwill and intangible assets  whereby we identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results 
measurement of results we evaluate our operations by using the following key measures gross premiums written 
gross premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums written and assumed premiums written before the effect of ceded reinsurance 
direct premiums written represent the premiums on all policies our insurance subsidiaries have issued during the year 
assumed premiums written represent the premiums that our insurance subsidiaries have received from an authorized state mandated pool 
we use gross premiums written  which excludes the impact of premiums ceded to reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period 
net premiums written 
net premiums written is the sum of direct premiums written and assumed premiums written less ceded premiums written 
ceded premiums written is the portion of direct premiums written that we cede to our reinsurers under our reinsurance contracts 
we use net premiums written  primarily in relation to gross premiums written  to measure the amount of business retained after cession to reinsurers 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned represents that portion of net premiums written equal to the expired portion of the time for which insurance protection was provided during the financial year and is recognized as revenue 
net premiums earned are used to calculate the losses and lae  commission expense  dividends to policyholders  underwriting and other operating expenses and combined ratios  as indicated below 
losses and lae ratio 
the losses and lae ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of losses and lae to net premiums earned 
like many insurance companies  we analyze our losses and lae ratios on a calendar year basis and on an accident year basis 
a calendar year losses and lae ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and lae incurred during the calendar year  regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred  by the net premiums earned during that calendar year 
the calendar year losses and lae ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and lae established for insured events occurring in the current and prior periods 
a calendar year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
an accident year losses and lae ratio  or losses and lae for insured events that occurred during a particular year divided by the premiums earned for the year  is calculated by dividing the losses and lae  regardless of when such losses and lae are incurred  for insured events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year 
an accident year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
an accident year losses and lae ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably  respectively  whereas the calendar year losses and lae ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods 
this is an operating ratio based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our gaap financial information 
we analyze our calendar year losses and lae ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and lae from all periods  including development whether favorable or unfavorable of reserves established in prior periods 
in contrast  we analyze our accident year losses and lae ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and lae from insured events occurring during that year 
while calendar year losses and lae ratios are useful in measuring our profitability  we believe that accident year losses and lae ratios are more meaningful in evaluating our underwriting performance for any particular year because an accident year losses and lae ratio better matches premium and loss information 
furthermore  accident year losses and lae ratios are not distorted by adjustments to reserves established for insured events that occurred in other periods  which may be influenced by factors that are not generally applicable to all years 
the losses and lae ratios provided in this report are calendar year losses and lae ratios  except where they are expressly identified as accident year losses and lae ratios 
commission expense ratio 
the commission expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of commission expense to net premiums earned and measures the cost of compensating agents and brokers for the business we have underwritten 
dividends to policyholders ratio 
the dividends to policyholders ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of dividends to policyholders expense to net premiums earned and measures the cost of returning premium to policyholders in the form of dividends 
underwriting and other operating expenses ratio 
the underwriting and other operating expenses ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of underwriting and other operating expenses to net premiums earned  and measures an insurance company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio is a measure used in the property and casualty insurance business to show the profitability of an insurer s underwriting  and it represents the percentage of each premium dollar spent on claims and expenses 
the combined ratio is the sum of the losses and lae ratio  the commission expense ratio  dividends to policyholders ratio and underwriting and other operating expense ratio 
the losses and lae ratio  commission expense ratio and underwriting and other operating expense ratio express the relationship between losses and lae  commissions  dividends to policyholders and underwriting and other operating expenses  respectively  to net premiums earned 
when the combined ratio is below  an insurance company experiences underwriting gain  meaning that claims payments  the cost of settling claims  commissions  dividends to policyholders and underwriting expenses are less than premiums collected 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
companies with lower combined ratios than their peers generally experience greater profitability

as a result  the method of calculating written premiums has been conformed for this change to be comparable to written premiums 
the gross and net premiums written for all periods presented are calculated assuming the written premiums are of the estimated annual premium 
historically  written premiums for ecic were recorded using a billed method  where premiums were recorded at the time policy installments were billed 
the combined ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of losses and lae  commission expense  dividends to policyholders and underwriting and other operating expenses by net premiums earned 
because we only have one operating segment  holding company expenses are included in our calculation of the combined ratio 
we define net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement as net income less a amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement and b adjustments to lpt agreement ceded reserves 
deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap  but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory and gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes and net income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits  and  consequently  we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations

net income includes amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement  net income would have been million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues net premiums earned increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period of this increase was partially offset by lower gross premiums written  primarily california and nevada  which had million and million lower gross premiums written for the year ended compared to the same period of  respectively  as a result of rate reductions in certain markets  competition and impacts of economic conditions 
florida has also been affected by economic conditions  as indicated by lower estimated payrolls  upon which our premiums are based  combined with mandated rate reductions 
total policy count decreased  including policy count decreases of and in nevada and florida  respectively 
additionally  our average in force policy size decreased to  as of december   compared to  at december  net investment income increased for the year ended december  the increase in net investment income was related to a increase in average invested assets for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the average pre tax book yield on invested assets increased to at december   as compared to for the same period of the tax equivalent yield on invested assets increased to at december   as compared to at december  the increase in the tax equivalent yield was primarily due to the increase in the duration of our fixed maturity securities from at december   to at december  for the year ended december   realized gains on investments were million  compared to realized losses of million for the same period of the realized gains are attributable to the sale of previously impaired equity securities 
realized gains for the year ended december  were partially offset by the other than temporary impairments in  totaling million

commission expense decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to a million increase in the lpt contingent profit commission  partially offset by increased commission expense from our acquired subsidiaries 
excluding the impact of the lpt contingent profit commission  commission expense would have been and of net premiums earned for the years ended december  and  respectively 
dividends to policyholders increased million for the year ended  primarily due to policyholders dividend plans in florida and wisconsin  which are administered pricing states 
underwriting and other operating expenses increased for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  primarily related to the acquired operations of amcomp 
the increase included a million increase in compensation expense largely a result of the acquisition  a million increase in premium taxes  and million increase in bad debt expense 
additionally  during the year ended december   we incurred total net one time integration and restructuring charges of million  including million in severance expenses related to our corporate restructuring

income taxes decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the same period of the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of transactions that decreased income taxes related to the final reversal of the liability for previously unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million  including interest  and the reduction of tax exempt reserves in the amount of million 
these comparative increases were mostly offset by an million decrease in pre tax income  the impact of tax exempt investment income and the lpt contingent profit commission of million  which is not subject to tax

while we expect the levels of tax exempt investment income to remain relatively stable during  we cannot be certain how changes to pre tax income may ultimately impact our effective rate in future periods 
combined ratio the combined ratio increased percentage points for the year ended december   to  compared to for the increase was primarily due to the decrease of the favorable prior accident year loss development year over year and the result of lower premiums earned for the period due to rate reductions in certain markets  competitive pressures  and overall economic conditions  partially offset by the increase in the lpt contingent profit commission

the increase is comprised primarily of additional expenses resulting from the acquired operations of amcomp 
in  there was an increase of million in salaries and related benefits  including annual salary increases  increased benefit costs for medical coverage and expenses related to the equity and incentive plans 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction of million in premium taxes as a result of lower net premiums earned and a million decrease in professional fees due to one time consulting fees related to our sarbanes oxley act compliance and the conversion from a mutual insurance holding company to a stock company in in  income taxes decreased million compared to the year ended december  this was due to a decrease in the effective tax rate for the twelve months ended december   to compared to for the same period in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a change of million for the final reversal of the liability for previously unrecognized tax benefit  including interest  and the reduction in reserves for periods prior to the privatization of the fund  which were tax exempt 
combined ratio the combined ratio increased by percentage points for the year ended december   to compared to for the year ended december  overall the increase in the combined ratio was the result of lower premium 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash and short term investments parent company 
we are a holding company and substantially all of our operations have historically been conducted through our insurance subsidiaries  eicn and ecic 
on october   we completed the acquisition of amcomp and  as a result  added two new insurance subsidiaries epic and eac 
we require cash to pay any dividends to our stockholders  repurchase common stock  make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations and to fund our operating expenses 
the ability of ehi to fund its operations is contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and their ability to pay dividends to ehi 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  see item business regulation financial  dividend and investment restrictions for a further discussion of the restrictions and requirements pertaining to the availability of additional dividends 
based on reported capital  surplus and dividends paid within the last months  the maximum dividends that may be paid by eicn and epic in without prior approval by the respective state insurance regulator are million and million  respectively 
the maximum that could be paid in by our insurance subsidiaries to ehi was million 
on july   a dividend of million was paid by epic to employers group  inc egi  its immediate holding company  and subsequently from egi to ehi 
in the nevada commissioner approved extraordinary dividends totaling million from special surplus by eicn 
on november   the ehi board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of the company s common stock the program 
shares may be purchased at prevailing market prices from january  through december  through a variety of methods  including open market or private transactions  in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors  including the share price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market and economic conditions 
repurchases under the program may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice  and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
in february  ehi s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program the program 
the program authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock through june  in february  the board of directors extended this program through december  from inception of the program through december   we repurchased  shares of common stock  at the average price paid including commissions of per share  for a total of approximately million 
on september   we entered into a second amendment to the amended credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association amended credit facility  previously amended on may   under which we borrowed million to facilitate the acquisition of amcomp and for general corporate purposes 
the amended credit facility provided us with a million line of credit through december   b million line of credit from january  through december   and c million line of credit from january  through march  amounts outstanding bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option a a fluctuating rate of above prime rate or b a fixed rate that is above the libor rate then in effect 
the amended credit facility is secured by fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents that had a fair value of million at december  the amended credit facility contains customary non financial covenants and requires us to maintain million of cash and cash equivalents at all times at the holding company 
we are currently in compliance with all applicable covenants 
on december   in accordance with the terms of the contract  we repaid million of the line of credit provided by the amended credit facility 
the principal balance outstanding was million at december  in connection with the borrowing  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for an interest rate of on the notional amount of million through september  the final million bears interest at a fluctuating rate based on libor plus operating subsidiaries 
the primary sources of cash for our insurance operating subsidiaries are funds generated from underwriting operations  investment income and maturities of investments 
our primary use of cash is to pay claims and operating expenses  to purchase investments  and the payment of dividends to the parent holding company as regulated by state insurance laws  item business regulation financial  dividend and investment restrictions 
our net cash flows are generally invested in marketable securities 
we closely monitor the duration of our investments and investment purchases  and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available for the payment of claims at the subsidiary level and for the subsidiaries to pay dividends to ehi 
because our investment strategy focuses on asset and liability durations  and not on cash flows  asset sales may be required to satisfy obligations or rebalance asset portfolios 
at december   our investment portfolio had an effective duration of  as compared to at december   with individual maturities extending out years 
the availability of cash to pay claims comes from our disciplined underwriting and pricing standards and the purchase of reinsurance to protect us against the costs of severe claims and catastrophic events 
on july   we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through june  the reinsurance program consists of two agreements  one excess of loss agreement and one catastrophic loss agreement 
the reinsurance program provides coverage up to million per loss occurrence  subject to certain exclusions 
our loss retention for the program year beginning july   is million 
the coverage is subject to an aggregate loss cession limitation in the first layer million in excess of our million retention of million 
additionally  in the second through fifth layers of our reinsurance program  our ultimate net loss shall not exceed million for any one life  and we are permitted one reinstatement for each layer upon the payment of additional premium 
we believe that our reinsurance program meets our needs and that we are sufficiently capitalized for the above described retention 
our insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has a risk based capital rbc standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net premiums written 
insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action 
as of december   the last date that we were required to update the annual rbc calculation  our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted statutory surplus in excess of the prescribed rbc requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action 
our insurance subsidiaries are required to have securities on deposit for the protection of injured workers in accordance with various state laws and regulations 
at december   investments with a fair value of million were on deposit to comply with such laws and regulations 
based on december   statutory financial statements  we were able to reduce our california deposits by approximately million in the third quarter of as of december   we had cash  short term investments and fixed maturity securities that will mature over the next months of approximately million 
we intend to repay million of the line of credit provided by the amended credit facility on december  and march  other capital expenditures may include such things as stock repurchases  future stockholder dividends  and support of our growth strategy 
we believe that our liquidity needs over the next months will be met with cash from operations  maturing investments and prudent use of our credit 
cash flows we monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels 
we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed 
the table below shows our recent net cash flows for the years ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of items increasing net cash provided by operations included increased net premiums received of million  increased investment income of million  decreased other assets and liabilities that provided a net million in cash  decreased income taxes paid of million and an income tax refund of million  and cash received on the lpt contingent commission of million 
items decreasing net cash provided by operations included increased payments for losses and lae of million  underwriting and other operating expenses of million  policyholder dividends of million  commission paid of million  and interest paid of million on the amended credit facility and surplus notes 
a portion of the increase in underwriting expenses paid was related to one time integration and restructuring expenses incurred for the year ended net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million of net cash used for the same period of the prior year 
the difference was primarily attributable to the purchase of amcomp in the amount of million 
also  we used proceeds from maturities and redemptions of investments primarily for the repurchase of our common stock 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million of net cash provided for the same period in the majority of cash used by financing activities was to repurchase approximately million of our common stock and to pay down million of the line of credit provided by the amended credit facility 
in  cash was provided by proceeds from our amended credit facility  which was later used for the acquisition of amcomp 
investing activities resulted in net cash used of million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided of million in the majority of cash used by investing activities was million for the acquisition of amcomp 
this was partially offset by million of cash and cash equivalents received in the acquisition and lower net purchases of securities 
financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended compared to net cash used of million for in  the amended credit facility provided million that was primarily used to finance the acquisition of amcomp 
additionally  stock repurchases were reduced to million from million in this was offset by million cash provided by our ipo in investments as of december   the amortized cost of our investment portfolio was billion and the fair value was billion 
we employ an investment strategy that emphasizes asset quality and considers the durations of fixed maturity securities against anticipated claim payments and expenditures or other liabilities 
the amounts and types of our investments are governed by statutes and regulations in states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically over time in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
currently  we make claim payments from positive cash flow from operations and use excess cash to invest in operations  invest in marketable securities  return capital to our stockholders and fund our growth strategy 
at december   our investment portfolio  which is classified as available for sale  was made up almost entirely of investment grade fixed maturity securities whose fair values may fluctuate due to interest rate changes 
we strive to limit interest rate risk by managing the duration of our fixed maturity securities 
as of december   our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of 
to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
we strive to limit credit risk by investing in a fixed maturity securities portfolio that is heavily weighted toward short term to intermediate term investment grade securities rated a or better 
our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio shall be aa 
as of december   our fixed maturity securities portfolio had an average quality of aa  with approximately of the market value rated aa or better 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  changes in market prices of the equity securities we hold in our combined investment portfolio result in increases or decreases in our total assets 
in order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk  we invest primarily in equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and seek to diversify our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
our objective during the past few years has been to reduce equity exposure as a percentage of our total portfolio by increasing our fixed maturity securities 
our investment strategy allows a maximum exposure of of our total combined investment portfolio in equity securities  with our current target at of the total portfolio 
at december   the equity allocation of our investment portfolio was 
given the economic uncertainty and continued market volatility  we believe our asset allocation best meets our strategy to preserve capital for policyholders  provide sufficient income to support insurance operations  and to effectively grow book value over a long term investment horizon 
our investment guidelines have been adjusted to meet our consolidated business strategy 
the revised guidelines incorporate lower fixed income duration parameters  a reduction in our equity target  a lower target weight for the tax exempt municipal fixed income sector and revised benchmark compositions 
our overall investment philosophy is to maximize total investment returns within the constraints of prudent portfolio management 
the asset allocation is reevaluated by the finance committee of the board of directors at a detailed level on a quarterly basis 
we employ conning asset manager conning to act as our independent investment manager 
conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our board of directors 
in addition to the construction and management of the portfolio  we utilize the investment advisory services of conning 
these services include investment accounting and company modeling using dynamic financial analysis dfa 
the dfa tool is utilized in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives  which in turn  is used in constructing an optimal portfolio 
the following table shows the fair value  the percentage of the fair value to total invested assets and the tax equivalent yield based on the fair value of each category of invested assets as of december  category fair value percentage of total yield in thousands  except percentages us treasuries us agencies states and municipalities corporate securities residential mortgaged backed securities commercial mortgaged backed securities asset backed securities equity securities total investments weighted average yield the average credit rating for our fixed maturity securities investment portfolio  using ratings assigned by standard poor s  was aa at december  the following table shows the standard poor s ratings distribution of our fixed maturity securities portfolio as of december  as a percentage of total market value rating percentage of total market value aaa aa a bbb total we regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management 
all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a decline is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost  historical and projected company financial performance and near term prospects of the issuer  the outlook for industry sectors  credit ratings and macro economic changes and our intent on not selling the securities and that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before their fair value recovers above cost  or to maturity 
for the year ended december   we recognized a total impairment of million in the fair value of equity securities in our portfolio as a result of the severity and duration of the decline in market value of these securities primarily due to market conditions 
none of our fixed maturity securities were impaired in for the year ended december   we recognized a total impairment of million in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the fair value of equity securities was impaired million as a result of the severity and duration of the decline in market value of these securities primarily due to market conditions 
our fixed maturity securities were impaired million due to the credit downgrade and increased credit risk of the issuer 
based on our review of fixed maturity and equity securities in the tables below  we believe that we have appropriately identified the declines in the fair values of our unrealized losses at december  and we determined that the remaining unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily the result of the interest rate environment and not the credit quality of the issuers 
we also determined that the remaining unrealized losses on equity securities were not considered to be other than temporary due to the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuers

at december  and  securities having a fair market value of million and million  respectively  were on deposit 
these laws and regulations govern the amount  and type of fixed maturity security that is eligible for deposit 
additionally  certain reinsurance contracts require company funds to be held in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities assumed by us 
the fair value of securities held in trust for reinsurance at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the amended credit facility is secured by fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents with fair values of million and million at december  and  and requires that we maintain a minimum million cash balance

as a result  our calculation of loss and lae reserve payments by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of reserves and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our reserving process  see critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
actual payments of losses and lae by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of losses and lae reserves vary from actual ultimate claims amounts as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk 
we currently have no exposure to foreign currency risk 
credit risk investments our fixed maturity securities portfolio is exposed to credit risk  which we attempt to manage through issuer and industry diversification 
we regularly monitor our overall investment results and review compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines 
our investment guidelines include limitations on the minimum rating of fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio  as well as restrictions on investments in fixed maturity securities of a single issuer 
as of december   all but one of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio were rated investment grade by the securities valuation office of the naic or by standard poor s  moody s or fitch 
reinsurance we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
although our reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have reinsured 
as a result  reinsurance agreements do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims to policyholders and we may not recover claims made to our reinsurers 
we address this credit risk by selecting reinsurers with an am best rating of a or better and by performing credit reviews on our reinsurers 
the am best ratings of our reinsurance carriers as of december  are set forth in this report under item business reinsurance 
interest rate risk credit facilities and third party surplus notes our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates applies to the interest expense of variable rate debt under our bank credit facility and our insurance subsidiaries surplus notes issued to unaffiliated third parties 
the interest rates we pay increase and decrease with changes to libor 
we have utilized  and may continue to utilize  derivative products such as interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
investments our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities that were classified as available for sale as of december  the primary market risk exposure to our fixed maturity securities portfolio is interest rate risk  which we strive to limit by managing duration 
as of december   our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of 
interest rate risk includes the risk that a security s value will change due to a change in interest rates 
for example  the fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by instructing our investment manager to select fixed maturity securities consistent with our investment strategy 
to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
we continually monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our liquidity obligations 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  we select a hypothetical change in market rates that reflects what we believe are reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any action that we may take to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
for invested assets  we use modified duration modeling to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put  and interest rate reset features 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  excluding accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value on our fixed maturity securities including short term investments  valued at billion as of december   based on specific changes in interest rates changes in interest rates estimated increase decrease in fair value in thousands  except percentages basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise basis point decline basis point decline the sensitivity analysis model produces a predicted pre tax loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million  or based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss amount reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of our fixed maturity securities and short term investments  which constituted approximately of our total invested assets as of december  with respect to investment income  the most significant assessment of the effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on investment income would be based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases fas  issued by the fasb  which requires amortization adjustments for mortgage backed securities 
the rates at which the mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities are prepaid  and therefore the average life of mortgage backed securities  can vary depending on changes in interest rates for example  mortgages are prepaid faster and the average life of mortgage backed securities falls when interest rates decline 
the adjustments for changes in amortization  which are based on revised average life assumptions  would have an impact on investment income if a significant portion of our mortgage backed securities were purchased at significant discounts or premiums to par value 
the guidance for fas may now be found in the new codification as a component of fasb asc topic as of december   the par value of our mortgage backed securities holdings was million 
amortized cost is of par value 
since a majority of our mortgage backed securities were purchased at a premium or discount that is significant as a percentage of par  a fas adjustment could have a significant effect on investment income 
however  given the current economic conditions and prevailing interest rate environment  the rate of prepayments is unlikely to accelerate 
the mortgage backed securities portion of the portfolio totaled of total investments as of december  agency backed mortgage pass throughs totaled million  or of the mortgage backed securities portion of the portfolio  and of the total portfolio as of december  equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio result in decreases in the value of our total assets 
in order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk  we invest primarily in the equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and seek to diversify our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
in addition  we currently limit the percentage of equity securities held in our investment portfolio to or less of our total investment portfolio 
at december   equity securities had a fair value of million  or of our investment portfolio 
the table below shows the sensitivity to price changes of our equity securities owned as of december  cost fair value fair value decrease pre tax impact on total equity securities fair value increase pre tax impact on total equity securities in thousands domestic equities total effects of inflation the effects of inflation could impact our financial statements and results of operations 
our estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses include assumptions about future payments for closure of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established  we will be required to increase reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses with a corresponding reduction in our earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
we consider inflation in the reserving process by reviewing cost trends and our historical reserving results 
additionally  an actuarial estimate of increased costs is considered in setting adequate rates  especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded general inflation rates 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including payrolls  are impacted to a certain degree by the inflation rate
