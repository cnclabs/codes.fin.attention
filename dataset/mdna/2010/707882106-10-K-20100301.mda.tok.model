overview of business we are an independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the development  exploration and production of natural gas and oil in various domestic onshore regions including east texas  the mid continent  appalachia and mississippi 
we also indirectly own partner interests in pvr  which is engaged in the coal and natural resource management and natural gas midstream businesses 
our ownership interests in pvr are held principally through our general partner interest and our limited partner interest in pvg 
as of december   pvg owned an approximately limited partner interest in pvr and of the general partner of pvr  which holds a general partner interest in pvr and all of the idrs 
although results are consolidated for financial reporting  penn virginia  pvg and pvr operate with independent capital structures 
as such  cash flow available to us from pvg and pvr is only in the form of cash distributions declared and paid to us as a result of our partner interests in those entities 
we are engaged in three primary business segments i oil and gas  ii coal and natural resource management and iii natural gas midstream 
we operate our oil and gas segment  and pvr operates the coal and natural resource management and natural gas midstream segments 
key developments during  the following general business developments and corporate actions had an impact upon the financial reporting of our results of operations and financial position as well as the overall presentation of financial information i the effect of commodity prices on our drilling program  ii disposition of gulf coast properties  which was completed in january  iii entrance into a new credit facility and the issuance of senior notes  iv sale of million pvg units  v common stock offering of million shares  vi organization restructuring and vii implementation of an accounting standard update with respect to our convertible senior subordinated notes  or convertible notes 
a discussion of these key developments follows commodity prices and impact on drilling program beginning in the latter part of and continuing into  the domestic energy markets experienced a precipitous decline in commodity prices including those for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  among others 
accordingly  these conditions led to our decision at the beginning of to significantly reduce our drilling program 
in addition to the significant impact on revenues directly attributable to lower commodity prices  we incurred certain material costs associated with the suspension of our drilling program 
the effect on revenues and a more thorough analysis of delayed drilling costs is provided in results of operations oil and gas segment below 
energy markets and related commodity prices improved in the second half of  providing support for our decision to significantly increase the expected size of our drilling program in as compared to disposition of gulf coast properties in december  we signed agreements to complete the sale of our gulf coast properties in exchange for million of net cash proceeds and certain oil and gas properties in the selma chalk play in our mississippi region  excluding transaction costs and purchase and sale adjustments 
the transaction closed on january  during  we recorded total asset impairments of million in connection with the classification of these properties as held for sale 
additional information is provided in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
completion of a new credit facility and the issuance of senior notes in november  we entered into the revolver  which is a new credit agreement that provides for a million revolving credit facility commitment against a million borrowing base  and includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit as well as an option to increase the commitments 
table of contents under the revolver by up to an additional million 
the credit facility is secured by our reserves 
the initial borrowing base of million was subsequently reduced to million in connection with the gulf coast property sale discussed above 
in june  we issued million of senior unsecured notes  or senior notes  which will mature on june  the senior notes were sold at of par and provided proceeds of million  net of original issue discount and issuance costs 
additional information regarding the revolver and the senior notes is provided in the discussion of liquidity and capital resources that follows as well as note to the consolidated financial statements

common stock offering of million shares in may  we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock in a registered public offering that provided million of net proceeds 
additional information is provided in the liquidity and capital resources discussion that follows as well as note to the consolidated financial statements 
organization restructuring in november  we implemented an organization restructuring that will result in the transfer of certain corporate and oil and gas accounting and administrative functions from our kingsport  tennessee office location to our houston  texas and radnor  pennsylvania locations 
in addition  the restructuring will result in the relocation of our eastern region oil and gas divisional office from kingsport to a new office in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
approximately employees will be terminated in connection with the restructuring plans and we anticipate incurring approximately million in costs including termination benefits  relocation costs and other incremental costs associated with expanding our other office locations 
additional information is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
retrospective application of change in accounting principle for convertible notes effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard regarding convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement with respect to our convertible notes 
the change in accounting principle  as applied retrospectively to all periods presented  resulted in adjustments to the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the years ended december  and  respectively  as well as the consolidated balance sheet as of december  additional information is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows although results are consolidated for financial reporting  penn virginia  pvg and pvr operate with independent capital structures 
with the exception of cash distributions paid to us by pvg and pvr  the cash needs of each entity have been met independently with a combination of operating cash flows  asset sales  credit facility borrowings and the issuance of common stock and new pvg and pvr units 
we expect that our cash needs and the cash needs of pvg and pvr will continue to be met independently of each other with a combination of these funding sources 
with respect to penn virginia excluding the sources and uses of capital by pvg and pvr  we satisfy our working capital requirements and fund our capital expenditures using cash generated from our operations  asset sales  borrowings under the revolver and proceeds from common stock offerings 
we satisfy our debt service obligations and dividend payments solely using cash generated from our operations 
we believe that the cash generated from our operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our 
table of contents working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major capital improvements or acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and dividend payments 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and planned expenditures will depend on our future operating performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions in the commodity markets of oil and natural gas  some of which are beyond our control 
pvr s ability to satisfy its obligations and planned expenditures will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry and natural gas midstream market  some of which are beyond pvr s control

table of contents cash flows from operating activities consistent with the oil and gas segment s operating performance  our cash flows from operating activities reflected significant declines in commodity prices for our products partially offset by lower cash operating expenses and severance taxes as well as lower working capital utilization primarily attributable to a significantly reduced drilling program 
also  mitigating the decline in cash revenues during was the net cash received from our derivatives portfolio 
our derivatives provided approximately million in cash receipts during as compared to net cash payments of approximately million during excluding the impact of derivatives settlements  pvg s cash flows from operating activities declined by approximately million during as compared to consistent with a decline in the pvr natural gas midstream segment s gross margin despite higher system throughput 
in addition  the pvr natural gas midstream segment incurred higher cash operating expenses primarily attributable to operating a more expanded network during resulting from acquisitions and other expansions in recent prior years 
also contributing to lower net cash flows from operating activities was a decline in the pvr coal and natural resource management segment s revenues partially offset by a proportionate decline in cash operating expenses 
with respect to derivatives  pvr received approximately million in cash receipts during as compared to net cash payments of approximately million during cash flows from investing activities the cash used by both us and pvr in investing activities were primarily for capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of certain properties and equipment 
consistent with economic conditions during  we significantly reduced our drilling program and pvr reduced its capital additions and acquisition activities

cash flows from financing activities during  we issued the senior notes which provided proceeds of million  net of an original issue discount and issuance costs and sold million shares of our common stock in a registered public offering providing net proceeds of million 
in addition  we sold million units of pvg owned by us for net proceeds of million resulting in a reduction of our limited partner interest in pvg from to 
these proceeds were used primarily to eliminate our borrowings under the revolver 
during  we had net borrowings of million under the revolver during  pvr had net borrowings of million under its revolving credit agreement  or pvr revolver  which was primarily used to fund pvr s capital expenditures program 
in connection with the revolver  the increase in the capacity of the pvr revolver and the issuance of our senior notes  a total of million was paid in in issuance costs and fees 
during  pvr had net borrowings of million primarily attributable to the pvr revolver offset by the repayment of pvr s senior unsecured notes due pvr also received net proceeds of million from the sale of its common units in a registered public offering in  which was comprised of net proceeds of million from the sale of the common units to the public and million in contributions from its general partner to maintain its general partner interest in pvr 
these increases were partially offset by increased cash distributions paid to pvr s and pvg s partner s due to increases in the distributions paid per unit as well as the increase in pvr s outstanding common units resulting from the unit offering

in november  we entered into the revolver and simultaneously terminated our previous credit agreement 
the revolver provides for a million revolving credit facility and matures in november we have the option to increase the commitments under the revolver by up to an additional million upon the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders 
the revolver is governed by a borrowing base calculation and the availability under the revolver may not exceed the lesser of the aggregate commitments and the borrowing base 
the initial borrowing base was million and was reduced to million in connection with the sale of our gulf coast properties as discussed previously 
the revolver is available to us for general purposes including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions and includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolver bear interest  at our option  at either i a rate derived from the london interbank offered rate libor  as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities the adjusted libor  plus an applicable margin ranging from to or ii the greater of a the prime rate  b federal funds effective rate plus and c the one month adjusted libor plus  in each case  plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
in each case  the applicable margin is determined based on the ratio of our outstanding borrowings to the available revolver capacity 
the revolver is guaranteed by penn virginia and all of our material oil and gas subsidiaries 
the obligations under the revolver are secured by a first priority lien on a portion of our proved oil and gas reserves and a pledge of the equity interests in the guarantor subsidiaries  which excludes pvg  pvr and their subsidiaries 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolver and we had remaining borrowing capacity of up to million  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
a discussion of the applicable covenants and related compliance with respect to the revolver is provided in the discussion of financial condition that follows 
senior notes 
in june  we issued and sold million of senior notes which mature in june the senior notes were sold at of par  equating to an effective yield to maturity of approximately 
the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes of million were used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility associated with the previous credit agreement 
the senior notes are senior to our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to all of our indebtedness  including the revolver  to the extent of the collateral securing that indebtedness 
the obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our subsidiaries that guarantee our indebtedness under the revolver 

table of contents convertible notes 
in december  we issued the convertible notes with interest payable semiannually in arrears on may and november of each year 
the convertible notes are convertible into cash up to the principal amount thereof and shares of our common stock  if any  in respect of the excess conversion value  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the convertible notes which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock  subject to adjustment  and  if not converted or repurchased earlier  will mature in november the convertible notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations  ranking junior in right of payment to any of our senior indebtedness and to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and equal in right of payment to any of our future unsecured senior subordinated indebtedness 
the convertible notes will rank senior in right of payment to any of our future junior subordinated indebtedness and will structurally rank junior to all existing and future indebtedness of our guarantor subsidiaries 
in connection with the sale of the convertible notes  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions  or the note hedges  with respect to shares of our common stock with affiliates of certain of the underwriters of the convertible notes collectively  the option counterparties 
the note hedges cover  subject to anti dilution adjustments  the net shares of our common stock that would be deliverable to converting noteholders in the event of a conversion of the convertible notes 
we also entered into separate warrant transactions  or the warrants  whereby we sold to the option counterparties warrants to acquire  subject to anti dilution adjustments  approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
upon exercise of the warrants  we will deliver shares of our common stock equal to the difference between the then market price and the strike price of the warrants 
if the market value per share of our common stock at the time of conversion of the convertible notes is above the strike price of the note hedges  the note hedges entitle us to receive from the option counterparties net shares of our common stock and cash for any fractional share cash amount based on the excess of the then current market price of our common stock over the strike price of the note hedges 
additionally  if the market price of our common stock at the time of exercise of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants  we will owe the option counterparties net shares of our common stock and cash for any fractional share cash amount  not offset by the note hedges  in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of our common stock over the strike price of the warrants 
on october   one of the option counterparties  lehman brothers otc derivatives inc  or lehman otc  joined other lehman brothers entities and filed for bankruptcy protection 
we had purchased of the note hedges from lehman otc  or the lehman note hedges  for approximately million  and we had sold of the warrants to lehman otc for approximately million 
if the lehman note hedges are rejected or terminated in connection with the lehman otc bankruptcy  we would have a claim against lehman otc and possibly lehman brothers inc  as guarantor  for the damages and or close out values resulting from any such rejection or termination 
while we intend to pursue any claim for damages and or close out values resulting from the rejection or termination of the lehman note hedges  at this point in the lehman bankruptcy cases it is not possible to determine with accuracy the ultimate recovery  if any  that we may realize on potential claims against lehman otc or its affiliated guarantor resulting from any rejection or termination of the lehman note hedges 
we also do not know whether lehman otc will assume or reject the lehman note hedges  and therefore cannot predict whether lehman otc intends to perform its obligations under the lehman note hedges 
if lehman otc does not perform such obligations and the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price as adjusted of the convertible notes  our existing shareholders would experience dilution at the time or times the convertible notes are converted 
the extent of any such dilution would depend  among other things  on the then prevailing market price of our common stock and the number of shares of common stock then outstanding  but we believe the impact will not be material and will not affect our income statement presentation 
we are not otherwise exposed to counterparty risk related to the bankruptcies of lehman brothers inc or its affiliates and do not believe that the lehman bankruptcies will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents interest rate swaps 
in december  we entered into an a new interest rate swap agreement  or new interest rate swap  to establish variable rates on a portion of the outstanding obligation under the senior notes 
the notional amount of the new interest rate swap is million  or approximately one third of the face amount outstanding under the senior notes 
we will pay a variable rate equivalent to the three month libor plus a margin of  and the counterparties will pay a fixed rate of 
the term of the new interest rate swap extends through june in addition to the new interest rate swap  we previously entered into interest rate swaps agreements  or the previous interest rate swaps  to establish fixed rates on a portion of the previously outstanding borrowings under the revolver until december the notional amounts of the previous interest rate swaps total million 
we pay a weighted average fixed rate of on the notional amount  and the counterparties pay a variable rate equal to the three month libor 
as there are currently no amounts outstanding under the revolver  we entered into an offsetting fixed to floating interest rate swap in december that effectively unwinds the previous interest rate swaps 
with respect to this fixed to floating interest rate swap  we pay a variable rate equivalent to the three month libor and the counterparties will pay a fixed rate of until december long term debt of pvr 
as of december   the long term debt of pvr was solely attributable to the pvr revolver

this sale resulted in the realization of additional net proceeds of million in january as well as the receipt of certain oil and gas properties in mississippi 
these gulf coast properties were classified as assets held for sale and are reflected as such on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition covenant compliance the terms of the revolver require us to maintain certain financial covenants 
these covenants  which are effective with the period ended december   are as follows total debt to ebitdax  each as defined in the revolver  for any four consecutive quarters may not exceed to reducing to to for periods ending on or after september  both total debt and ebitdax excludes those items of pvg and pvr as they are not guarantor subsidiaries under the revolver 
ebitdax  which is a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measure  generally means net income plus interest expense  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  exploration expenses  impairments  other non cash charges or losses and the amount of cash distributions received from pvg and pvr 
the current ratio  as of the last day of any quarter  may not be less than to the current ratio is generally defined as current assets to current liabilities 
for purposes of this ratio  the revolver essentially excludes the current assets and current liabilities of pvg and pvr as they are not guarantor subsidiaries 
current assets and current liabilities attributable to derivative instruments are also excluded 
in addition  current assets include the amount of any unused commitment under the revolver 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the revolver s covenants 
the financial covenants of the pvr revolver are as follows total debt to consolidated ebitda may not exceed to ebitda  which is a non gaap measure  is generally defined in the pvr revolver as pvr s net income plus interest expense  net of interest income  depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  and non cash hedging activity and impairments

should the banks deny our or pvr s appeal to waive the covenant default  the outstanding borrowings under the revolver or the pvr revolver would become payable on demand and would be reclassified as a component of current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  both the revolver and the pvr revolver impose limitations on dividends and distributions  as well as limit the ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make certain loans  acquisitions and investments  make any material change to the nature of our or pvr s business or enter into a merger or sale of our or pvr s assets  including the sale or transfer of interests in our or pvr s subsidiaries 
future capital needs and commitments subject to commodity prices and the availability of capital  we expect to expand our oil and gas operations over the next several years by continuing to execute a program dominated by development drilling and  to a lesser extent  exploration drilling  supplemented periodically with property and reserve acquisitions 
in  we anticipate making oil and gas segment capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of up to approximately million 
the capital expenditures are expected to be primarily funded from internally generated sources of cash  including cash distributions received from pvg and pvr  supplemented by revolver borrowings and proceeds from the sale of non core assets and the sale of part or all of our interests in pvg 
at december   we had million of cash and million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolver 
we continually review drilling and other capital expenditure plans and may change the amount we spend in any area based on industry conditions  cash flows provided by operating activities and the availability of capital 
for future periods  we continue to assess funding needs for our growth opportunities in the context of our presently available debt capacity 
we expect to continue to use a combination of cash flows from operating activities and debt financing  supplemented with equity issuances and the sale of other non core assets  potentially including all or part of our interests in pvg  to fund our growth 
pvr believes that its remaining borrowing capacity of million will be sufficient for its capital needs and commitments 
pvr s short term cash requirements for operating expenses and quarterly distributions to pvg  as the owner of pvr s general partner  and unitholders are expected to be funded through operating cash flows 
in  pvr anticipates making capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of up to million 
the majority of these capital expenditures are expected to be incurred in the pvr natural gas midstream segment 
pvr intends to fund these capital expenditures with a combination of operating cash flows and borrowings under the pvr revolver 
long term cash requirements for acquisitions and other capital expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flows  borrowings under the pvr revolver and the issuances of additional debt and equity securities if available under commercially acceptable terms 
part of pvr s long term strategy is to increase cash available for distribution to pvr s unitholders by making acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
pvr s ability to make these acquisitions and other capital expenditures in the future will depend largely on the availability of debt financing and on pvr s ability to periodically use equity financing through the issuance of new common units 
future financing will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates and pvr s financial condition and credit rating

total contractual obligations do not include anticipated capital expenditures 
part of the purchase price for the pvr lone star acquisition includes contingent payments of approximately million 
these contingency payments will be made by pvr if certain revenue targets are met before june  because the outcome of these contingent payments is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt  pvr did not accrue these contingent payments as a liability during the year ended december  rather  once the revenue targets are met  the contingent payments will be recorded as an additional cost of the lone star acquisition 
off balance sheet arrangements we may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we or pvr have entered into included operating lease arrangements  drilling commitments  firm transportation agreements  and letters of credit  all of which are customary in our and pvr s business 
see contractual obligations summarized above for more details related to the value of off balance sheet arrangements 
neither we nor pvr had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

year ended december  favorable unfavorable change east texas    appalachia    mid continent    mississippi    gulf coast    total revenues    approximately and of total production in the years ended december  and was natural gas 
total production increased primarily due to continued development of the granite wash play in the mid continent region and the horizontal selma chalk play in mississippi 
our appalachian production was relatively consistent with the prior year 
we have deferred drilling in the east texas region until early and we were in the process of exiting all of our activities in the gulf coast region during the fourth quarter of in  we drilled a total of gross net wells  including gross net development wells and gross net exploratory wells 
all wells were successful except gross net development wells  including gross net development wells under evaluation at december  our operations include both conventional and unconventional developmental drilling opportunities  as well as some exploratory prospects 
we recently shifted our focus to the lower bossier haynesville shale play  which we believe has increased proved reserves and production levels 
in this east texas play  we drilled gross net wells  including gross net successful wells 
we also have unconventional development programs in the mid continent region where we drilled gross net wells  including gross net successful wells  primarily in the granite wash and woodford shale plays 
in the selma chalk play in mississippi and appalachian region  we drilled gross net wells all of which were successful

revenue variance due to volume price total natural gas    crude oil    ngl    our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  which are affected by numerous factors that are generally beyond our control 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
natural gas prices are influenced by national and regional supply and demand 
a substantial or extended decline in the price of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and cash flow and could  under certain circumstances  result in an impairment of some of our oil and natural gas properties 
our future profitability and growth are also highly dependent on the results of our exploratory and development drilling programs 
effects of derivatives our natural gas and crude oil revenues may change significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or production volumes 
as part of our risk management strategy  we use derivative financial instruments to hedge natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil prices 
for the derivatives related to the oil and gas segment  we received million in cash settlements in and we paid cash settlements of million in the following table reconciles natural gas and crude oil revenues to realized prices  as adjusted for derivative activities  for the periods presented

year ended december  favorable unfavorable change dry hole costs    geological and geophysical   unproved leasehold    standby rig charges   n a other    in  dry hole costs and geological and geophysical expenses were significantly decreased due to our reduced drilling program 
in  the dry hole costs were primarily due to the write off of six wells in the appalachian region  which were non economic 
unproved leasehold expense increased primarily as a result of a change we made to our accounting process in to amortize additional insignificant unproved properties over the average estimated life of the leases rather than amortizing some leases and assessing other leases on an occurrence basis 
in conjunction with the drilling program reduction  we amended certain drilling rig contracts to delay commencement of drilling until january as a result  in we recognized standby rig charges for cancellation fees  minimum daily standby fees and demobilization fees as a component of exploration expenses 
other expenses increased due to increased delay rentals in the gulf coast region primarily related to lease renewals on certain prospects 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a expenses increased approximately million due to the increase in equivalent production and approximately million due to higher depletion rates which were caused by higher cost wells being drilled 
our average depletion rate increased by per mcfe  or  from per mcfe in to per mcfe in impairments impairment charges in includes million attributable to assets that were sold during or held for sale as of december  the most significant of these related to our gulf coast properties in texas and louisiana as well as certain properties in north dakota 
the sale of our north dakota properties was completed in the fourth quarter of and the sale of our gulf coast properties was completed in january see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the gulf coast assets held for sale 
other impairment charges during include million for re evaluation related to our tubular inventory due to decline in market value and million of other impairments 
impairment charges in related to declines in spot and future oil and gas prices which reduced the estimated reserve bases of fields on certain properties in the mid continent and appalachian regions 
these changes in reserve estimates in were primarily due to a decrease in fourth quarter oil and gas prices and a decline in well performance

the increased production in the east texas region is due primarily to aggressive drilling and additional processing for sales points which were previously sold as wet gas  but are now processed through pvr s crossroads plant  which was placed into service in april in  we drilled a successful horizontal lower bossier haynesville shale well in harrison county  texas 
based on this successful horizontal test  we had four rigs drilling horizontal lower bossier haynesville shale wells as of december  the decrease in the appalachian region is due primarily to the sale of oil and gas royalty interests to pvr in october production in the mississippi region was relatively constant from to the increase in production in the mid continent region is due primarily to higher cbm production and high production wells in the granite wash and woodford shale areas 
the decrease in production in the gulf coast region is due primarily to decreased natural gas production resulting from depletion of certain prospects within that region 
in addition  the gulf coast region  particularly the bayou postillion area  experienced disruptions in production due to inclement weather

pvr s coal royalties expense is incurred primarily in the central appalachian region 
revenues coal royalties revenues decreased slightly due to the decrease in the average coal royalty received per ton 
this decrease was due to an overall shift in production mix to lower royalty lessees  primarily to fixed rate leases in the san juan basin from the higher royalty central appalachian region 

table of contents coal production by pvr s lessees increased slightly due to higher production in the san juan basin resulting from the start up of a second mine and improved mining conditions 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in production in the central appalachian region which was due to a reduction in longwall mining activity and a depressed coal market 
timber revenues decreased due to lower sales prices resulting from weakened market conditions for furniture grade wood products 
the average price received by pvr for timber decreased from per mbf in to per mbf in the oil and gas royalty revenues decrease was primarily attributable to lower natural gas prices in realized prices received for natural gas decreased from per mcf in to per mcf in other revenues  which consisted primarily of wheelage fees  forfeiture income and management fees  decreased due to lower wheelage income from a decline in coal production in certain areas 
in addition  in  a million gain on the settlement of unmined coal was recognized 
expenses coal royalties expenses decreased due to a decline in mining activity by pvr s lessees from subleased properties in the central appalachian region where pvr s coal royalties expense is primarily incurred 
mining activity on pvr s subleased property fluctuates between periods due to the proximity of pvr s property boundaries and other mineral owners 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of an uncollectible account receivable resulting from a pvr lessee bankruptcy and increased staffing and related benefit costs 
the million impairment expense in was the result of a reduction in the value of an intangible asset 
pvr tests long lived assets for impairment if a triggering event occurs and the impairment was triggered by a wheelage contract being rejected in bankruptcy 
as a result of the impairment  the fair value of the contract has been reduced to zero 
dd a expenses increased slightly due to higher depletion expense resulting from the increase in coal mined from pvr s properties by its lessees

pvr s coal royalties expense is incurred primarily in the central appalachian region 
revenues coal royalties revenues increased as a result of higher coal prices and additional tons being mined by pvr s lessees 
coal royalty tons increased primarily due to higher production in the central appalachia and illinois basin regions  partially offset by a production decline in the northern appalachian region 
the central appalachian region increase was the result of longwall mining and the timing of additional mining equipment added to pvr s properties during the illinois basin region increase was primarily due to a full year of production in on coal reserves which were acquired by pvr in june the northern appalachian region decrease was a result of adverse longwall mining conditions 

table of contents coal prices were higher on average due to international coal shortages on both the metallurgical and steam markets  which not only drove increases in export metallurgical pricing  but also allowed some higher thermal capacity steam coal to crossover into the metallurgical market  consequently  this caused the domestic steam coal markets to tighten and resulted in higher domestic pricing 
pvr s coal royalties revenues are dependent on the prevailing coal prices received by its lessees  which are affected by numerous factors that are generally beyond pvr s control 
coal prices are generally determined by national and regional supply and demand 
timber revenues increased due to increased harvesting from pvr s september forestland acquisition 
the average price received for timber increased from per mbf in to per mbf in the oil and gas royalty revenues increase was primarily due to the increased royalties resulting from pvr s october oil and gas royalty interest acquisition from us 
realized prices received for natural gas increased from per mcf in to per mcf in other revenues increased primarily due to increased coal transportation  or wheelage  fees attributable to greater production  increased forfeiture income and the recognition of a million gain on the settlement of unmined coal 
expenses coal royalties expenses increased due to additional mining by pvr s lessees from subleased properties in the central appalachian region

these transactions do not impact the gross margin 

table of contents gross margin gross margin is the difference between pvr s natural gas midstream revenues and its cost of midstream gas purchased 
natural gas midstream revenues included residue gas sold from processing plants after ngls were removed  ngls sold after being removed from system throughput volumes received  condensate collected and sold and gathering and other fees primarily from natural gas volumes connected to pvr s gas processing plants 
cost of midstream gas purchased consisted of amounts payable to third party producers for natural gas purchased under percentage of proceeds and gas purchase keep whole contracts 
the gross margin decrease was a result of lower commodity pricing and lower fractionation  or frac spreads  partially offset by increased system throughput volumes and increased natural gas processing capacity 
frac spreads are the difference between the price of ngls sold and the cost of natural gas purchased on a per mmbtu basis 
drilling activities by producers central to pvr s natural gas gathering and processing plants were at reduced levels from the previous year due to lower natural gas prices 
however  pvr s system throughput volumes benefited from the results of drilling activity in and the first part of pvr s expansion and acquisition activity  especially in the panhandle system  has alleviated pipeline pressures and allowed pvr to move all of its gas in this region to its processing plants 
as noted above  in july pvr completed an acquisition of gas processing and residue pipeline facilities in western oklahoma 
the acquired assets included the mmcfd sweetwater plant 
additionally  pvr completed a mmcfd processing plant expansion in its spearman complex that was put into service on july  the acquired and expanded processing facilities increased pvr s processing capacity in the panhandle system to mmcfd and overall processing capacity to mmcfd 
the increased processing capacity has allowed pvr to process natural gas volumes that were being bypassed due to processing capacity constraints in the panhandle system and has alleviated pipeline pressure related volume constraints in the eastern portion of the panhandle 
during  pvr generated a majority of its gross margin from contractual arrangements under which the gross margin is exposed to increases and decreases in the price of natural gas and ngls

see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of pvr s derivatives program 
on a per mcf basis  adjusted for the impact of pvr s commodity derivative instruments  pvr s gross margin increased in by  or 
this favorable impact of commodity derivatives is a result of overall lower commodity prices during and the expiration of older derivative instruments

in addition  revenues from the joint venture have grown in due to mainline volume increases in the powder river basin 
producer services revenues decreased due to a negative relative change in the natural gas indices on which pvr s purchases and sales of natural gas are based and a decrease in marketing fees resulting from lower commodity prices 
expenses operating expenses increased due to pvr s prior and current years acquisitions  expansion projects  compressor rentals and labor costs 
increased costs for compressor rentals and labor costs were incurred due to expanding pvr s footprint in the panhandle system

income tax expense the effective tax rate for was as compared to an effective tax rate of for environmental matters extensive federal  state and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws that are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties for failure to comply 
some laws  rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
other laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas 
in addition  state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations  such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect our operations  as well as the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws  rules and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
nevertheless  changes in existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws have the potential to adversely affect our operations 

table of contents pvr s operations and those of its lessees are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
the terms of pvr s coal property leases impose liability on the relevant lessees for all environmental and reclamation liabilities arising under those laws and regulations 
the lessees are bonded and have indemnified pvr against any and all future environmental liabilities 
pvr regularly visits its coal properties to monitor lessee compliance with environmental laws and regulations and to review mining activities 
pvr s management believes that its operations and those of its lessees comply with existing laws and regulations and does not expect any material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
as of december  and  pvr s environmental liabilities were million and million  which represents pvr s best estimate of the liabilities as of those dates related to its coal and natural resource management and natural gas midstream businesses 
pvr has reclamation bonding requirements with respect to certain unleased and inactive properties 
given the uncertainty of when a reclamation area will meet regulatory standards  a change in this estimate could occur in the future 
for a summary of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to pvr s operations  see item  business government regulation and environmental matters 
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
we consider the following to be the most critical accounting policies which involve the judgment of our management 
oil and gas reserves the estimates of oil and gas reserves are the single most critical estimate included in our consolidated financial statements 
reserve estimates become the basis for determining depletive write off rates  recoverability of historical cost investments and the fair value of properties subject to potential impairments 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserve quantities  including projecting the total quantities in place  future production rates and the timing of future development expenditures 
in addition  reserve estimates of new discoveries are less precise than those of producing properties due to the lack of a production history 
accordingly  these estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at the end of the respective years 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells or undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
there are several factors which could change our estimates of oil and gas reserves 
significant rises or declines in product prices could lead to changes in the amount of reserves as production activities become more or less economical 
an additional factor that could result in a change of recorded reserves is the reservoir decline rates differing from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond our control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
additionally  we perform impairment tests when significant events occur  such as a market move to a lower price environment or a material revision to our reserve estimates 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairment charges related to our oil and gas segment properties of million  million and million 
see the discussions of results of operations oil and gas segment and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the impairment of our oil and gas properties 

table of contents oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and costs to drill exploratory wells that do not discover proved reserves are expensed as oil and gas exploration 
we will carry the costs of an exploratory well as an asset if the well found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its capitalization as a producing well and as long as we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
for certain projects  it may take us more than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploratory well and make a determination of its economic viability 
our ability to move forward on a project may be dependent on gaining access to transportation or processing facilities or obtaining permits and government or partner approval  the timing of which is beyond our control 
in such cases  exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing access to necessary facilities and access to such permits and approvals and believe that they will be obtained 
we assess the status of suspended exploratory well costs on a quarterly basis 
a portion of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the costs attributable to unproved properties were million 
we regularly assess on a property by property basis the impairment of individual unproved properties whose acquisition costs are relatively significant 
unproved properties whose acquisition costs are not relatively significant are amortized in the aggregate over the lesser of five years or the average remaining lease term 
as exploration work progresses and the reserves on significant properties are proven  capitalized costs of these properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration work is unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to the unsuccessful work will be charged to exploration expense 
the timing of any write downs of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
depreciation  depletion and amortization we determine depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the units of production method and these amounts could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves 
we compute depreciation and amortization of property and equipment using the straight line balance method over the estimated useful life of each asset 
pvr depletes coal properties on an area by area basis at a rate based on the cost of the mineral properties and the number of tons of estimated proven and probable coal reserves contained therein 
proven and probable coal reserves have been estimated by pvr s own geologists and outside consultants 
pvr s estimates of coal reserves are updated periodically and may result in adjustments to coal reserves and depletion rates that are recognized prospectively 
from time to time  pvr carries out core hole drilling activities on its coal properties in order to ascertain the quality and quantity of the coal contained in those properties 
these core hole drilling activities are expensed as incurred 
pvr depletes timber using a methodology consistent with the units of production method  but that is based on the quantity of timber harvested 
pvr determines depletion of oil and gas royalty interests by the units of production method and these amounts could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves 
when pvr retires or sells an asset  we remove its cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization from our consolidated balance sheets 
we record the difference between the net book value  net of any assumed asset retirement obligation  and proceeds from dispositions of property and equipment as a gain or loss 
intangible assets are primarily associated with assumed contracts  customer relationships and rights of way 
these intangible assets are amortized over periods of up to years  the period in which benefits are derived from the contracts  relationships and rights of way  and are combined with property  plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of our and pvr s intangible assets 
derivative activities from time to time  we and pvr enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to natural gas  crude oil and ngl price volatility 
the derivative financial instruments  which are placed with financial institutions that we believe are acceptable credit risks  take the form of collars and three way collars 

table of contents all derivative financial instruments are recognized in our consolidated financial statements at fair value 
the fair values of our derivative instruments are determined based on discounted cash flows derived from quoted forward prices 
all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy  which has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors 
we recognize changes in fair value in earnings currently in the derivatives line on the consolidated statements of income 
we have experienced and could continue to experience significant changes in the estimate of unrealized derivative gains or losses recognized due to fluctuations in the value of these commodity derivative contracts 
our results of operations are affected by the volatility of mark to market gains and losses and changes in fair value  which fluctuate with changes in natural gas  crude oil and ngl prices 
these fluctuations could be significant in a volatile pricing environment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our and pvr s derivatives programs 
new accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting standards 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risks to which we and pvr are exposed are as follows price risk interest rate risk as a result of our and pvr s risk management activities as discussed below  we are also exposed to counterparty risk with financial institutions with whom we and pvr enter into these risk management positions 
sensitivity to these risks has heightened due to the state of the global economy  including financial and credit markets 
price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil  ngls and coal 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
our and pvr s price risk management programs permit the utilization of derivative financial instruments such as futures  forwards  option contracts  costless collars  three way collars and swaps to seek to mitigate the price risks associated with fluctuations in natural gas  ngl and crude oil prices as they relate to our anticipated production and pvr s natural gas midstream business 
the derivative financial instruments are placed with major financial institutions that we and pvr believe are of acceptable credit risk 
at december   we reported a commodity derivative asset related to our oil and gas segment of million 
the contracts underlying such commodity derivatives are with four counterparties  all of which are investment grade financial institutions  and over of such commodity derivative asset is substantially concentrated with one of these counterparties 
this concentration may impact our overall credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that these counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
we neither paid nor received collateral with respect to our derivative positions 
the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk if counterparties to our derivative asset positions fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts would be equal to the fair value of the contracts as of december  no significant uncertainties related to the collectability of amounts owed to us exist with regard to these counterparties 
in  we reported consolidated net derivative gains of million 
because we and pvr no longer use hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives  we recognize changes in fair value in earnings currently in the derivatives line item on our consolidated statements of income 
we have experienced and could continue to experience significant changes in the estimate of derivative gains or losses recognized due to fluctuations in the value of our and pvr s commodity derivative contracts 
our and pvr s results of operations are affected by the volatility of unrealized gains and losses and changes in fair value  which fluctuate with changes in natural gas  crude oil and ngl prices 
these fluctuations could be significant in a volatile pricing environment

in addition  we estimate that for every per barrel increase or decrease in the crude oil price  our natural gas midstream gross margin and operating income in would increase or decrease by million 
this assumes that natural gas prices  crude oil prices and inlet volumes remain constant at anticipated levels 
these estimated changes in pvr s gross margin and operating income exclude potential cash receipts or payments in settling these derivative positions 
interest rate risk as of december   pvr had million of outstanding indebtedness under the pvr revolver  which carries a variable interest rate throughout its term 
pvr entered into the pvr interest rate swaps to establish fixed interest rates on a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the pvr revolver 
until march  the notional amounts of the pvr interest rate swaps total million  or  of pvr s outstanding indebtedness under the pvr revolver as of december   with pvr paying a weighted average fixed rate of on the notional amount  and the counterparties paying a variable rate equal to the three month libor 
from march to december  the notional amounts of the pvr interest rate swaps total million  or of pvr s outstanding indebtedness under the pvr revolver as of december   with pvr paying a weighted average fixed rate of on the notional amount  and the counterparties paying a variable rate equal to the three month libor 
from december to december  the notional amounts of the pvr interest rate swaps total million  or of pvr s outstanding indebtedness under the pvr revolver as of december   with pvr paying a weighted average fixed rate of on the notional amount  and the counterparties paying a variable rate equal to the three month libor 
the pvr interest rate swaps extend one year past the maturity of the current pvr revolver 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding under the pvr revolver net of amounts fixed through the pvr interest rate swaps as of december  would cost pvr approximately million in additional interest expense per year 

table of contents during the first quarter of  both we and pvr discontinued hedge accounting for all of the previous interest rate swaps and the pvr interest rate swaps 
accordingly  subsequent fair value gains and losses for the previous and new interest rate swaps are recognized in earnings currently 
therefore  our results of operations are affected by the volatility of changes in fair value  which fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
these fluctuations could be significant
