item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k particularly under special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
unless otherwise specified  references to notes to our consolidated financial statements are to the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of november  and and for the three year period ended november  introduction and overview discover financial services is a leading credit card issuer in the united states and an electronic payment services company 
in march  we became a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of and a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley act in connection with our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program cpp 
therefore  we are now subject to oversight  regulation and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
through our discover bank subsidiary  we offer our customers credit cards  other consumer loans and deposit products 
through our dfs services llc subsidiary and its subsidiaries  we operate the discover network  the pulse network and diners club 
the discover network operates a credit card transaction processing network for discover card branded and third party issued credit cards 
pulse operates an electronic funds transfer network  providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the pulse network with access to atms domestically and internationally  as well as point of sale terminals at retail locations throughout the us for debit card transactions 
diners club is a global payments network that grants rights to licensees  which are generally financial institutions  to issue diners club branded credit cards and or to provide card acceptance services 
our diners club business also offers transaction processing and marketing services to licensees globally 
our fiscal year ends on november of each year 
our primary revenues come from interest income earned on loan receivables  securitization income derived from the transfer of credit card loan receivables to securitization trusts and subsequent issuance of beneficial interests through securitization transactions  and fees earned from customers  merchants and issuers 
the primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs interest expense  loan loss provisions  customer rewards  and expenses incurred to grow  manage and service our loan receivables 
our business activities are funded primarily through the raising of consumer deposits  securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of both secured and unsecured debt 
in a credit card securitization  loan receivables are transferred to a securitization trust  from which beneficial interests are issued to investors 
we continue to own and service the accounts that generate the securitized loans 
the trusts utilized by us to facilitate asset securitization transactions are not our subsidiaries 
these trusts are excluded from our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
because our securitization activities qualify as sales under gaap and accordingly are not treated as secured financing transactions  we remove credit card loan receivables equal to the amount of the investors interests in securitized loans from our consolidated statements of financial condition 
as a result  asset securitizations have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements in that the portions of interest income  net charge offs and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated statements of income  however  they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions 
as described in accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations  pursuant to new accounting guidance  the securitization trusts will be consolidated in our financial statements effective december  beginning on that date  our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income  but will instead report interest income  net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt 

table of contents our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis 
managed loans consist of our on balance sheet loan portfolio  loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued 
owned loans  a subset of managed loans  refer to our on balance sheet loan portfolio and loans held for sale and include the undivided seller s interest we retain in our securitizations 
a managed basis presentation  which is not a presentation in accordance with gaap  involves reporting securitized loans with our owned loans in the managed basis statements of financial condition and reporting the earnings on securitized loans in the same manner as the owned loans instead of as securitization income 
see gaap to managed data reconciliations 
highlights net income for was billion  up from billion in  which includes billion and billion  respectively  of after tax income related to the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement described further in legal proceedings 
results for also include a billion loss related to the sale of the goldfish business in march the challenging economic environment included increasing unemployment and higher consumer bankruptcies 
as a result  net charge off rates rose steadily throughout while delinquency rates remain elevated above prior periods 
the net charge off rate for was on an owned basis on a managed basis  compared to on an owned basis in on a managed basis 
this increase in our net charge off rates resulted in a billion reduction of pretax income as compared to additionally  our over days delinquency rate at november   was on an owned basis on a managed basis  compared to on an owned basis in on a managed basis 
in response to these trends  we increased the loan loss reserve rate throughout the year  from at november  to at november  despite the challenging economic environment  we maintained a steady level of managed receivables  and ended with billion in managed loans compared to billion at the end of however  owned loans fluctuated throughout the year as a result of securitization maturities and  in the second half of  new securitization transactions 
credit card sales volumes were down in  largely due to lower gasoline prices but also due to the economic environment generally 
this decline in sales  along with a lower level of promotional rate offers  contributed to a decline in managed credit card loans  which was largely offset by billion of growth in our personal and student loan products and a lower payment rate on our credit card receivables 
during  we took actions that resulted in higher net interest yield on loan receivables  including charging higher standard annual percentage rates and substantially reducing promotional rate offers 
these actions  which were partially offset by a higher level of interest charge offs  resulted in a net interest yield on loan receivables of in on a managed basis  up from in on a managed basis 
this higher net interest yield along with a higher average level of owned loans contributed to billion in net interest income for as compared to billion in we strengthened our liquidity and capital position through a number of capital market transactions during the year in march  through our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program  we issued and sold shares of our preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock to the us treasury for approximately billion in cash and became a bank holding company  we raised million in a common stock offering of approximately million shares in july and august  we raised a total of billion in a senior debt offering in july and a subordinated debt offering in november  and our securitization trusts issued billion of asset backed securities funded under the federal reserve s term asset backed securities loan facility talf in july and september we continued to grow our direct to consumer deposits and deposit products offered through affinity relationships  ending with billion of these deposits  an increase of billion from our total funding from deposits  including brokered deposits  increased to billion in from billion in we significantly reduced our operating expenses in by reducing promotional rate balance transfer offers and related marketing expenses  lowering headcount  and implementing several cost containment initiatives 
as a result  our operating expenses decreased million  or  from 
table of contents and highlights we acquired diners club international diners club for million on june  diners club has network licensees  which are generally financial institutions  that issue diners club branded credit cards and or provide card acceptance services in over countries and territories 
we sold our uk credit card business goldfish to barclays bank plc on march  this business represented substantially all of our international card segment  which is presented in discontinued operations in this report 
on june   we spun off from morgan stanley through the distribution of shares of our common stock to holders of morgan stanley common stock 
our results of operations for the year ended november  include costs incurred as a result of the distribution of approximately million  including costs that were allocated to the international card segment  reported as discontinued operations in this report 
outlook the economic environment in was particularly challenging 
although we have seen some encouraging trends in certain economic indicators and in some of our own statistics  we have yet to see sustained economic improvement 
in the last half of  our charge off and delinquency rates continued to rise  although not as quickly as they had risen in the last half of and into the first half of  indicating that our loan losses might be approaching  but have not yet reached  their peak 
we anticipate higher credit losses in and  given the continued uncertainty regarding the economic environment and somewhat higher level of delinquencies at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the end of the previous quarter  we increased our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans to at november  additionally  our results in will not benefit from the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement and will be adversely impacted by the new credit card legislation 
see legislative and regulatory developments below for a further discussion 
we anticipate that adjustments that we made to certain aspects of our business in in response to the current economic environment and the new credit card legislation will impact our financial results 
specifically  in the third quarter  we made changes to new and existing accounts  such as increasing standard annual percentage rates and converting many accounts with fixed rates to variable rates 
the higher rates charged on standard balances along with a decline in the level of promotional rate offers during the year had a positive impact on our net interest yield on credit card loan receivables 
although the benefit of these actions will continue to accumulate in  the impact will not be as significant as in and will also be offset by all of the restrictions under the card act  as described below 
we expect to maintain our current level of loan receivables through emphasizing our cashback bonus rewards program  our customer service and our other lending products  including student and personal loans 
we also took certain actions to reduce our operating expenses in  which included reducing headcount 
we plan to invest in marketing and other initiatives to grow our deposit products and our network capabilities  but we will continue to focus on sustaining a lower level of overall operating expenses compared to prior years 
at november   we had increased our liquidity reserve  primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents  to billion  in anticipation of approximately billion of asset backed securities and deposit maturities in the first half of in  we relied principally on deposits to fund our business  experiencing billion growth in our total deposit balance at november  as compared to november   while our level of securitization borrowings from third parties declined by approximately billion 
in  we plan to continue to grow deposits  particularly direct to consumer deposits  as a percentage of our total funding by using both organic and inorganic methods 
our ability to issue asset backed securities in depends on a number of factors  including market liquidity as well as legislative and regulatory developments 
in  we issued billion of senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock to the us treasury under the cpp 
we subsequently raised a total of billion in various capital market transactions 
we also increased our capital in through growth in retained earnings 
going forward  as we continue to evaluate our capital levels  we will also evaluate our continued participation in the cpp and we intend  at the appropriate time  subject to the approval of the federal reserve  to repurchase our preferred stock from the us treasury 

table of contents in our payments business  we continue to focus on increasing global volume across the discover  pulse and diners club networks by leveraging our flexibility  network relationships and emerging payments opportunities 
this effort includes the rapid implementation of our us acceptance strategy  which is based on increasing the number of active merchants who accept discover through the numerous acquiring relationships we have built in recent years 
outside the us  we will continue to work with various diners club licensees  acquirers and other payment networks to grow volume and continue the expansion of our acceptance footprint  which includes the global cash access network we launched in in  we expect to make investments in an attempt to grow volume and market share for our payments business around the world 
accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r statement no 

in december  statement no 
was codified within the fasb accounting standards codification under section  transfers and servicing  and statement no 
was codified within section  consolidation 
for ease of reference  and to clarify between guidance applicable as of the date of the accompanying financial statements and guidance applicable to future periods  we will continue to refer to statements no 
and under their previous names within this document 
statement no 
amends the accounting for transfers of financial assets and will impact the accounting for our credit card asset securitization activities 
under statement no 
 the trusts used in our securitization transactions will no longer be exempt from consolidation 
statement no 
prescribes an ongoing assessment of our involvement in the activities of the trusts and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of the trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated on our financial statements 
the assessment under statement no 
 which became effective for us on december   will result in the consolidation of the trusts by us as of that date 
using the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by statement no 
 we expect to record a billion increase in total assets  a billion increase in total liabilities and a billion decrease in stockholders equity comprised of a billion decrease in retained earnings offset by an increase of billion in other comprehensive income 

table of contents the following table shows significant line items on our consolidated statement of financial condition on an actual and pro forma basis  the latter of which gives effect to adjustments expected to be recorded on december  in connection with adopting statements no 
and the adoption of statements no 
and requires a full consolidation of the trusts in accordance with gaap  which is different from a managed presentation 
for further discussion of these differences  see gaap to managed data reconciliations 
november  actual balance sheet november  pro forma balance sheet dollars in millions assets cash and cash equivalents restricted cash investment securities loan receivables  gross allowance for loan losses loan receivables  net amounts due from asset securitization deferred tax assets other assets total assets liabilities and stockholders equity deposits long term borrowings other liabilities total liabilities total stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity when presented in financial reports beginning in  assets and liabilities of the securitization trusts will be separately presented on the face of the balance sheet  as required by statement no 
 to reflect the facts that trust assets can be used only to settle trust obligations and that the trusts creditors or beneficial interest holders do not have recourse to the general credit of the company 
the pro forma balance sheet as of november  shown above reflects the following adjustments consolidation of billion of securitized loan receivables and the related debt issued from the trusts to third party investors  reclassification of billion of certificated retained interests classified as investment securities to loan receivables  recording of a billion allowance for loan losses  not previously required under gaap  for the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables  derecognition of the remaining billion value of the interest only strip receivable  net of tax  recorded in amounts due from asset securitization and reclassification of the remaining billion of amounts due from asset securitization to restricted cash  loan receivables and other assets  and recording of net deferred tax assets of billion  largely related to establishing an allowance for loan losses on the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables 
after adoption  our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income  but will instead report interest income  net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt 
additionally  after adoption  we will no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans will no longer receive sale accounting treatment  nor will there be any gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not 
table of contents recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing 
because our securitization transactions will be accounted for under the new accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales  the cash flows from these transactions will be presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating or investing activities 
notwithstanding this accounting treatment  our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the receivables from discover bank and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts  even in insolvency  receivership or conservatorship proceedings 
we would  however  continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in these trusts 
actions we took in the third quarter of to adjust the credit enhancement structure of the trusts had the effect of causing the assets of the trusts to be included in our risk weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes effective july as a result  the consolidation of the trusts under statement no 
on december   had a lesser impact on our regulatory capital calculations than would have otherwise been the case because much of this effect has already been reflected as a result of the trust actions 
see liquidity and capital resources funding sources securitization financing below for further discussion of these trust support actions 
however  the billion charge to retained earnings as a result of adopting statement no 
will further reduce our regulatory capital ratios  although both discover financial services and discover bank are expected to remain above well capitalized levels after the adoption of statements no 
and the following table shows our regulatory capital amounts and ratios on an actual and pro forma basis as of november   the latter of which gives effect to the estimated billion reduction of retained earnings expected to be recorded on december  in connection with adopting statements no 
and november  actual november  pro forma dollars in thousands discover financial services total capital tier capital total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio discover bank total capital tier capital total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio legislative and regulatory developments legislation addressing credit card practices in may  the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act was enacted 
the card act makes numerous changes to the truth in lending act  affecting the marketing  underwriting  pricing  billing and other aspects of the consumer credit card business 
several provisions of the card act became effective in august  but most of the requirements will become effective in february and others will become effective in august legislation has been proposed to accelerate the effective date of all of the card act provisions effective as soon as the legislation is enacted  but prospects for enactment are uncertain 
the card act and its implementing regulations prohibit interest rate increases on outstanding balances except under limited circumstances  prohibit interest rate increases on new balances during the first year an account is opened except under limited circumstances  require allocation of payments in excess of the required minimum payment to balances with the highest annual percentage rate apr before balances with a lower apr for accounts with different aprs on different balances  restrict imposition of a default apr on existing balances unless an account is days past due and require that the increased apr resulting from a default be reduced if payments are timely made for six months  
table of contents generally require days advance notice be provided prior to increasing any apr as permitted by the card act or other significant changes to account terms 
except for certain changes  the notice must include a statement of the cardholder s right to cancel the account prior to the effective date of the change  prohibit the use of the two cycle average daily balance method of calculating interest and prohibit the assessment of interest on any portion of a balance that is repaid within the grace period  require penalty fees eg  late fees and over limit fees to be reasonable and proportional to the consumer s violation of the account terms  prohibit card issuers from imposing over limit fees unless the cardholder has expressly opted in to the issuer authorizing such over limit transactions  and imposes other limits on such fees  require card issuers to review accounts at least every six months when an apr has been increased to determine whether the apr should be reduced  prohibit issuance of a credit card to a consumer under the age of unless there is a co signer over the age of who has a means to repay or the individual under the age of has an independent means to repay  and require new billing statement disclosures  such as the length of time and cost of paying down the account balances if only minimum payments are made 
a number of the card act s requirements reflect our existing practices and will not require modifications of policies or procedures 
restrictions on risk management practices that have been commonplace in the industry already have compelled us  and our competitors  to manage risk through more restrictive underwriting and credit line management  reduce promotional offers and increase annual percentage rates 
certain provisions of the card act  however  such as those addressing limitations on interest rate increases  late and over limit fees and payment allocation  are requiring us to make additional fundamental changes to our current business practices and systems 
for example  we have informed our credit card customers that as of certain specified dates we will no longer charge over limit fees  impose fees for payments made over the telephone  or change interest rates on existing balances when a customer s payments are late 
full implementation of the card act requires the promulgation of regulations by the federal reserve 
the federal reserve has issued final regulations implementing the majority of the provisions of the card act 
we are making changes that the card act requires to be implemented in a relatively short timeframe 
other changes must await final regulatory guidance from the federal reserve 
we are continuing to evaluate appropriate modifications to products  revenue generation  marketing strategies and other business practices that will be in compliance with the law  will be attractive to consumers and will provide a good return for our stockholders 
the full impact of the card act on us is unknown at this time as it ultimately depends upon federal reserve interpretation of some of the provisions  successful implementation of our strategies  consumer behavior  and the actions of our competitors 
the card act also requires the federal reserve and the government accountability office to conduct various studies  including studies regarding interchange fees  reasons for credit limit reductions and rate increases  small business cards  and credit card terms and disclosures 
based on the results of these studies  new requirements that negatively impact us may be introduced as future legislation or regulation 
other credit card and student loan legislation congress may also consider other legislation affecting our business 
examples include a ceiling on the rate of interest that can be charged on credit cards  restrictions on interchange fees and merchant rules established by the credit card networks  authority for merchants to provide discounts to customers who use certain types of credit or debit cards  and extending the provisions of the card act to business cards 
we currently offer both federal and private student loans 
in september  the us house of representatives passed the student aid and fiscal responsibility act safra  which is currently under consideration in the us senate 
if passed in its current form  safra would require all federal student loans to be made directly by the federal government starting july  rather than by private institutions through the federal family education loan program 
because safra allows financial institutions to continue offering private student loans  we do not expect safra to have an impact on our ability to continue offering private student loans  even if we discontinue offering student loans under federal programs 

table of contents bankruptcy legislation the senate judiciary committee continues to consider legislation that would disallow claims in chapter bankruptcy based on high cost consumer debt and exclude consumers with such debt from the bankruptcy means test 
the means test requires debtors who can afford to repay a portion of their debts through chapter repayment plan do so  rather than discharge all indebtedness under chapter the proposed legislation  if enacted  could increase the percentage of bankruptcy filers who obtain full debt discharges to the detriment of all unsecured lenders  and could result in increased charge offs of our loan receivables 
it is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted by congress 
congress also continues to consider legislation to allow bankruptcy courts to restructure first mortgage loans eg  by reducing the loan amount to the value of the collateral  a process referred to as cramdown 
this change is likely to increase the number of individuals who file for bankruptcy  which would adversely impact all creditors including us 
while the house of representatives has approved a cramdown bill  it has garnered significant opposition in the senate and prospects for enactment are unclear 
financial regulatory reform reacting to the financial crisis and proposals from the administration  congress is considering extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms 
in december  the house of representatives approved the wall street reform and consumer protection act 
the senate banking committee plans to consider its own version of financial regulatory reform legislation in february 
the bills  though different at present  address risks to the economy and the payments system  especially those posed by large systemically significant financial firms  through a variety of measures  including regulatory oversight of nonbanking entities  increased capital requirements  enhanced authority to limit activities and growth  changes in supervisory authority  resolution authority for failed financial firms and the establishment of a fund to pay for the costs financed by assessments on financial firms with more than billion in assets  enhanced regulation of derivatives and asset backed securities eg  requiring loan originators to retain at least of the credit risk of securitized exposures  restrictions on executive compensation  and oversight of credit rating agencies 
both bills contain versions of a new independent consumer financial protection agency cfpa that would regulate consumer financial services and products  including credit  savings and payment products to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive practices  promote product simplicity and ensure equal access to financial products 
the cfpa would have sole rulemaking and interpretive authority under existing and future consumer financial services laws and supervisory  examination and enforcement authority over institutions subject to its regulations 
the bills would limit the ability of federal laws to preempt state and local law 
the president has made the enactment of financial reform legislation a priority  although there is significant opposition to several components  including the creation of a cfpa 
passage of the bills in their present form would have a material adverse impact on us  but prospects for approval of the legislation  and the content of a final bill  are unclear 
additionally  in january  the administration announced plans to propose a financial crisis responsibility fee over a ten year period on large financial firms to offset the cost of the us treasury s troubled asset relief program 
as currently outlined  we would be subject to the fee because the size of our balance sheet will exceed the billion threshold established by the proposal after the adoption of newly applicable accounting guidance related to consolidation 
as proposed  qualifying institutions would pay basis points on total assets less tier capital and deposits  beginning june  whether the fee will be implemented  and in what form  is uncertain 
compensation developments in june  the us treasury issued interim final rules implementing the compensation and corporate governance requirements under the american recovery and reinvestment act of  which amended the requirements of the emergency economic stabilization act of  as amended eesa  as described in our quarterly report for the quarter ended february  the rules apply to us as of june as a recipient of funds under the us treasury s capital purchase program 
these rules were subject to a public comment period which has expired  but no final rule has been adopted 
the rules  among other things  set forth prohibitions on incentive compensation payments  provide guidance on the use of restricted stock units  expand restrictions on golden parachute payments  mandate enforcement of clawback provisions unless unreasonable to do so  outline the steps compensation committees must take when evaluating risks posed by 
table of contents compensation arrangements  require the adoption and disclosure of a luxury expenditure policy  and require compliance with federal securities rules and regulations allowing stockholders to have a non binding advisory vote on executive compensation 
under rules issued by the sec pursuant to eesa  we  as a participant in the capital purchase program  will be required to include a non binding  advisory shareholder vote on the compensation of our executives  as set forth in the compensation discussion and analysis  the compensation tables  and any related material in our proxy statement  at our annual meeting in april 
additionally  new requirements under the us treasury s rules include enhanced disclosure of perquisites and the use of compensation consultants  and a prohibition on tax gross up payments 
in october  the federal reserve issued proposed supervisory guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation practices of banking organizations are consistent with safety and soundness 
the proposed guidance was subject to a public comment period which has expired  but no final guidance has been issued 
the federal reserve has also commenced a special horizontal review of compensation practices at large complex banking organizations  including us 
the financial regulatory reform bill approved by the house of representatives in december  which is described above  would impose additional disclosures and restrictions on compensation paid by financial institutions if enacted 
the bill also would require the regulation of inappropriate or imprudently risky compensation practices 
fdic rule regarding securitizations while we have capacity to issue new asset backed securities from our securitization trusts  there has been uncertainty in the securitization market recently as a result of revised accounting standards and related guidance from the fdic 
the ability of issuers of asset backed securities to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has been based  in part  on the fdic s rule entitled treatment by the federal deposit insurance corporation as conservator or receiver of financial assets transferred by an insured depository institution in connection with a securitization or participation  which provides that the fdic will not seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization  or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution  provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under gaap 
pursuant to fasb guidance for transfers of financial assets  effective for us on december   certain transfers of assets to special purpose entities including discover bank s transfer of assets to the discover card master trust no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment 
consequently  there has been uncertainty in the securitization market as to how the fdic will treat assets transferred into securitization vehicles under the new fasb guidance 
this uncertainty had made it difficult or impossible to obtain the necessary credit ratings for the issuances of asset backed securities  including the required ratings for securities to qualify as eligible securities under talf 
in november  the fdic issued an interim final rule that preserves the legal isolation treatment applicable under the existing fdic rule for asset backed securities issued on or prior to march   which is the date that talf expires 
issuances after this date are subject to the final determination of the fdic regarding the legal isolation standard  the potential framework of which was described in the fdic s advance notice of proposed rulemaking in december the form that this rule will ultimately take is uncertain at this time  but it may impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future 
fdic rule regarding assessments market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
as a result  we may be required to pay significantly increased premiums or additional special assessments 
in  we paid million for a special industry wide fdic deposit insurance assessment 
the fdic has finalized a proposal that requires banks to prepay their fdic insurance premiums for the years through on december   we prepaid million  which includes all of our quarterly assessments  typically paid one quarter in arrears  for the calendar quarters ending december  through december  additionally  in january  the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on ways that the fdic s risk based deposit insurance assessment system could be changed to account for the risks posed by certain employee compensation programs 
the remaining discussion provides a summary of our results of operations for the years ended november   and  as well as our financial condition at november  and all information and comparisons are based solely on continuing operations

the segment discussions that follow for the years ended november   and are on a managed basis 
direct banking our direct banking segment  formerly referred to as our us card segment  reported pretax income of billion for the year ended november   up from the year ended november  the increase was driven principally by income related to the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement  higher net interest income and lower operating expenses  partially offset by higher provision for loan losses 
net interest income increased million  or  due to the impact of higher interest rates on standard balances  a substantial reduction in promotional rate balances and lower interest rates on borrowings  partially offset by higher interest charge offs 
provision for loan losses increased billion  or  as a result of higher charge offs and a higher reserve rate  reflective of the current economic environment 
other income increased billion mainly due to revenue related to the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement 
other expense decreased million  or  reflecting the impact of cost containment initiatives such as a reduction of headcount  lower marketing and lower litigation expenses 
the other expenses included a million benefit due to curtailment of the company s pension plan 
managed loans of billion at november  were relatively unchanged from november  as lower payments from our credit card customers and growth in both student and personal loans were largely offset by lower balance transfer activity and sales volume 
rising unemployment and bankruptcy levels adversely impacted customer delinquencies and charge offs  resulting in a managed over days delinquency rate for the segment  including non credit card loans  up from at november  for the year ended november   the managed segment and credit card net charge off rates were and  respectively  up basis points and basis points  respectively  from the year ended november  our direct banking segment reported pretax income of billion for the year ended november   up million  or  as compared to november  the increase in pretax income was driven principally by payment from mastercard for its portion of the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement and by higher net interest income  partially offset by higher provision for loan losses 
net interest income increased million  or  as higher average loan receivables and the accretion of balance transfer fees  previously recorded in loan fee income  
table of contents resulted in higher interest income 
net interest income also benefited from lower interest expense driven by a lower cost of funds  which was partially offset by higher borrowings to fund higher loan receivables  higher interest charge offs and lower investment income 
provision for loan losses increased billion  or  as a result of higher net charge offs and a higher reserve rate  each of which reflected the deterioration in economic conditions and delinquency trends  as well as owned loan growth due to maturing securitizations 
other income increased million  or  due to the payment from mastercard for its portion of the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement and an increase in discount and interchange revenue 
these were partially offset by a million write down of the interest only strip receivable and the inclusion of balance transfer fees in interest income beginning in the third quarter of other expenses decreased million  or  primarily due to a million benefit from our pension curtailment  a lower level of marketing for new account acquisition and promotional activity  and a decrease in costs related to litigation 
the managed loan balance of billion at november  was up from november  this increase in loans was attributable to lower customer payments  growth in personal and student loans during the year and a slight increase in credit card volume  up in  largely due to higher gasoline prices 
this increase was partially offset by lower balance transfer activity in the weakening economic environment adversely impacted customer delinquencies and charge offs 
the managed over days delinquency rate for the segment  including non credit card loans  was at november   basis points higher than the comparable prior year 
for the year ended november   the managed segment and credit card charge off rates were and  up and basis points from the comparable prior year periods  respectively 
our loan growth combined with the deterioration in the credit environment led to a million increase to our reserves over and above our net charge offs for the year ended november  payment services revenues  expenses  pretax income and transaction volumes in our payment services segment  formerly referred to as our third party payments segment  grew significantly in from volumes benefited from the inclusion of diners club transaction volume for the full year in addition to higher activity from new and existing financial institutions on the pulse network 
these were partially offset by the loss of volume from one large financial institution along with lower third party issuer volume as a result of lower gasoline prices and lower overall spending 
our payment services segment reported pretax income of million for the year ended november   up million as compared to the year ended november  revenues were up million mainly driven by increased transactions on the pulse network  along with lower incentive payments and higher fee revenue 
expenses were also up million including a higher level of international marketing investments  partially offset by the impact of cost containment initiatives 
additionally  the increase in both revenues and expenses during is due to the inclusion of diners club for the full year 
our payment services segment reported pretax income of million for the year ended november   up million as compared to the year ended november  revenue increased as a result of a record billion in segment transaction volume  up from  and higher fee revenues 
additionally  in  diners club contributed billion of transaction volume  million of revenues and million of pretax income 
gaap to managed data reconciliations our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis 
securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our gaap statements of financial condition 
instances in which a wholly owned subsidiary of discover bank acquires certificated beneficial interests in securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the acquired beneficial interest and a corresponding increase in investment securities 
the portions of interest income  provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our gaap statements of income  however  they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions 
the managed basis presentation generally reverses the effects of securitization transactions  however  there are certain assets that arise from securitization transactions that are not reversed 
specifically  these assets are the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to the investors in certain transactions and payments made by our credit card 
table of contents customers which are allocated to the securitized loans  both of which are held at the trusts 
these assets also include the interest only strip receivable  which reflects the estimated fair value of the excess cash flows allocated to securitized loans and retained certificated beneficial interests 
income derived from these assets representing interest earned on accounts at the trusts  changes in the fair value of the interest only strip receivable  and interest income on investment securities also are not reversed in a managed presentation 
managed loan data is relevant because we service the securitized and owned loans  and the related accounts  in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans 
management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitizations 
loan receivables on a gaap or owned basis and related performance measures  including yield  charge offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis 
generally  loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned  while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts 
the seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship 
in comparison to more seasoned accounts  loan receivables of newer accounts typically have lower charge offs and delinquencies and carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new credit card customers  though such offers have been substantially reduced in recent periods 

table of contents financial measures using managed data are non gaap financial measures 
beginning with earnings summary  the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition is on a gaap basis 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the loan receivables and related statistics that are impacted by asset securitization  and which are shown on a managed basis in this annual report  to the most directly comparable gaap basis financial measure reconciliation of gaap to managed data for the years ended november  dollars in thousands loan receivables total loans gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis average total loans gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis interest yield gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis net principal charge off rate gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis delinquency rate over days gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis delinquency rate over days gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis credit card loans gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis average credit card loans gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis interest yield gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis net principal charge off rate gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis delinquency rate over days gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis delinquency rate over days gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis 
table of contents critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain 
for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity  it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period 
for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions  significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain cases  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for loan losses  our interest only strip receivable  the valuation of certain certificated retained interests in discover card execution note trust dcent  the accrual of credit card customer rewards cost  the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable net loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management evaluates the allowance monthly for adequacy 
the allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan losses 
in estimating losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio  we use an approach that utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card receivables 
a migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in loan receivables 
in determining the proper level of the allowance for loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
if management used different assumptions in estimating probable losses  the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a change in management s estimate of probable net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the allowance for loan losses at november   with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses 
see note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements for further details about the allowance for loan losses 
accounting for asset securitization transactions we account for our securitization transactions in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  transfers of financial assets 
the gain on a securitization transaction depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of the transfer 
the interest only strip receivable represents the contractual right to receive interest and certain loan fee revenues less certain costs  including loan losses on securitized loans and the contractual rate of interest paid to third party investors in the securitization as well as a servicing fee from the trust over the life of the asset sold 
in the absence of observable market prices  the fair value of the interest only strip receivable is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows using management s best estimate of the key assumptions  including forecasted interest yield  loan losses and payment rates  the interest paid to investors and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
changes in the estimated fair value of the interest only strip receivable  as well as certain other retained interests  are recorded in securitization income 
if management used different assumptions in estimating the value of the interest only strip receivable  the impact could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a change in the excess spread assumption for all securitized loans could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the value of the interest only strip receivable as of november  however  as described in accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations  pursuant to new fasb guidance related to transfers of financial assets and consolidation  the securitized loans will be consolidated in the company s financial statements effective december   at which time the entire value of the interest only strip receivable will be derecognized 
see note credit card securitization activities to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the accounting for securitizations 

table of contents valuation of certificated retained interests in dcent classified as available for sale investment securities certain of the subordinated beneficial interests we retain in our securitized assets  including class b and class c notes issued by dcent  are classified as available for sale investment securities and are carried on our consolidated statement of financial condition at their estimated fair values 
changes in the fair values of these notes are recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing discounted cash flow models  where the interest and principal payments are discounted at assumed current market rates for the same or comparable transactions 
in performing these valuations  management makes certain assumptions about the credit spreads and liquidity risk premiums that market participants would demand on the same or similar investments given the current market for credit card asset backed securities 
if management used different assumptions in calculating the weighted average discount rate  the change could have a significant impact on our statement of financial condition and equity 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate could have resulted in a million change in the value of the class b and class c notes classified as available for sale investment securities as of november  however  as described in accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations  pursuant to new fasb guidance related to transfers of financial assets and consolidation  our securitized loans will be consolidated in the company s financial statements effective december   at which time our certificated retained interests in dcent will be eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
see note investment securities  note credit card securitization activities and note fair value disclosures to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the accounting for our certificated retained interests in dcent 
customer rewards cost we offer our customers various reward programs  including the cashback bonus reward program  pursuant to which we offer certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer s purchases 
the liability for customer rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we compute our rewards liability on an individual customer basis and it is accumulated as qualified customers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity 
the liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical account closure and charge off experience  actual customer purchase activity and the terms of the rewards programs 
we recognize reward costs for both owned loans and securitized loans as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
if management used a different estimate of forfeitures  our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed significantly 
for example  a basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of november   could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately million 
the corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue 
see other income and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about credit card rewards cost 
goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets we recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the fair values of the acquired net assets 
in addition  we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the diners club business 
as required by gaap  we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  management must estimate the fair value of the business unit s to which the goodwill relates 
because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable  other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses 
similarly  in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment  management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models 
in applying these techniques  management considers historical results  business forecasts  market and industry conditions and other factors 
we may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques 
the valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance  revenue and expense growth  discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature 
if the assumptions used by management in these valuations are inappropriate  we may be exposed to an impairment loss that  when realized  could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations  primarily the united states  its states and municipalities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and tax reserves are established as appropriate 
changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes  interpretations of tax laws  the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities  and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken 
when such changes occur  the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant

earnings summary the following table outlines changes in our consolidated statement of income for the periods presented dollars in thousands for the years ended november  vs 
increase decrease vs 
increase decrease interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses other income other expense income from continuing operations before income tax expense income tax expense income from continuing operations net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets which we own and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets 
net interest margin represents interest income  net of interest expense  as a percentage of total interest earning assets on an annualized basis 
our interest earning assets consist of i loan receivables  ii our liquidity reserve which includes amounts on deposit with the federal reserve  highly rated certificates of deposit  and triple a rated government mutual funds  iii certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization  and iv investment securities 
interest earning assets do not include investors interests in securitization transactions that have been transferred to third parties 
similarly  interest income does not include the interest yield on the related loans 
our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits  both brokered and direct to consumer 
net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of interest earning assets and liabilities  including the percentage of floating rate credit card loan receivables we own and the percentage of floating rate liabilities we owe  changes in the interest rate environment  including the levels of interest rates and the relationship between interest rate indices  such as the prime rate and federal funds rate  credit performance of our loans  particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges which reduce interest income  and the terms of certificates of deposit upon initial offering  including maturity and interest rate 

table of contents for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  for the year ended november   net interest income grew million  or  compared to the year ended november  during the same periods  our net interest margin and interest rate spread increased to and  respectively  up from and  respectively 
a higher average level of on balance sheet loans was the largest factor driving the increased net interest income  which  along with other factors  is discussed below 
the higher average level of on balance sheet loans at november  compared to november   was due to retaining more loan receivables on balance sheet throughout as securitized receivables matured  however  our ending loan receivable balance declined from to as we had securitization transactions in the later half of resulting in a lower level of on balance sheet loan receivables at year end 
interest income on credit card loans grew million from the year ended november  as a result of retaining more loan receivables on balance sheet as securitized receivables matured  as well as an increase in the interest yield of basis points 
the increase in yield was the result of higher interest rates on standard balances and a substantial reduction in promotional rate balances 
this was partially offset by higher interest charge offs due to the deterioration in the current economic environment as well as a higher average level of on balance sheet loans 
interest income on other consumer loans increased million from reflecting growth in both personal and student loans partially offset by a basis point decrease in interest yield 
the yield decreased as the proportion of student loans  which bear lower interest rates than personal loans  as a component of total other consumer loans increased 
interest income on cash and cash equivalents and other assets decreased million from reflecting the unfavorable impact of the lower interest rate environment on our liquidity reserve and amounts due from asset securitization 
the changes in interest expense had a minimal impact on net interest income as lower cost of funds was largely offset by a higher level of deposit funding 
beginning in the second half of  we increased our deposit issuance in order to fund more loan receivables on balance sheet as a result of securitization maturities 
since that time  benchmark interest rates have declined  also driving down deposit rates 
these lower deposit rates contributed to a basis point decline in the cost of deposit funding in compared to for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  for the year ended november   net interest income grew million  or  compared to the year ended november  during the same periods  our net interest margin and interest rate spread decreased to and  respectively  down from and  respectively 
interest income on credit card loans grew million from the year ended november   as a result of retaining more loan receivables on balance sheet as securitized receivables matured  in addition to a basis point increase in interest yield 
this increase in yield was driven by the inclusion of million of balance transfer fees in interest income beginning in the third quarter of this was partially offset by rising interest charge offs due to the deterioration in the economic environment as well as a higher level of on balance sheet loans 
interest income on other consumer loans increased million from the year ended november  reflecting growth in both personal and student loans  in addition to a basis point increase in interest yield 
the yield increased due to higher rates on newly issued personal loans 
interest income on cash and cash equivalents and other assets decreased million from the year ended november   reflecting the unfavorable impact of the lower interest rate environment on our liquidity reserve and amounts due from asset securitization 
interest expense increased million  or  largely due to our higher average funding levels in  partially offset by a basis point decrease to in our cost of funds for the year ended november  as a result of the lower interest rate environment  and the repayment of short term borrowings due to our former parent company prior to our spin off

table of contents provision and allowance for loan losses provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date 
factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer  including unemployment levels  bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  changes in our loan portfolio  including the overall mix of accounts  products and loan balances within the portfolio  the level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge offs  the credit quality of the loan portfolio  which reflects  among other factors  our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts  and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance 
in calculating the allowance for loan losses  we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics 
for our credit card loans  we use a migration analysis to determine the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through various stages of delinquency to charge off 
an estimated charge off ratio is then applied to each delinquency category to derive an estimated reserve rate 
to determine if any adjustments should be made to the reserve rate derived from the migration analysis  we consider current economic trends as well as the difference between actual charge offs and what was estimated to be charged off in recent periods 
for our other consumer loans  we consider historical and forecasted losses in estimating the related allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended november   the provision for loan losses increased million  or  compared to the year ended november   reflecting higher net charge offs and an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses 
higher net charge offs are a result of the deterioration in the current economic environment  and are discussed further in net charge offs and delinquencies below 
at november   the allowance for loan losses was billion  an increase of million from november  this increase reflects a reserve addition related to a basis point increase to the reserve rate  partially offset by a billion decline in on balance sheet loans at november  for the year ended november   the provision for loan losses increased million  or  compared to the year ended november   reflecting an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses and higher net charge offs 
in the year ended november   we added million to the allowance for loan losses to bring the total allowance to billion  an increase of over november  this increase in the allowance reflects an increase in the loan loss reserve rate due to rising delinquency and charge off rates and loan growth  particularly in the fourth quarter of as we retained more loan receivables from maturing securitizations on our balance sheet in response to the inability to re securitize the receivables as a result of the disruption in the securitization markets at that time

charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense 
credit card loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days contractually past due  except in the case of customer bankruptcies and probate accounts 
customer bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the day contractual time frame 
the net charge off rate is calculated by dividing net charge offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period 
the following table presents amounts and rates of net charge offs of loan receivables dollars in thousands for the years ended november  credit card loans other consumer loans total net charge offs 
table of contents the net charge off rate on our loan receivables increased basis points and basis points for the years ended november  and  respectively  compared to november  and the net charge off rate has steadily increased since the fourth quarter of  reflecting the weakening economic environment as a result of rising unemployment  an increase in bankruptcy related charge offs and the decrease in the availability of consumer credit 
additionally  personal loans  which are included in other consumer loans  grew significantly in and into  have seasoned and have started to experience charge offs 
delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time 
loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due 
loan receivables are placed on non accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a customer  suspected fraudulent activity on an account  as part of certain collection management processes  and other instances in which management feels collectability is not assured 
in some cases of suspected fraudulent activity  loan receivables may resume accruing interest upon completion of the fraud investigation 
the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over days past due  loan receivables over days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest  regardless of delinquency dollars in thousands at november  loans over days delinquent loans over days delinquent and accruing interest loans not accruing interest the delinquency rates of loans over days delinquent and loans over days delinquent and accruing interest increased basis points and basis points  respectively at november   as compared to november the increase in both measures reflected the impact of the weaker economic environment on our customers ability to pay their loan balances 
delinquency rates normally rise as charge offs rise  however  since the third quarter  we have been experiencing a pattern of charge offs rising faster than delinquencies 
this pattern is the result of having a higher proportion of balances move from delinquent status to charge off than in historical periods 
the movement from delinquent status to charge off has increased as more customers are unable to become current on their past due accounts and as more customers declare bankruptcy 
loan receivables not accruing interest at november  increased basis points to  as compared to november   as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications 
the delinquency rates of loans over days delinquent and loans over days delinquent and accruing interest increased basis points and basis points  respectively  at november   as compared to november  this increase in both measures reflected of the weaker economic environment on our customers ability to pay their loan balances 
loan receivables not accruing interest at november  increased basis points to  as compared to november   as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications 

table of contents maturities and sensitivities of loan receivables to changes in interest rates our loan receivables had the following maturity distribution at november  dollars in thousands due one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years total credit card loans other consumer loans total loan receivables because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns  the above amounts have been calculated using contractually required minimum payments 
historically  actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments  and therefore  the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments 
at november   approximately billion of our loan receivables due after one year had interest rates tied to an index and approximately billion were fixed rate loans 
other income the principal component of other income is securitization income 
the following table presents the components of other income for the periods presented dollars in thousands for the years ended november  vs

other income total other income net of rewards  including cashback bonus rewards  of million  million and million for the years ended november   and  respectively 
total other income increased million  or  for the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november   primarily as a result of billion of higher income related to the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement  partially offset by lower securitization income 
for the year ended november   total other income increased million  or  as compared to november   primarily as a result of an million payment from mastercard for its portion of the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement and higher securitization income  partially offset by a decline in loan fee income 
these key drivers as well as other factors are discussed in more detail below 
securitization income through november   the issuance of asset backed securities to investors  referred to as securitization  has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from our consolidated statements of financial condition 
securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through the securitization and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card loan receivables we originate 
also  portions of net interest income  provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income  however  they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our residual interests in those transactions 
we allocate the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue and  in recent years  merchant discount and interchange revenue earned on securitized loans see 
table of contents further discussion of merchant discount and interchange revenue below to investors in securitizations 
these cash flows are used to pay investors in the transactions a contractual rate of return on their investment  to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans  net of recoveries  and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans 
any excess cash flows  referred to as excess spread  are paid to us 
both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income 
securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable and certain other retained interests  reflecting adjustments to the fair values that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests 
beginning december   our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income  but will instead report interest income  net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt 
additionally  we will no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans will no longer receive sale accounting treatment  nor will there be any gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing and  accordingly  will be derecognized on december  for more information  see accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations

securitization income is significantly influenced by the level of average securitized loans 
average securitized loans of billion for the year ended november   was significantly lower than the billion and billion average levels of securitized loans at november  and  respectively  as a result of the disruption in the credit card asset backed securitization markets beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into for the year ended november   securitization income decreased million  or  as compared to the year ended november  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower excess spread on securitized loans along with lower servicing fees earned and a decrease in the net revaluation of retained interests 
in  securitization income increased million  or  as compared to primarily reflecting higher excess spread on securitized loans offset in part by a decrease in the net revaluation of retained interests

the higher net charge offs were reflective of the weakening economic and credit environment 
servicing fees on securitized loans 
servicing fees are paid to the company for servicing the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements and are largely dependent on the level of securitized loans

we offer our customers various reward programs  including the cashback bonus reward program  pursuant to which we pay certain customers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer s purchases 
reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue 
discount and interchange revenue increased million  or  for the year ended november   compared to november   due to lower customer rewards costs  partially offset by lower revenues earned on a lower level of owned loans

merchant fees to broaden merchant acceptance of discover network cards  we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late in addition  we have sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and to reduce costs 
as we move away from direct merchant relationships  our merchant fee income and related costs will decline 
the lower cost per transaction is generally expected to be offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance

merchant fees consist primarily of fees charged to merchants for various services including manual authorization of transactions and delivery of hardcopy statements 
for the years ended november  and  merchant fees decreased million  or  and million  or  as compared to the years november  and  respectively

in addition  we seek to achieve an appropriate maturity profile  to utilize a cost effective mix of both long term and short term funding sources and to ensure the composition of our investor base provides appropriate diversification 
our primary funding sources include deposits  sourced directly or through brokers  term asset backed securitizations  asset backed conduit financing and long term borrowings 
during  we raised approximately billion through new issuances and renewals of existing deposits  the majority of which were sourced through our direct to consumer deposit channel 
we also successfully completed several capital market transactions including billion of asset backed securitizations that were eligible for funding through the talf program and asset backed conduit financing  an offering of million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes  an offering of million in principal amount of subordinated notes of discover bank and a common stock offering resulting in approximately million in net proceeds to us

securitization financing 
historically  we have used the securitization of credit card receivables as one of our largest sources of funding  including both the public securitization market and the privately placed asset backed conduit financing market 
for much of and  market events and capital market disruptions had made the securitization market unavailable at volumes and pricing that would be attractive to us 
in november  the federal reserve announced the launch of the term asset backed securities loan facility  or talf  in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities by offering financing on relatively favorable terms 
the talf program currently extends through march  dcent issued its first talf eligible transaction on july  for billion with a three year term 
dcent issued a second talf eligible transaction on september  for billion with a three year term 
we have capacity to issue up to billion in triple a rated asset backed securities from our securitization trusts  the same amount of which is available for issuance on or before march  through the talf program 
the triple a rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based  in part  on an fdic rule which provides that the fdic will not seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization  or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution  provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under gaap 
pursuant to fasb guidance related to transfers of financial assets and consolidations  effective december   the transfer of assets made to the discover card master trust i dcmt and dcent will no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment 
consequently  there has been uncertainty in the securitization market as to how the fdic will treat assets transferred into securitization vehicles under the newly effective fasb guidance 
on november   the fdic issued an interim final rule which preserves the legal isolation treatment applicable under the existing fdic rule for asset backed securities issued on or before march  the fdic interim rule has lifted the uncertainty of existing securitizations and both talf and non talf issuance on or before march  however  issuances beyond march  are subject to the final determination by the fdic of the legal isolation standard 
on december   the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking  which describes a possible framework for legal isolation treatment of asset backed securities issued after march  the form that this rule will ultimately take is uncertain at this time  but it may impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future 
at november   we had billion of outstanding public asset backed securities  billion of outstanding private asset backed conduit financings and billion of outstanding asset backed securities that had been issued to subsidiaries of the company 
at november   we had billion in unused asset backed conduit capacity 

table of contents the following table summarizes expected maturities of the investors interests in securitizations excluding those that have been issued to subsidiaries of the company at november  dollars in thousands total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of the investors interests in securitizations issued to third parties we access the public asset backed securitization market through dcmt and dcent  using receivables generated by our credit card business 
through dcmt we have used a structure utilizing class a and class b certificates held by third parties  with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated class b certificates  a cash collateral account and a more subordinated series ce certificate described below 
dcent consists of four classes of securities class a  b  c and d  with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated classes of notes 
as of november   billion of class b and c notes are owned by subsidiaries of discover bank 
we have completed the following transactions for dcmt and dcent since mid in the third quarter of  we issued the discoverseries class d note from dcent that added credit enhancement to all outstanding notes of the discoverseries and is available to support new issuances of discoverseries notes through increases in the stated principal amount 
on november   the stated principal amount of the class d notes was million  which was approximately of the then outstanding notes of dcent including the class d notes 
in january  we increased the size of the class d note to further support the more senior dcent securities 
a wholly owned subsidiary of discover bank owns the dcent class d note 
in the third quarter of  we issued series ce from dcmt to provide credit enhancement to dcmt investor certificates 
this subordinate series supports all outstanding series of dcmt other than series cc which supports the dcent notes  for which the discoverseries class d notes were issued 
on november   the stated principal amount of this subordinate series was million  which is generally equivalent to of the series investor interests  including the subordinate series 
dcmt series  which had lower initial levels of credit enhancement  received additional credit enhancement through the subordinate series in an amount bringing its enhancement levels in line with other comparable series of dcmt certificates 
in january  we increased the size of series ce to further support the more senior dcmt certificates 
the dcmt series ce investor certificates are owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of discover bank 
in addition  in september we issued series sd from dcmt to enhance excess spread for all outstanding series of investor certificates and tranches of discoverseries notes 
series sd makes all of its principal collections available for reallocation on an as needed basis to all outstanding series including the discoverseries to cover shortfalls in interest and servicing fees and to reimburse charge offs for those other series 
the availability of these principal collections increases excess spread levels for dcmt and for the discoverseries notes 
the series sd interest will remain equal to approximately of the total investors interests 
the dcmt series sd investor certificates are owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of discover bank 
the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier than expected repayment of the underlying securities  accelerating the need for alternative funding 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements  the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities 
we refer to this as economic early amortization  which is based on excess spread levels 
excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period  including interest collections  fees and interchange  as well as the amount of certain principal collections available to be reallocated from series sd  exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period  including interest expense  servicing fees and charged off receivables 
in the event of an economic early amortization  which would occur if the excess spread falls below for a contractually specified period  generally a three month rolling average  we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings over a period of a few months 
as of november   no economic early amortization events have occurred

discount series dcmt sd  which was issued in september  makes principal collections available for reallocation to other series to cover shortfalls in interest and servicing fees and to reimburse charge offs 
three month rolling average excess spread rates reflected the benefit of these additional collections 
as of november   the balance of cash collateral account loans supporting dcmt  which we had funded  was million and is recorded in amounts due from asset securitization in our consolidated statement of financial condition at its fair value of million 
a majority of this funding was obtained through a loan facility entered into between a consolidated special purpose subsidiary  drfc funding llc  and third party lenders 
at november   million of the drfc funding llc loan facility remains outstanding and is recorded in long term borrowings in our consolidated statement of financial condition 
repayment of this loan facility is secured by million of cash collateral account loans at november  this portion of the cash collateral account loans was sold to drfc funding llc and is not expected to be available to creditors of discover financial services

this facility is provided by a group of major global banks  and is available to both discover financial services and discover bank discover financial services may borrow up to and discover bank may borrow up to of the total commitment 
we anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short term funding needs from time to time 
we have no outstanding balances due under the facility 
federal reserve 
discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s discount window 
as of november   discover bank had billion of available capacity through the discount window  which includes billion capacity through the term auction facility 
our federal reserve available capacity decreased in the fourth quarter of due to the federal reserve decreasing the amount it will lend against certain loans pledged as collateral 
ecasla

ecasla provides originators of federal family education loan program ffelp loans with the ability to transfer qualifying ffelp loans to the department of education through participation and loan sale programs and or finance ffelp loans through an asset backed conduit program 
ecasla provides us with a potential source of funding and liquidity with respect to qualifying ffelp loans originated by discover bank 
credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets  including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt  may be affected by the credit ratings for discover financial services  discover bank and the securitization trusts 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

we expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business activities in the short term and long term through normal access to our funding sources  relying primarily on deposit issuance 
in the assessment of our liquidity needs  we also evaluate a range of stress events that would impact our access to normal funding sources  cash needs and or liquidity 
we maintain contingent funding sources  including our liquidity reserve  remaining asset backed conduit capacity  committed credit facility capacity and federal reserve discount window capacity  that we could utilize to satisfy liquidity needs during such stress events 
in the event that access to capital markets  including the securitization market  is unavailable during the next twelve months  we believe that we would be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations during that time by utilizing our deposit channels and our contingent funding sources 

table of contents our liquidity reserve is comprised of cash and cash equivalents and other investments 
cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in deposits with the federal reserve  highly rated certificates of deposit  and triple a rated government mutual funds with maturities of days or less when purchased 
other investments include certificates of deposit with maturities greater than days and certain credit card asset backed securities of other issuers 
the level of our liquidity reserve may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions

capital we seek to manage capital to levels and composition sufficient to support the risks of the business  meet regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines  and support future business growth 
our primary sources of capital are from the earnings generated by the business  proceeds from participating in a government program  and equity raised through the capital markets 
under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the fdic  the federal reserve and other bank regulatory agencies  we must maintain minimum levels of capital 
these requirements are more fully described in note capital adequacy to our consolidated financial statements 
at november   discover financial services and our primary banking subsidiary  discover bank  maintained a well capitalized status  exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject 
in the third quarter of  we took certain actions to adjust the credit enhancement structure of our securitization trusts as described in liquidity and capital resources funding sources securitization financing above 
these actions had the effect of including trust assets in our risk weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes effective july as a result  consolidation of the trusts under new accounting guidance effective on december   as described in accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations  will have a lesser impact on our regulatory capital calculations than would have otherwise been the case  because much of this effect has already been reflected as a result of the trust actions 
however  the billion charge to retained earnings as a result of adopting new accounting guidance will reduce our regulatory capital ratios as illustrated in accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations above 
nevertheless  both discover financial services and discover bank are expected to remain above well capitalized levels after the adoption of the new accounting guidance 
equity capital 
equity increased to billion at november  from billion at november  our capital level has been positively impacted by the closing of the billion cpp transaction with the us treasury in march described below 
in addition  in the third quarter  we completed a million common stock 
table of contents offering in which we issued approximately million shares 
our capital position in and has also been positively impacted by the visa and master card antitrust litigation settlement more fully described below 
going forward  as we continue to evaluate our capital levels  we will also evaluate our continued participation in the cpp and we intend  at the appropriate time  subject to the approval of the federal reserve  to repurchase our preferred stock from the us treasury 
us treasury capital purchase program 
on march   we issued and sold to the us treasury  shares of senior preferred stock and a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to anti dilution adjustments  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
the issuance is part of the us treasury s troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program cpp  under which the us treasury purchased senior preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy 
the senior preferred stock qualifies as tier capital and pays a cumulative dividend at the rate of five percent per annum for the first five years and at the rate of nine percent per annum beginning may  the senior preferred stock is generally non voting  other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock 
the terms of the senior preferred stock provide that the stock may not be redeemed  as opposed to repurchased  prior to may  unless we have received aggregate gross proceeds from one or more qualified equity offerings as described below of at least million 
in such a case  we may redeem the senior preferred stock  in whole or in part  subject to the approval of the federal reserve  upon notice  up to a maximum amount equal to the aggregate net cash proceeds received by us from such qualified equity offerings 
a qualified equity offering is a sale and issuance for cash by us  to persons other than us or our subsidiaries after march   of shares of perpetual preferred stock  common stock or a combination thereof  that in each case qualify as tier capital at the time of issuance under the applicable risk based capital guidelines of the federal reserve 
on or after may   the senior preferred stock may be redeemed by us at any time  in whole or in part  subject to the approval of the federal reserve and notice requirements 
however  pursuant to a letter agreement between us and the us treasury  we are permitted  after obtaining the approval of the federal reserve  to redeem the senior preferred stock at any time  and when such senior preferred stock is repaid  the us treasury is required to liquidate the warrant  all in accordance with the american recovery and reinvestment act of  as it may be amended from time to time arra  and any rules and regulations thereunder 
the us treasury may transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time 
participation in the cpp restricts our ability to increase dividends on our common stock above historical levels or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed  unless i all of the senior preferred stock issued to the us treasury is redeemed  ii all of the senior preferred stock issued to the us treasury has been transferred to third parties  or iii we receive the consent of the us treasury 
participation in the cpp subjects us to increased oversight by the us treasury and banking regulators 
the us treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulators 
in addition  the us treasury has the right to appoint two directors to our board if we miss dividend payments for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  on the preferred stock 
participation in the cpp also subjects us to increased congressional scrutiny 
in connection with participating in the cpp  we became a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of and a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley act 
registration as a bank holding company subjects us to new legal and regulatory requirements  including minimum capital requirements  and subjects us to oversight  regulation and examination by the federal reserve 
we are also subject to certain restrictions on executive compensation for our senior executive officers and the next most highly compensated employees under the emergency economic stabilization act of  as amended the eesa

dividends 
our board of directors declared a common stock cash dividend of 
per share in december  payable on january   to holders of record on december  the quarterly common stock dividend was reduced from 
per share to 
per share in the first quarter of in order to enhance our capital position 
this reduction to 
per share has strengthened our capital base by approximately million per quarter 
the declaration and payment of future dividends  as well as the amount thereof  are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  capital levels  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends in the future 
in addition  as a result of applicable banking law regulations and guidance and provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries  our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be further limited 
under the terms of our cpp transaction  we are prohibited from increasing dividends on our common stock above historical levels 
per share until march unless i all of the senior preferred stock issued to the us treasury is redeemed  ii all of the senior preferred stock issued to the us treasury has been transferred to third parties  or iii we receive the consent of the us treasury 
furthermore  so long as any of the preferred stock is outstanding  dividend payments on our common stock will be prohibited unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock 
also in  we accrued million of dividends on our senior preferred stock issued under the cpp  which represents a rate of per year 
special dividend and settlement of visa and mastercard antitrust litigation 
on october   we settled our antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard for billion 
we received a lump sum amount of billion from mastercard in the fourth quarter of and billion from visa in  which we recorded in other income in our direct banking segment  formerly referred to as our us card segment 
at the time of our spin off  we entered into an agreement with morgan stanley to give us sole control over the investigation  prosecution and resolution of the antitrust lawsuit with visa and mastercard and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared the special dividend agreement 
as a result  we have incurred an obligation to accrue amounts pursuant to the special dividend agreement with respect to settlement proceeds from visa and mastercard only to the extent that we have already earned and received such proceeds pursuant to the terms of the settlement with visa and mastercard as of the balance sheet date 
at november   we had accrued million in connection with the special dividend and million in related other expenses 
the special dividend agreement is a subject of litigation between morgan stanley and us

contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
contractual obligations at november  include deposits  long term borrowings  operating and capital lease obligations and purchase obligations 
our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of november  are summarized below dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years more than five years deposits long term borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases interest payments on fixed rate debt purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations see note long term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate notes is estimated to be million as of november   utilizing the current interest rates as of that date 
purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under  among other things  consulting  outsourcing  data  advertising  sponsorship  software license and telecommunications agreements 
purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants 
purchase obligations at november  reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable 
these amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition 
other long term liabilities include our expected future contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and our prepaid fdic special assessment 
as of november  our consolidated statement of financial condition reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  and approximately million of accrued interest and penalties

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets  principally managed loan receivables 
changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets  including asset backed securitizations  deposits  and short term and long term borrowings 
our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve our objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate 
we use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from our reporting date  we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously  simultaneously and to the same degree 
our interest rate sensitive assets include certain loan receivables  certain amounts due from asset securitizations  interest earning deposits and certain investment securities 
although we have moved the majority of our credit card loans to variable rates  some of our loans are still at fixed rates 
due to new credit card legislation  we have restrictions on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances 
assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are considered to be rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index  such as federal funds or libor  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  also are considered to be rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november   we estimate that the pretax income reported on a managed basis over the following month period would be increased by approximately million 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november   we estimated that the pretax income reported on a managed basis over the following month period would be decreased by approximately million 
at november   a majority of our credit card loan receivables have moved to variable rates  which will have a positive impact on pretax income in a rising interest rate scenario 
we have not provided an estimate of any impact on pretax income of a decrease in interest rates as many of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to interest rates that are already at or near their minimum levels and  therefore  could not materially decrease further
