to a large extent  continued engagement of our company by our customers for successive business opportunities depends upon the customers satisfaction with the quality of products and services we provide 
as such  it is difficult for us to predict with any high degree of certainty the number  size  and profitability of printing services that we expect to provide for more than a few weeks in advance

conversely  revenues tend to be seasonally weaker in the quarters ended june and september

paper cost is the most significant component of our materials cost  however  fluctuation in paper pricing generally does not materially impact our operating margins because we typically quote  and subsequently purchase  paper for each specific printing project we are awarded 
as a result  any changes in paper pricing are effectively passed through to customers by our printing businesses
