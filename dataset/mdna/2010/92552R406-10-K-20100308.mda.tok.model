the following financial highlights are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap viad corp consolidated total revenues of million  a decrease of percent from revenues net loss attributable to viad of million compared to net income attributable to viad of million in diluted loss per share of compared to income per share of in viad recorded aggregate impairment losses of million primarily related to the non cash write down of goodwill and other intangible assets at ges including melville and becker group as well as the write down of a non operating asset held for sale as of december  viad recorded restructuring charges totaling million primarily related to reorganization activities  including facility consolidations 
viad also recorded restructuring reversals of million primarily related to revisions in estimated sublease income associated with certain leased facilities income from discontinued operations of  primarily related to the reversal of certain liabilities associated with previously sold operations cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  debt was million as of december  marketing events group ges revenues of million  a decrease of percent from revenues segment operating income of million  as compared to million in experiential marketing services revenues of million  a decrease of percent from revenues segment operating loss of million compared to income in of million travel recreation group revenues of million  a decrease of percent from revenues segment operating income of million compared to million in non gaap measures the following discussion includes a presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses  which are utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income attributable to viad before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and 
table of contents amortization  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
income before impairment losses is defined by viad as income from continuing operations before the after tax effect of impairment losses related to goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
income before impairment losses is utilized by management to review operating results of the business without the effects of non cash impairment losses 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses primarily as performance measures and believes that the gaap financial measures most directly comparable to these non gaap measures are net income attributable to viad and income from continuing operations attributable to viad  respectively 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes  impairment losses or recoveries  and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
similarly  although income before impairment losses is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  its use is limited because it does not consider non cash goodwill  other intangible asset and other long lived asset impairment losses 
because adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses do not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to viad and income from continuing operations attributable to viad as important measures of financial performance because they provide more complete measures of the company s performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to viad is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda impairment recoveries losses interest expense income tax benefit expense depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations net income loss attributable to viad the decrease in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily driven by lower segment operating results at all operating segments  restructuring charges and lower interest income  partially offset by lower corporate activities expense 
the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily driven by favorable operating income at ges and exhibitgroup giltspur and lower corporate activities expense  partially offset by lower interest income 
a reconciliation of income loss before impairment losses attributable to viad to income loss from continuing operations attributable to viad is as follows in thousands income loss before impairment losses attributable to viad impairment recoveries losses  net of tax income loss from continuing operations attributable to viad includes income tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively  and income tax expense of  in see results of operations below for a discussion of goodwill  other intangible asset and other long lived asset impairment losses

revenues for decreased percent to million from billion in viad s loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million for compared to income of million for the loss from continuing operations attributable to viad was million  or per diluted share  compared to income of million  or per diluted share  in these declines were largely the result of impairment losses of million as well as recessionary declines in marketing spending and tourism  negative show rotation revenue of million  and a million decline in revenues due to unfavorable currency translation 
the impairment losses primarily related to goodwill and other intangible assets in viad s marketing events group  including million at ges including melville and million at becker group  as well as million related to the write down of a non operating asset held for sale as of december  impairment losses were million in  including million primarily related to goodwill and other intangible assets at becker group and million related to certain intangible assets associated with melville 
the loss attributable to viad before impairment losses was million  or per diluted share  compared to income before impairment losses of million  or per diluted share  in the net loss attributable to viad for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for these results include income of  or per diluted share  and  or per diluted share  respectively  from discontinued operations relating to obligations associated with previously sold operations 
marketing events group 
revenues for ges were million for  a decrease of percent from the amount of million 
ges segment operating income was million in  compared to million in these declines resulted primarily from a significant reduction in exhibition marketing spending as well as negative show rotation and unfavorable currency translation  which negatively impacted ges revenue by million and million  respectively  versus ges base same show revenues declined percent in management defines base same show revenue as revenue from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year 
base same shows represented approximately percent of ges revenue in revenues for viad s experiential marketing services segment were million in  down percent from million in experiential marketing services segment operating loss for was million compared to income of million in these declines resulted primarily from reduced exhibitor spending as well as lower sales of holiday themed events and experiences and retail merchandising units as shopping center clients reduced spending in response to the recession 
during  viad revised downward its forecast for future revenues and earnings in the marketing events group based on continued declines in exhibition marketing spending by its customers and a sharper than expected decline in retail holiday d cor demand 
as a result  the company projected a more prolonged contraction in its trade show and retail marketing revenues than was previously anticipated 
due to these facts and circumstances  viad performed an impairment evaluation of goodwill  other intangible assets and certain other long lived assets 
as a result of the evaluation  viad recorded aggregate goodwill impairment losses of million related to its marketing events group 
the aggregate goodwill impairment losses consisted of million at the ges reporting segment including melville and million at becker group  which is included in the experiential marketing services reporting segment 
in addition  the company recorded aggregate other intangible asset impairment losses of million 
of this total amount  million related to intangible assets at becker group and million related to ges primarily melville 
viad also recorded impairment losses of million related to touring exhibit assets at becker group 
during  viad recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million related to becker group  aggregate other intangible asset impairment losses of million related to becker group and melville and an impairment loss of million related to a touring exhibit asset at becker group 
although the marketing events group has a diversified revenue base  its revenues are affected by general economic and industry specific conditions 
the current recessionary environment is negatively impacting the exhibition and event industry  resulting in lower trade show attendance and exhibitor spending 
additionally  the pricing environment remains challenging 
although ges has long term contracts for future shows  the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
in anticipation of revenue pressures  management began taking actions to reduce overhead costs during early through continued efforts in this area  management realized a full year reduction in overhead costs of approximately million in the marketing events group as compared to  including approximately million at ges and approximately million in the 
table of contents experiential marketing services segment 
the marketing events group is also in the process of implementing changes to its service delivery processes in order to further increase efficiencies  decrease costs and enhance service levels 
management expects to realize additional cost reductions and revenue synergies as a result of the strategic reorganization announced in july  which included the alignment of ges and the experiential marketing services segment into one business unit  the marketing events group 
management is focused on leveraging the collective strengths of ges and the experiential marketing services segment to win market share by delivering comprehensive  innovative  value added solutions that enable clients to generate a higher return on their face to face marketing investments 
management is also focused on improving the sales pipeline and win rate to drive profitable revenue growth  as well as ongoing cost control  productivity enhancements and increased capacity utilization in order to improve profitability in future years 
to support the integration of these businesses  exhibitgroup giltspur and becker group were combined into the ges legal entity effective january   and the newly combined entity was re branded and renamed as global experience specialists on february  primarily as a result of the strategic reorganization  viad recorded restructuring charges of million during related to the marketing events group 
in addition  viad also reversed restructuring reserves of million primarily related to revisions in estimated sublease income associated with certain leased facilities 
management expects to record additional restructuring charges of approximately million in the first quarter of as a result of continued reorganization activities 
additional charges may be incurred as management continues to reduce its cost structure 
in  management expects same show revenues to decline by approximately percent and show rotation to positively impact revenues by approximately million due to a few major  non annual shows that will occur in management also expects continued weak demand from shopping center clients for holiday themed events and experiences and retail merchandising units 
additionally  management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances will not have a significant impact on results 
management remains focused on increasing productivity and controlling costs  including the implementation of cost reduction efforts 
ges and exhibitgroup giltspur are subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  about one third of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the companies and labor are currently stable  disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of ges and or exhibitgroup giltspur 
travel recreation group 
revenues of the travel recreation group segment were million in  a decrease of percent from million in segment operating income was million in compared to million in operating margins were percent in compared to percent in as discussed below  exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues and operating income in this segment by million and million  respectively  as compared to results in were also negatively affected by reduced tourism demand 
during  the travel recreation group commenced a plan of sale related to a non strategic real estate asset  which consists of land  building and related improvements  and which was expected to be sold within one year 
accordingly  the value of this asset was remeasured based on the estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
as a result of the remeasurement  the company recorded an impairment loss of million 
furthermore  the recorded value of this asset of million was reclassified and presented under the caption asset held for sale in viad s consolidated balance sheets as of december  viad completed the sale of this asset in the first quarter of during  approximately percent of revenue and percent of operating income generated by viad s travel recreation group segment was derived through its canadian operations 
these operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation  and accordingly  increases in the value of the canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes  and  therefore  revenue and operating income in the travel recreation group segment 
the operating results related to viad s canadian travel recreation group subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of and for and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s consolidated results of operations were impacted by the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar as it relates to the translation of its canadian operations 
future decreases in the exchange rates may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons when operating results are translated into us dollars 
the travel recreation group segment is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities 
as a result of global economic weakness  management expects results from the travel recreation group segment to remain under pressure in additionally  management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances will not have a significant impact on results

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding those obligations 
purchase obligations primarily represent payments due under various licensing agreements and commitments related to product licenses  consulting and other contracted services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
also included are multi year utility contracts for which the minimum requirements contained in the contracts are included in the table 
aggregate liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of million including interest and penalties are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows are highly uncertain 
viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions  proceedings and pending claims  some of which involve  or may involve  compensatory  punitive or other damages 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against viad 
although the amount of liability as of december  with respect to these matters is not ascertainable  viad believes that any resulting liability  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on viad s business  financial position or results of operations 
viad is subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which viad has or had operations

based upon the information available to viad from plan administrators  management believes that several of these multi employer plans are underfunded 
the pension protection act of requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce  over defined time periods  the underfunded status 
in addition  under current laws  the termination of a plan  or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by viad  or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan would require viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
as of december   the amount of additional funding  if any  that viad would be required to make related to multi employer pension plans is not ascertainable 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements viad does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special purpose or other entities that would materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
furthermore  viad does not have any relationships with special purpose or other entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or engage in leasing or other services that expose the company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in viad s consolidated financial statements 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on october of each year 
goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
viad s reporting units are defined  and goodwill is tested  at either an operating segment level  or at the component level of an operating segment  depending on various factors including the internal reporting structure of the operating segment  the level of integration among components  the sharing of assets among components  and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations 
during  viad had goodwill related to its ges  becker group and brewster operating segments 
for impairment testing purposes  ges goodwill is assigned to and tested at the ges component level  based on its discrete geographical operations in the united states  the united kingdom melville and canada 
both the becker group and brewster operating segments are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology income approach in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
during the first and second quarters of  viad performed interim goodwill impairment testing due to reduced demand for the company s goods and services as a result of the current recessionary environment  uncertainties in the marketplace and the global economic downturn in general 
there was no indicated impairment of goodwill as a result of this testing  however  the company did experience a narrowing of the margin between the estimated fair values of the reporting units and their related net book values under step one of the goodwill impairment test 
during the third quarter of  viad revised downward its forecast for future revenues and earnings in its marketing events group based on continued declines in trade show marketing spending by its customers and a sharper than expected decline in retail holiday d cor demand 
as a result  the company had projected a more prolonged contraction in its trade show and retail marketing revenues than was previously anticipated 
due to these facts and circumstances  viad performed a preliminary interim impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets during the third quarter of as a result of the interim evaluation  management determined that there was an indicated impairment of goodwill at each of ges three reporting units  and at becker group 
accordingly  viad recorded aggregate goodwill impairment losses of million related to its marketing events group  which was included in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption goodwill impairment losses 
the aggregate goodwill impairment losses consisted of million at the ges reporting segment and million at becker group  which is included in the experiential marketing services reporting segment 
the impairment losses discussed above were based on the company s preliminary impairment evaluation 
management finalized the impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter of concurrent with its required annual impairment testing  which did not result in any adjustments to the amounts initially recorded 
the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital discount rate applied to those cash flows 
furthermore  the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates discount rates are estimated using a build up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit 
in order to assess the 
table of contents reasonableness of its fair value estimates  the company performed a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to viad s market capitalization 
as noted above  the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
these estimates  however  have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results 
as of december   viad had remaining aggregate goodwill of million recorded in its consolidated balance sheets 
the amount of goodwill assigned to each of ges reporting units in the united states  the united kingdom melville and canada was million  million and million  respectively  as of december  the amount of goodwill assigned to the brewster reporting unit as of december  was million 
the entire amount of goodwill previously assigned to the becker group reporting unit has been written off 
furthermore  as a result of the company s most recent analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  the excess of the estimated fair values over the carrying values expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts under step one of the impairment test were percent  percent and percent  respectively  for each of ges reporting units in the united states  the united kingdom melville and canada 
for the brewster reporting unit  the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was percent as of the most recent impairment test 
due to the substantial uncertainties in the current economic environment  further reductions in the company s expected future revenue  operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections  or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital  could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing  which may result in additional impairment losses 
furthermore  management continues to monitor the market capitalization of the company as ongoing declines in market capitalization could be indicative of possible goodwill impairment 
other intangible assets not subject to amortization  which primarily consist of trademarks and trade names  are also tested for impairment annually on october of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
other intangible assets not subject to amortization are also reviewed annually to determine whether an indefinite useful life remains appropriate 
the company also uses an income approach to measure the estimated fair values of its trademarks and trade names not subject to amortization 
intangible assets subject to amortization are stated at cost  net of accumulated amortization  and are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows 
intangible assets subject to amortization primarily consist of customer contracts and relationships  non compete agreements  proprietary technology and design libraries 
as a result of the factors discussed above  viad also performed interim and annual impairment evaluations of other intangible assets during in conjunction with its goodwill impairment testing 
as a result  the company recorded aggregate other intangible asset impairment losses of million during  which were included in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption intangible asset impairment losses 
of the total amount  million was recorded during the third quarter of  and consisted of million of impairment losses related to a trade name  customer relationships  design libraries and proprietary technology intangible assets at becker group and million related to a trade name at melville ges united kingdom reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded impairment losses of million related to various trade names at ges and becker group 
the fourth quarter impairment losses resulted primarily from consolidation and integration activities within the marketing events group 
the assumptions used to complete the evaluation of other intangible assets were consistent with those used in the goodwill impairment testing described above 
to the extent that goodwill and another asset of the same reporting unit were tested at the same time  the other asset was tested for impairment before goodwill 
as of december   the company had aggregate intangible assets not subject to amortization of  and aggregate intangible assets subject to amortization of million 
as noted above  due to the substantial uncertainties in the current economic environment  further reductions in the company s expected revenue  operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections could trigger additional impairment testing for these intangible assets  which may result in additional impairment losses 
income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
the company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
these deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences  and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 

table of contents for the cumulative three year period ending december   viad had a pre tax operating loss  which was primarily the result of the goodwill and other impairment losses recorded during the company considered the negative evidence of this cumulative pre tax operating loss position on the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
viad also considered positive evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets including the company s historical and forecasted taxable income  taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities 
furthermore  viad also considered the fact that the goodwill impairment losses are not tax deductible  and thus do not contribute to tax losses 
as of both december  and  viad had a valuation allowance of  related to certain state deferred tax assets at exhibitgroup giltspur 
with respect to all other deferred tax assets  management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more likely than not 
as noted above  viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
as a result  there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets  which is primarily dependent on viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods 
in light of the company s recent operating losses  and the risks and uncertainties in the current economic environment  it is possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of viad s deferred tax assets may change  which could result in a material increase in the company s valuation allowance 
if such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur  it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made 
viad is subject to regular and recurring audits by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company conducts or had previously conducted operations 
these include us federal and most state jurisdictions  and certain foreign jurisdictions including canada  the united kingdom and germany 
effective january   viad adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  codified in fasb accounting standards codification topic  which provides guidance on how to address uncertainty in accounting for income tax assets and liabilities and prescribes a more likely than not threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as of january   the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin resulted in a net decrease to retained earnings of million  an increase to accrued income taxes of million and an increase to deferred tax assets of million 
viad exercises judgment in determining its income tax provision due to transactions  credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as of december   viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of million none as of december  
in addition  as of december  and  viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of  and million  respectively 
viad classifies interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as a component of income tax expense 
the company recorded tax related interest expense of  million and million  during  and  respectively 
during  and  viad recorded tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively 
these favorable tax resolutions primarily represent the reversal of amounts accrued for tax and related interest and penalties in connection with uncertain tax positions which were effectively settled or for which there was a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations 
in addition to the above  viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of  as of both december  and in addition  as of december  and  viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of  and  respectively 
future tax resolutions or settlements that may occur related to these uncertain tax positions would be recorded through discontinued operations net of federal tax effects  if applicable 
as of december   viad did not have any unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations  however  the company had  of accrued tax related interest 
if amounts accrued are less than amounts ultimately assessed by the taxing authorities  viad would record additional income tax expense 
to the extent that the company determines that accrued amounts are no longer needed due to a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations or other reasons  such liabilities would be reversed as a reduction of income tax expense net of federal tax effects  if applicable in the period such determination is made 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the entire amount of accrued interest could be resolved or settled within the next months  which would reduce the amount of accrued income taxes payable 
if such tax resolutions or settlements occur  they could result in cash payments  the recognition of additional income tax expense  or the reversal of accrued income taxes which may impact viad s effective tax rate in future periods 
the company had been subject to certain foreign tax audits in multiple canadian jurisdictions related to the through tax years 
as a result of such audits  certain issues had been raised regarding the tax treatment of specific intercompany debt transactions 
these uncertain tax positions had been accrued as tax liabilities  as the company had not previously recognized any 
table of contents tax benefits associated with those transactions in its income tax provision 
during the fourth quarter of  viad reached a joint settlement agreement with the canadian taxing jurisdictions pertaining to the through tax audits 
the settlement agreement resulted in gross tax reassessments of million consisting of million of tax due  and million of related interest 
as of december   the total amount of million was included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other current liabilities 
viad paid the reassessments of million in january in addition  the joint settlement agreement also resulted in certain tax reassessments for which the company would receive aggregate tax refunds of million 
as of december   the amount of million was included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other current assets 
the company received these refunds in february insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million as of december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels  which generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefits viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
the company presently anticipates contributing  to its funded pension plans and  to its unfunded pension plans in viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad expects to contribute  to the plans in the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was ten percent  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  the weighted average discount rates used to determine the domestic funded pension  domestic unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations were percent  percent and percent in  respectively  and percent for all plans in the weighted average discount rates used to determine the foreign pension benefit obligations as of december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the domestic plans for and were percent and percent  respectively 
the net periodic benefit cost for the foreign pension plans used weighted average discount rates of percent and percent for and  respectively 
the discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review  and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high quality  hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets used to determine the domestic net periodic pension cost for and was percent and percent  respectively 
the foreign pension plans used a rate of percent for both and the expected return on plan assets used to determine net periodic postretirement benefit cost for and was percent and percent  respectively

share based compensation viad grants share based compensation awards to officers  directors and certain key employees pursuant to the viad corp omnibus incentive plan the plan 
the plan has a ten year life and provides for the 
table of contents following types of awards a incentive and non qualified stock options  b restricted stock and restricted stock units  c performance units or performance shares  d stock appreciation rights  e cash based awards and f certain other stock based awards 
the number of shares of common stock available for grant under the plan is limited to  shares plus shares awarded under the viad corp omnibus incentive plan which terminated in may that subsequently cease for any reason to be subject to such awards other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards to the extent the shares are exercised for  or settled in  vested and non forfeited shares up to an aggregate maximum of  shares

share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
furthermore  the total tax benefits related to such costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
no share based compensation costs were capitalized during  or the fair value of restricted stock and performance based restricted stock awards are based on viad s stock price on the date of grant 
liability based awards are recorded at estimated fair value  based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals where applicable and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on viad s stock price until the time of settlement 
viad uses the black scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary 
these assumptions include viad s expected stock price volatility  the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding  the expected dividend yield on viad common stock  and the risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants  and consequently impact viad s results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the earnings of viad 
commodity risk is the risk that changing prices will adversely affect results of operations 
viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in canada and the united kingdom and to a lesser extent in certain other countries 
the functional currency of viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
accordingly  for purposes of consolidation  viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  
table of contents significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar may result in material changes to viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets 
viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in stockholders equity of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during and  an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of million and a loss of million  respectively  were recorded in other comprehensive income 
in addition  for purposes of consolidation  the revenues  expenses  gains and losses related to viad s foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period 
as a result  viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations  when translated  may vary from period to period  even when the functional currency amounts have not changed 
such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons 
viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results 
as noted above  viad primarily conducts its foreign operations in canada and the united kingdom 
accordingly  the operating results related to its canadian subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of  and for  and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by approximately million in from the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar as it relates to the translation of its canadian operations 
a hypothetical change of ten percent in the canadian exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately million 
the operating results related to its united kingdom subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of  and for  and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by approximately million in from the weakening of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
a hypothetical change of ten percent in the british pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary 
from time to time  viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  net of the effect of the related forward contracts  has historically been immaterial to viad s consolidated results of operations 
as of december  and  viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
viad is exposed to short term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations 
viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations 
as of december  viad had variable rate debt outstanding of million under the credit facility 
interest payments related to viad s variable rate debt outstanding are indexed to libor 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in short term interest rates of and basis points  viad s income from continuing operations before income taxes would have been lower by approximately  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices 
periodically  brewster enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume  by fuel product  to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract  which is generally no longer than one year 
the main objective of viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins 
there were no fuel contracts outstanding as of december  or
