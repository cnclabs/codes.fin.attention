item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations 
although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays  we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal years and executive officers of the company our executive officers are as follows name age position ho woltz iii president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board michael c

risk factors you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on form k  including the following risk factors  before investing in any of our securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports and statements that we file with the sec in the future 

table of contents our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products 
demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the credit markets 
our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications 
demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity  which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control 
the tightening in the credit markets that occurred during fiscal and persisted in could continue to unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole 
future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow 
our shipments are generally lower in the first and second quarters primarily due to the reduced level of activity in the construction industry resulting from winter weather conditions together with customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays 
as a result  our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors 
demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels 
demand for our products is highly variable 
the short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products 
in some cases  unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers 
the combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales  profitability and cash flows 
our customers may be adversely affected by the continued negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets 
current negative macroeconomic conditions and the tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements  thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us 
further  the reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us 
the continuation or occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
demand for our products could be significantly impacted by the timing in resolving a new federal transportation funding authorization and the magnitude of the infrastructure related funding that is provided for requiring the use of our products 
the previous federal transportation funding authorization  safetea lu  expired in september and has been extended on an interim basis through december the additional federal funding provided for under the american recovery and reinvestment act arra has not had a significant impact on the demand for our products as a high proportion of the projects funded have been for pavement resurfacing and repairs  which do not require the use of our products  and any favorable impact has been offset by reduced spending at the state and local government level 
failure to enact a new long term federal authorization in a timely manner that provides for increased infrastructure related funding could have a negative impact on demand for our products 
our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material  hot rolled carbon steel wire rod 
the primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets 
beginning in fiscal  a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal in response to the increased pricing volatility  wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments  typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments 
although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated  depending upon market conditions  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations 
additionally  should raw material costs decline  our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory  as we experienced during certain periods of fiscal and 
table of contents our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements 
trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can also have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duty margins by the department of commerce against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market  which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years 
if we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements  we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner  which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs 
we may not be successful in integrating the business acquired in the ivy transaction  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
our recent acquisition of certain of the assets of ivy the ivy transaction involves the integration of businesses that have previously operated independently 
we expect the combination of the businesses will allow for the realization of synergies that reduce operating costs and provide other operational benefits 
there can be no assurance  however  regarding when or the extent to which the combined business will be able to realize these synergies 
successful integration will depend on our ability to consolidate operations  implement procedures and integrate the employees  assets and systems of ivy with our own 
this integration process is subject to delays  disruptions and other challenges  which may include potential loss of key employees or customers  possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies between the businesses and the need to implement company wide financial  accounting  information and other systems  failure to maintain the quality of service and products that we or ivy have historically provided  costs associated with employee redeployment  relocation or severance  costs associated with reorganizing or closing facilities  or relocating or disposing of excess equipment  the diversion of management s attention from our day to day business and broader business strategy as a result of the need to address delays  disruptions and other challenges and the potential need to add management resources to do so  commitment of resources that are needed in other parts of our business  and unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the ivy transaction 
these delays  disruptions and other challenges  if they occur and are not effectively resolved  may cause us to fail to realize the anticipated synergies from the ivy transaction  and may have a material adverse short and long term impact on our operating results and financial condition 
foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results 
our pc strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that in most market environments  domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand 
if we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers  or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower  our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted 
in response to irrationally priced import competition from offshore pc strand suppliers  we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations 
in  we  together with a coalition of domestic producers of pc strand  obtained a favorable determination from the us department of commerce the doc in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of pc strand from brazil  india  korea  mexico and thailand were being dumped or sold in the us at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic pc strand industry 
the doc imposed anti dumping duties ranging from up to  which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market 
in june  we  together with a coalition of domestic producers of pc strand  obtained favorable determinations from the doc in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of pc strand from china were being dumped or sold in the us at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to chinese pc strand producers by the chinese government  both of which had injured the domestic pc strand industry 
the doc imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from to and anti dumping margins ranging from to  which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of chinese producers in the domestic market 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures  operational interruptions and casualty losses 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products  including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires  explosions  accidents  
table of contents adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions 
any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns  periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime 
furthermore  the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures 
although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events  our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance 
our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs 
our employee benefit costs  particularly our medical and workers compensation costs  have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise 
in march  congress passed and the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act 
this legislation may have a significant impact on health care providers  insurers and others associated with the health care industry 
if this legislation significantly increases the costs attributable to our self insured health plans  it may negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  higher prices for natural gas  electricity  fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs 
most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers 
although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs  there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective 
if we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance 
our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities 
although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our million revolving credit facility  we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business 
a material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility  which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition 
any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms  which could adversely impact our operations  growth plans  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs 
our business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs 
these laws and regulations  which are constantly evolving  are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
our production and earnings could be reduced by strikes or work stoppages by our unionized employees 
as of october   we employed people  of which were represented by a labor union at our wilmington  delaware facility 
we have a collective bargaining agreement in place with the union that expires on november  should we experience a disruption of production  we have contingency plans in place that we believe would enable us to continue serving our customers  although there can be no assurances that a strike  slowdown or work stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results 
our stock price can be volatile  often in connection with matters beyond our control 
equity markets in the us have often been volatile 
during fiscal  our common stock traded as high as and as low as 
there are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  several of which are beyond our control  including variations in our quarterly and annual operating results  changes in our business outlook  changes in market valuations of companies in our industry  changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction  and announcements by us  our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations

insteel s corporate headquarters and iwp s sales and administrative offices are located in mount airy  north carolina 

table of contents at october   we operated six manufacturing facilities located in dayton  texas  gallatin  tennessee  hickman  kentucky  mount airy  north carolina  sanderson  florida  and wilmington  delaware 
in connection with the ivy transaction on november   we added production facilities located in hazleton  pennsylvania  jacksonville  florida  kingman  arizona  and st 
joseph  missouri  in addition to the production equipment at a facility in houston  texas which we lease from ivy 
we own all of our real estate with the exception of the houston  texas facility  which is leased from ivy 
we believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained 
we also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate for the current and projected needs for our existing products 
item legal proceedings 
on november   dwyidag systems international  inc dsi filed a third party lawsuit in the ohio court of claims alleging that certain epoxy coated strand sold by us to dsi in  and supplied by dsi to the ohio department of transportation odot for a bridge project  was defective 
the third party action sought recovery of any damages which could have been assessed against dsi in the action filed against it by odot  which allegedly could have been in excess of million  plus million in damages allegedly incurred by dsi 
in  the ohio court granted our motion for summary judgment as to the third party claim against it on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired  but dsi filed an interlocutory appeal of that ruling 
in addition  we previously filed a lawsuit against dsi in the north carolina superior court in surry county seeking recovery of million plus interest owed for other products sold by us to dsi  which action was removed by dsi to the us district court for the middle district of north carolina 
on october   subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  we participated in a structured mediation with odot and dsi which led to settlement of all of the above legal matters 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the legal proceedings in ohio and north carolina will be dismissed and the parties have agreed to release each other from all liability arising out of the sale of strand for the bridge project 
in connection with the settlement  we wrote off the remaining outstanding balance that was owed to us by dsi and agreed to make certain cash payments to odot 
we believe the resolution of this matter will enable us to reinstate the commercial relationship with dsi that had existed prior to the initiation of the legal proceedings 
our fiscal results reflect a pre tax charge of million relating to the net effect of the settlement 
in may  we  together with a coalition of domestic producers of pc strand  filed antidumping ad and countervailing duty cvd petitions with the us department of commerce doc alleging that imports of pc strand from china were being dumped or sold in the us at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to chinese pc strand producers by the chinese government  both of which had served to injure the domestic pc strand industry 
following the completion of its investigative process  on june   the doc ruled in favor of the petitioners  imposing final cvd margins ranging from to and ad margins ranging from to  which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of chinese producers in the domestic market 
we are also  from time to time  involved in various other lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including commercial  environmental and employment matters  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
we do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

the matters discussed in this section include forward looking statements that are subject to numerous risks 
you should carefully read the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors in this form k 
overview following our exit from the industrial wire business see note to the consolidated financial statements  our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry 
the results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our business strategy is focused on achieving leadership positions in our markets  operating as the lowest cost producer  and pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic footprint 
recent developments in furtherance of our business strategy  on november   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  iwp  purchased certain of the assets of ivy for approximately million million of cash and a million secured subordinated note payable to ivy over five years 
the ivy transaction serves to both further our penetration of existing markets and expand our geographic footprint by adding  among other assets  inventory and production facilities located in hazleton  pennsylvania  jacksonville  florida  kingman  arizona  and st 
joseph  missouri 
we also acquired production equipment located at the houston  texas facility and entered into a sublease for our use of that facility 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information  actuarial estimates  historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments  assumptions and estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such  are excluded from revenue 
concentration of credit risk 
financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable 
our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution  which at times exceeds federally insured limits 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet 
we invest excess cash primarily in money market funds  which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk 
most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the us and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
there is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us 
significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances 
these judgments and estimates consider such factors as customers financial position  cash flows and payment history as well as current and expected business conditions 
it is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances 
adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers 
inventory valuation 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory 
this evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations  providing for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory  future demand  our historical experience and market conditions 
in assessing the realization of inventory values  we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions 
because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates  it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates 
adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than the assumptions underlying our estimates 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns 
because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  future adjustments to these reserves may be required 
litigation 
from time to time  we may be involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur 
we record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel  the outcome of similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits and other factors 
due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions  it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates 
we monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock option grants  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units  in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
under these provisions  compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we use the monte carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  future adjustments to compensation expense may be required 
assumptions for employee benefit plans 
we account for our defined employee benefit plans  the insteel wire products company retirement income plan for hourly employees  wilmington  delaware the delaware plan and the supplemental employee retirement plans each  a serp in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
under the provisions of asc topic  we recognize net periodic pension costs and value pension assets or liabilities 
table of contents based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rates we utilize for determining net periodic pension costs and the related benefit obligations for our plans are based  in part  on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies 
our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long term bonds 
the discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year 
the discount rate for the delaware plan was  and for  and  respectively 
the discount rate for the serps was  and for  and  respectively 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the delaware plan represents the estimated average rate of return expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan s assets to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
the amount of net periodic pension cost that is recorded each year is based on the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and  when appropriate  rebalance the investments in the plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation 
for  and  the assumed long term rate of return utilized for plan assets of the delaware plan was 
we currently expect to use the same assumed rate for the long term return on plan assets in in determining the appropriateness of this assumption  we considered the historical rate of return of the plan assets  the current and projected asset mix  our investment objectives and information provided by our third party investment advisors 
the projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the serps are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels 
our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and management s intentions regarding future compensation increases  which generally approximates average long term inflation rates 
assumed discount rates and rates of return on plan assets are reevaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in the recognition of materially different pension costs over different periods and materially different asset and liability amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter lives than assumed in the mortality tables that are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
under gaap  actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income over future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
however  any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains 
the amounts recognized as net periodic pension cost and as pension assets or liabilities are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used for determining the net periodic pension costs and pension assets or liabilities related to the delaware plan are reasonable and appropriate 
the funding requirements for the delaware plan are based upon applicable regulations  and will generally differ from the amount of pension cost recognized under asc topic for financial reporting purposes 
no contributions were required to be made to the delaware plan during  and we currently expect to record net periodic pension costs totaling  during  although we do not expect any cash contributions to the delaware plan will be required during the year 
contributions to the serps are expected to total  during  matching the required benefit payments 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate for the delaware plan would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of october  by approximately  and the expected net periodic pension cost for by approximately  a decrease in the assumed discount rate for our serps would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of october  by approximately  and  respectively  and increased the net periodic pension cost for by approximately  
table of contents a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the delaware plan would have increased the expected net periodic pension cost for by approximately  recent accounting pronouncements 
current adoptions in december  the fasb amended certain provisions of asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
this amendment requires objective disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets including investment policies and strategies  categories of plan assets  fair value measurements of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk 
this amendment is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted this amendment as of the fiscal year ended october  while the adoption of the amendment expanded our disclosures  it did not impact any amounts reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended certain provisions of asc topic  earnings per share

the cash surrender value of life insurance polices increased  in the current year period compared with a decrease of  in the prior year period due to the related changes in value of the underlying investments 
the decreases in consulting and labor expense were primarily due to the implementation of various cost reduction measures 
the reduction in employee benefit costs was primarily due to lower employee medical expense during the current year 
the decrease in payroll taxes was due to the taxes incurred associated with the payment of the fiscal employee incentive plan bonuses during the prior year

table of contents compared with net sales net sales decreased to million in from million in shipments for the year decreased while average selling prices declined from the prior year levels 
the reduction in shipments was primarily due to the general economic downturn  the tightening in credit markets and the surge in low priced imports of pc strand during  which resulted in customer inventory destocking through most of the year 
the decline in average selling prices was driven by the collapse in steel prices that occurred through most of the current year together with weakening demand following the unprecedented escalation in raw material costs and selling prices that occurred during the prior year 
gross profit loss the gross loss for was million  or of net sales compared to gross profit of million  or of net sales in the gross loss for the year reflects a pre tax charge of million for inventory write downs to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market resulting from the decline in selling prices for certain products during the year relative to higher raw material costs under the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
the gross loss for the current year also reflects the unfavorable impact of the reductions in shipments and selling prices  the consumption of higher cost inventory that was purchased prior to the collapse in steel prices and the escalation in unit conversion costs resulting from reduced operating schedules at our manufacturing facilities 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense decreased to million  or of net sales in from million  or of net sales in primarily due to reductions in employee incentive plan expense million  supplemental employee retirement plan expense  travel expense  and bad debt expense 
the reduction in employee incentive plan expense was related to the decline in our financial performance during the current year 
the reduction in travel expense was primarily due to the implementation of various cost reduction measures 
these reductions were partially offset by the net gain on a life insurance settlement in the prior year  and increases in stock based compensation expense  legal expense  employee benefit costs  and consulting expense 
the increase in legal expense was primarily associated with the trade cases that were filed regarding imports of pc strand from china 
the increase in employee benefit expense was largely due to higher employee medical costs

net working capital provided million in and used million in the cash provided by working capital in was due to the million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from reductions in shipments and selling prices  and the million decrease in inventories excluding the impact of the inventory write downs resulting from our inventory reduction initiatives 
these decreases were partially offset by the million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses that was primarily due to the payment of million of accrued income taxes payable and lower raw material purchases 
the cash used by working capital in was due to the million increase in inventories and the million increase in accounts receivable resulting from an escalation in raw material costs and selling prices  which were partially offset by an million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses largely related to higher raw material purchases 
as the impact and duration of the current economic slowdown become clearer  we may make additional adjustments in our operating activities  which could materially impact our cash requirements 
while an economic slowdown adversely affects sales to our customers  it generally reduces our working capital requirements 
investing activities of continuing operations used million of cash during compared to million during and million during capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to total million for fiscal  primarily due to our million acquisition of assets from ivy on november  current year investing activities also includes a  increase in the cash surrender value of insurance policies related to premium payments and changes in the value of the underlying investments compared to  in and  in prior year investing activities also includes  of proceeds from the surrender of life insurance policies compared to  in investing activities in also includes million of proceeds from claims on life insurance policies 
investing activities of discontinued operations provided million of cash during due to the proceeds received from the sale of the real estate associated with our discontinued industrial wire business 
investing activities are largely discretionary and future outlays could be reduced significantly or eliminated should economic conditions warrant 

table of contents financing activities used million of cash during compared to million and million during and  respectively 
during the current year  million of cash dividends were paid compared to million and million during and  respectively 
financing activities in also include  of financing costs that were incurred in connection with the amendment of our credit facility 
additionally  million of shares were repurchased during cash management our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution  which at times exceeds federally insured limits 
we invest excess cash primarily in money market funds  which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk 
credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility in place  which matures in june and supplements our operating cash flow in funding our working capital  capital expenditure and general corporate requirements 
no borrowings were outstanding on the credit facility as of october  and october  and outstanding letters of credit totaled  and million  respectively 
as of october   million of borrowing capacity was available under the credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that  in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands  cash and cash equivalents  and net cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends and share repurchases  if any 
we can also access the amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
however  further deterioration in general economic conditions could result in additional reductions in demand from our customers  which would likely reduce our operating cash flows 
our operating cash flows could also be unfavorably impacted by unanticipated cash requirements arising in connection with the ivy transaction 
under such circumstances  we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures  delay or restrict share repurchases  cease dividend payments and or realign our working capital requirements 
should we determine  at any time  that we require additional short term liquidity  we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that are potentially available to provide such funding 
there can be no assurance that any such financing  if pursued  would be obtained  or if obtained  would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us 
however  we believe that our strong balance sheet  flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation we are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material  hot rolled steel wire rod  and  to a much lesser extent  freight  energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes 
we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives 
however  our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics  and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs 
during  we implemented price increases in response to the unprecedented escalation in wire rod costs  which materially increased our net sales and earnings as we consumed lower cost inventory 
in contrast  during  selling prices for our products declined dramatically in response to softening demand and the inventory destocking measures pursued by our customers  which negatively impacted our financial results as we consumed higher cost inventory that was purchased prior to the collapse in steel prices 
during  our ability to fully recover higher wire rod prices has been mitigated by competitive pricing pressures resulting from the ongoing weakness in demand 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  as defined by item a of regulation s k of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations and commitments at october  are as follows

contractual commitments for capital expenditures 
outlook our visibility for business conditions in is clouded by the continued uncertainty regarding future economic conditions and the prospects for a pronounced recovery in the employment market  the availability of financing in the credit markets and the timing and magnitude of the next federal transportation funding authorization 
we expect nonresidential construction  our primary demand driver  to remain at depressed levels particularly for commercial projects which have been the most severely impacted by the economic downturn 
we believe the favorable impact from the infrastructure related funding provided for under arra has largely been mitigated by the project mix  which is skewed towards pavement resurfacing and repairs that do not require the use of our products together with reduced spending at the state and local government level 
we expect that residential construction will remain weak  but gradually improve over the course of the year  favorably impacting shipments to customers that have greater exposure to the housing sector 
following an extended upward trend that began in december  prices for our primary raw material  hot rolled steel wire rod  have moderated in recent months and competitive pricing pressures have intensified in a weak demand environment 
the timing and magnitude of any future changes in the prices for wire rod and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time 
in response to the challenges facing us  we will continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business closely managing and controlling our expenses  aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs  and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing  selling and administrative activities 
we also expect gradually increasing contributions from the substantial investments we have made in our facilities in recent years in the form of reduced operating costs and additional capacity to support future growth when market conditions improve see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
in addition to these organic growth and cost reduction initiatives  we are continually evaluating potential acquisitions in our existing businesses that further our penetration in current markets served or expand our geographic footprint  as reflected by our decision to consummate the ivy transaction in november item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary 
commodity prices we are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material  hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
we negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign steel wire rod purchases for varying periods most recently monthly for domestic suppliers  depending upon market conditions  to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for steel wire rod 
our ability to acquire steel wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is 
table of contents impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign taxes  duties  tariffs and other trade actions 
although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time  depending upon market conditions and competitive dynamics  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which would reduce our gross profit and cash flow from operations 
additionally  should wire rod costs decline  our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory 
based on our shipments and average rod cost reflected in cost of sales  a increase in the price of steel wire rod would have resulted in a million decrease in our annual pre tax earnings assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices 
interest rates although we were debt free as of october   future borrowings under our revolving credit facility are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange exposure we have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and any such transactions historically have not been material 
we will occasionally hedge firm commitments for equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case by case basis 
there were no forward contracts outstanding as of october  during fiscal  a increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
