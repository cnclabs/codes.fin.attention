item a 
risk factors our business faces many risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our securities could decline 
the us economy entered an economic recession  and we expect this to continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations  including  without limitation  the credit quality of our loan portfolio  our liquidity and our earnings 
you should know that many of the risks described may apply to more than just the subsection in which we grouped them for the purpose of this presentation 
as a result  you should consider all of the following risks  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k  before deciding to invest in our securities 
risks related to our lending activities our results of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb actual losses 
experience in the financial services industry indicates that a portion of our loans in all categories of our lending business will become delinquent or impaired  and some may only be partially repaid or may never be repaid at all 
our methodology for establishing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses depends on subjective determinations and judgments about our borrowers ability to repay 
despite management s efforts to estimate the specific allowance  ultimate resolutions of specific loans may result in actual losses that are greater than our specific allowance 
deterioration in general economic conditions and unforeseen risks affecting customers may have an adverse effect on our borrowers capacity to repay their obligations  whether our risk ratings or valuation analyses reflect those changing conditions 
changes in economic and market conditions may increase the risk that the allowance would become inadequate if borrowers experience economic and other conditions adverse to their businesses 
maintaining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses may require that we make significant and unanticipated increases in our provisions for loan losses  which would materially affect our results of operations and capital adequacy 
recognizing that many of our loans individually represent a significant percentage of our total allowance for loan losses  adverse collection experience in a relatively small number of loans could require an increase in our allowance 
federal and state regulators  as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions  periodically review a portion of our allowance for loan losses 
the regulatory agencies may require changes to classifications or grades on loans  increases in the allowance for loan losses with large provisions for loan losses and recognition of further loan charge offs based upon their judgments  which may be different from ours 
any increase in the allowance for loan losses required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not recover all amounts that are contractually owed to us by our borrowers 
we charged off million in loans for the year ended december   and  in light of current economic and market conditions  we expect to experience additional charge offs and delinquencies in the future 
if we experience material losses on our portfolio  such losses would have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our business and on our revenues  net income and assets  to the extent the losses exceed our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  like other commercial lenders  we have experienced missed and late payments  failures by clients to comply with operational and financial covenants in their loan agreements and client performance below that which we expected when we originated the loan 
any of these events may be an indication that our risk of credit loss with respect to a particular loan has materially increased 
we make loans to other lenders and commercial real estate developers which have been disproportionately negatively impacted by the economic recession 
these clients face a variety of risks  any of which may negatively impact their results of operations and impair their ability to pay principal and interest on our loans 
we make loans to other lenders to finance their real estate lending operations and to other clients for development  construction and renovation projects 
the ability of these clients to make required payments to us on these loans is subject to the risks associated with their loans and these projects 
an unsuccessful loan by  or development  construction or renovation project of  any such client could limit that client s ability to repay its obligations to us 
our concentration of loans to a limited number of clients within a particular industry  including commercial real estate  or region could impair our revenues if the industry or region were to experience continued or worsening economic difficulties or changes in the regulatory environment 
defaults by our clients may be correlated with economic conditions affecting particular industries or geographic regions 
as a result  if any particular industry or geographic region were to experience continuing or worsening economic difficulties  the overall timing and amount of collections on our loans to clients operating in those industries or geographic regions may differ from what we expected and result in material harm to our revenues  net income and assets 
as of december   billion  or of our commercial loan portfolio consisted of loans to seven clients that are individually greater than million 
of the loans held by these clients  five were commercial real estate loans totaling million 
these loans are among the largest and pose the highest risk of loss upon default in our portfolio 
as of december   all of these loans were performing  however  if any of these loans were to experience problems  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the commercial real estate sector is currently experiencing severe economic difficulties  and we expect this sector to deteriorate further in which case we are likely to suffer additional losses on these types of loans as well as increases in loan to value  delinquencies and foreclosures 
we have limited experience owning  operating and developing real estate owned reo properties we obtain through foreclosures 
in addition  as of december   loans representing of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio were to clients in the healthcare industry 
reimbursements under the medicare and medicaid programs comprise the bulk of the revenues of many of these clients 
our clients dependence on reimbursement revenues could cause us to suffer losses in several instances 
if clients fail to comply with operational covenants and other regulations imposed by these programs  they may lose their eligibility to continue to receive reimbursements under the program or incur monetary penalties  either of which could result in the client s inability to make scheduled payments to us 
if reimbursement rates do not keep pace with increasing costs of services to eligible recipients  or funding levels decrease as a result of increasing pressures from medicare and medicaid to control healthcare costs  our clients may not be able to generate adequate revenues to satisfy their obligations to us 
if a healthcare client were to default on its loan  we would be unable to invoke our rights to the pledged receivables directly as the law prohibits payment of amounts owed to healthcare providers under the medicare and medicaid programs to be directed to any entity other than the actual providers 
consequently  we would need a court order to force collection directly against these governmental payors 
there is no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining this type of court order 
we make loans to privately owned small and medium sized companies that present a greater risk of loss than loans to larger companies 
our portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans to small and medium sized  privately owned businesses 
compared to larger  publicly owned firms  these companies generally have limited access to capital and higher funding costs  may be in a weaker financial position and may need more capital to expand or compete 
these financial challenges may make it difficult for our clients to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on our loans 
accordingly  loans made to these types of clients entail higher risks than loans made to companies who are able to access a broader array of credit sources 
we may not have all of the material information relating to a potential client at the time that we make a credit decision with respect to that potential client or at the time we advance funds to the client 
as a result  we may suffer losses on loans or make advances that we would not have made if we had all of the material information 
there is generally no publicly available information about the privately owned companies to which we lend 
therefore  we must rely on our clients and the due diligence efforts of our employees to obtain the information that we consider when making our credit decisions 
to some extent  our employees depend and rely upon the management of these companies to provide full and accurate disclosure of material information concerning their business  financial condition and prospects 
we may not have access to all of the material information about a particular client s business  financial condition and prospects  or a client s accounting records may be poorly maintained or organized 
the client s business  financial condition and prospects may also change rapidly in the current economic environment 
in such instances  we may not make a fully informed credit decision which may lead  ultimately  to a failure or inability to recover our loan in its entirety 
increases in interest rates could negatively affect our clients ability to repay their loans 
most of our loans bear interest at variable interest rates 
if interest rates increase  interest obligations of our clients may also increase 
some of our clients may not be able to make the increased interest payments  resulting in defaults on their loans 
a client s fraud could cause us to suffer losses 
the failure of a client to accurately report its financial position  compliance with loan covenants or eligibility for initial or additional borrowings could result in the loss of some or all of the principal of a particular loan or loans including  in the case of revolving loans  amounts we may not have advanced had we possessed complete and accurate information 
some of our clients require licenses  permits and other governmental authorizations to operate their businesses  which may be revoked or modified by applicable governmental authorities 
any revocation or modification could have a material adverse effect on the business of a client and  consequently  the value of our loan to that client 
in addition to clients in the healthcare industry subject to medicare and medicaid regulation  clients in other industries require permits and licenses from various governmental authorities to operate their businesses 
these governmental authorities may revoke or modify these licenses or permits if a client is found to be in violation of any regulation to which it is subject 
in addition  these licenses may be subject to modification by order of governmental authorities or periodic renewal requirements or changes as a result of changes in the law 
the loss of a permit  whether by termination  modification or failure to renew  could impair the client s ability to continue to operate its business in the manner in which it was operated when we made our loan to it  which could impair the client s ability to generate cash flows necessary to service our loan or repay indebtedness upon maturity  either of which outcomes would reduce our revenues  cash flow and net income 
see the supervision and regulation section of item  business  above for additional discussion of specific regulatory and governmental oversight applicable to many of our healthcare clients 
our loans to foreign clients may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in loans to us clients 
loans to foreign clients may expose us to risks not typically associated with loans to us clients 
these risks include changes in exchange control regulations  political and social instability  expropriation  imposition of foreign taxes  less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the united states  higher transaction costs  less developed bankruptcy laws  difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations  lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility 
to the extent that any of our loans are denominated in foreign currency  these loans will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies 
among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances  the level of short term interest rates  differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies  long term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation  and political developments 
we may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks  but we can offer no assurance that these strategies will be effective 
because of the nature of our loans and the manner in which we disclose client and loan concentrations  it may be difficult to evaluate our risk exposure to any particular client or group of related clients 
we use the term client to mean the legal entity that is the borrower party to a loan agreement with us or the tenant of one of our healthcare owned properties 
we have several clients that are related to each other through common ownership or management 
because we underwrite each transaction separately  we report each transaction with one of these clients as a separate transaction and each client as a separate client 
in situations where clients are related through common ownership  to the extent the common owner suffers financial distress  the common owner may be unable to continue to support our clients  which could  in turn  lead to financial difficulties for those clients 
further  some of our healthcare clients are managed by the same entity and  to the extent that management entity suffers financial distress or is otherwise unable to continue to manage the operations of the related clients  those clients could  in turn  face financial difficulties 
in both of these cases  our clients could have difficulty servicing their debt to us  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we may be unable to recognize or act upon an operational or financial problem with a client in a timely fashion so as to prevent a loss of our loan to that client 
our clients may experience operational or financial problems that  if not timely addressed by us  could result in a substantial impairment or loss of the value of our loan to the client 
we may fail to identify problems because our client did not report them in a timely manner or  even if the client did report the problem  we may fail to address it quickly enough or at all 
although we attempt to minimize our credit risk by carefully monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and through prudent loan approval practices in all categories of our lending  we cannot assure you that such monitoring and approval procedures will reduce these lending risks or that our credit administration personnel  policies and procedures will adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio 
as a result  we could suffer loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  net income and results of operations 
we may make errors in evaluating information reported by our clients and  as a result  we may suffer losses on loans or advances that we would not have made if we had properly evaluated the information 
we underwrite our loans based on detailed financial information and projections provided to us by our clients 
even if clients provide us with full and accurate disclosure of all material information concerning their businesses  our investment officers  underwriting officers and credit committee members may misinterpret or incorrectly analyze this information 
mistakes by our staff and credit committees may cause us to make loans that we otherwise would not have made  to fund advances that we otherwise would not have funded or result in losses on one or more of our existing loans 
our balloon loans and bullet loans may involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans 
as of december   approximately of the outstanding balance of our commercial loans comprised either balloon loans or bullet loans 
a balloon loan is a term loan with a series of scheduled payment installments calculated to amortize the principal balance of the loan so that  upon maturity of the loan  more than  but less than  of the loan balance remains unpaid and must be satisfied 
a bullet loan is a loan with no scheduled payments of principal before the maturity date of the loan 
all of our revolving loans and some of our term loans are bullet loans 
balloon loans and bullet loans involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans because they require the borrower to  in many cases  make a large  final payment upon the maturity of the loan 
the ability of a client to make this final payment upon the maturity of the loan typically depends upon its ability either to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the loan prior to maturity  to refinance the loan or to sell the related collateral securing the loan  if any 
the ability of a client to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors  including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to the client  the financial condition of the client  the marketability of the related collateral  the operating history of the related business  tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions 
consequently  a client may not have the ability to repay the loan at maturity  and we could lose some or all of the principal of our loan 
we are limited in pursuing certain of our rights and remedies under our term b  second lien and mezzanine loans  which may increase our risk of loss on these loans 
term b loans generally are senior secured loans that are equal as to collateral and junior as to right of payment to clients other senior debt 
second lien loans are junior as to both collateral and right of payment to clients senior debt 
mezzanine loans may not have the benefit of any lien against clients collateral and are junior to any lienholder both as to collateral if any and payment 
collectively  term b  second lien and mezzanine loans comprised of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio as of december  as a result of the subordinate nature of these loans  we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights to collect principal and interest on these loans or to recover any of the loan balance through our right to foreclose upon collateral 
for example  we typically are not contractually entitled to receive payments of principal on a subordinated loan until the senior loan is paid in full  and may only receive interest payments on a term b  second lien or mezzanine loan if the client is not in default under its senior loan 
in many instances  we are also prohibited from foreclosing on a term b  second lien or mezzanine loan until the senior loan is paid in full 
moreover  any amounts that we might realize as a result of our collection efforts or in connection with a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under a term b  second lien or mezzanine loan must generally be turned over to the senior lender until the senior lender has realized the full value of its own claims 
these restrictions may materially and adversely affect our ability to recover the principal of any non performing term b  second lien or mezzanine loans 
the collateral securing a loan may not be sufficient to protect us from a partial or complete loss if we have not properly obtained or perfected a lien on such collateral or if the loan becomes non performing  and we are required to foreclose 
while most of our loans are secured by a lien on specified collateral of the client  there is no assurance that we have obtained or properly perfected our liens  or that the value of the collateral securing any particular loan will protect us from suffering a partial or complete loss if the loan becomes non performing and we move to foreclose on the collateral 
our leveraged loans are not fully covered by the value of assets or collateral of the client and  consequently  if any of these loans becomes non performing  we could suffer a loss of some or all of our value in the loan 
leveraged lending involves lending money to a client based primarily on the expected cash flow  profitability and enterprise value of a client rather than on the value of its assets 
as of december   approximately of the commercial loans in our portfolio were leveraged loans under which we had advanced of the aggregate outstanding commercial loan balance of our portfolio 
while in the case of our senior leveraged loans we generally take a lien on substantially all of the client s assets  the value of those assets is typically substantially less than the amount of money we advance to a client under a leveraged loan 
when a leveraged loan becomes non performing  our primary recourse to recover some or all of the principal of our loan is to force the sale of the entire company as a going concern 
we could also choose to restructure the company in a way we believe would enable it to generate sufficient cash flow over time to repay our loan 
neither of these alternatives may be an available or viable option or generate enough proceeds to repay the loan 
additionally  given the current economic conditions  many businesses suffer decreases in revenues and net income  and we expect that many of our leveraged clients will suffer these decreases making them more likely to underperform and default on our loans and making it less likely that we could obtain sufficient proceeds from a restructuring or sale of the company 
if we are a subordinate lender rather than the senior lender in a leveraged loan  our ability to take remedial action is constrained by our agreement with the senior lender 
we are not the agent for a portion of our loans and  consequently  have little or no control over how those loans are administered or controlled 
we are neither the agent of the lending group that receives payments under the loan nor the agent of the lending group that controls the collateral for purposes of administering the loan on loans comprising approximately of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio as of december  when we are not the agent for a loan  we may not receive the same financial or operational information as we receive for loans for which we are the agent and  in many instances  the information on which we must rely is provided to us by the agent rather than directly by the client 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to track or rate these loans than it is for the loans for which we are the agent 
additionally  we may be prohibited or otherwise restricted from taking actions to enforce the loan or to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or otherwise exercise remedies without the agreement of other lenders holding a specified minimum aggregate percentage  generally a majority or two thirds of the outstanding principal balance 
it is possible that an agent for one of these loans may not manage the loan to our standards or may choose not to take the same actions to enforce the loan  to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or to exercise remedies that we would or would not take if we were agent for the loan 
we also could experience losses in the event of the bankruptcy of the agent 
we are the agent for loans in which syndicates of lenders participate and  in the event of a loss on any such loan  we could have liability to other members of the syndicate related to our management and servicing of the loan 
we are often the agent representing a syndicate of multiple lenders that has made a loan 
in that capacity  we may act on behalf of our co lenders in administering the loan  receiving all payments under the loan and or controlling the collateral for purposes of administering the loan 
as of december   we were either the paying  administrative or the collateral agent or all for a group of third party lenders for loans with outstanding commitments of billion 
when we are the agent for a loan  we often receive financial and or operational information directly from the borrower and are responsible for providing some or all of this information to our co lenders 
we may also be responsible for taking actions on behalf of the lending group to enforce the loan  to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or to exercise remedies 
it is possible that as agent for one of these loans we may not manage the loan to the applicable standard 
in addition  we may choose a different course of action than one or more of our co lenders would take to enforce the loan  to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or to exercise remedies if our co lenders were in a position to manage the loan 
if we do not administer these loans in accordance with our obligations and the applicable legal standards and the lending syndicate suffers a loss on the loan  we may have liability to our co lenders 
we may purchase distressed loans at amounts that may exceed what we are able to recover on these loans 
we may purchase loans of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties  including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings 
although these investments may result in significant returns to us  they involve a substantial degree of risk 
any one or all of the loans which we purchase may be unsuccessful or not show any return for a considerable period of time 
the level of analytical sophistication  both financial and legal  necessary for making a profit on the purchase of loans to companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is particularly high 
we may not correctly evaluate the value of the assets collateralizing the loans or the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action 
in any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a distressed company  we may lose the entire amount of our loan  may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than our purchase price and or may be required to accept payment over an extended period of time 
debtor in possession loans may have a higher risk of default 
debtor in possession loans to clients that have filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code are used by these clients to fund on going operations as part of the reorganization process 
while security position for these loans is generally better than that of the other asset based loans  there may be a higher risk of default on these loans due to the uncertain business prospects of these clients and the inherent risks with the bankruptcy process 
furthermore  if our calculations as to the outcome or timing of reorganization are inaccurate  the client may not be able to make payments on the loan on time or at all 
our loans could be subject to equitable subordination by a court which would increase our risk of loss with respect to such loans 
courts may apply the doctrine of equitable subordination to subordinate the claim or lien of a lender against a borrower to claims or liens of other creditors of the borrower  when the lender or its affiliates is found to have engaged in unfair  inequitable or fraudulent conduct 
the courts have also applied the doctrine of equitable subordination when a lender or its affiliates is found to have exerted inappropriate control over a client  including control resulting from the ownership of equity interests in a client 
we own direct equity investments or warrants in connection with loans representing approximately of the aggregate outstanding balance of our commercial loan portfolio as of december  payments on one or more of our loans  particularly a loan to a client in which we also hold an equity interest  may be subject to claims of equitable subordination 
if we were deemed to have the ability to control or otherwise exercise influence over the business and affairs of one or more of our clients resulting in economic hardship to other creditors of our client  this control or influence may constitute grounds for equitable subordination and a court may treat one or more of our loans as if it were unsecured or common equity in the client 
in that case  if the client were to liquidate  we would be entitled to repayment of our loan on a pro rata basis with other unsecured debt or  if the effect of subordination was to place us at the level of common equity  then on an equal basis with other holders of the client s common equity only after all of the client s obligations relating to its debt and preferred securities had been satisfied 
we may incur lender liability as a result of our lending activities 
a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories  collectively termed lender liability 
generally  lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty  whether implied or contractual  of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders 
we are and may in the future be subject to allegations of lender liability 
we cannot assure you that these claims will not continue to arise or that we will not be subject to significant liability in connection with these types of claims 
at the parent company  we have engaged in the past  and may engage in the future  in lending transactions with affiliates of our directors 
because of the conflicts of interest inherent in these transactions  their terms may not be in our shareholders best interests 
as of december   we had five loans representing million in committed funds to companies affiliated with our directors 
we may make additional loans to affiliates of our directors in the future 
although we generally require these transactions to be approved by the disinterested members of our board or a committee thereof  such policy may not be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts of interest 
these transactions may divert our resources and benefit our directors and their affiliates to the detriment of our shareholders 
if we do not obtain or maintain the necessary state licenses and approvals  we will not be allowed to acquire  fund or originate residential mortgage loans and other loans in some states  which would adversely affect our operations 
we engage in consumer mortgage lending activities which involve the collection of numerous accounts  as well as compliance with various federal  state and local laws that regulate consumer lending 
many states in which we do business require that we be licensed  or that we be eligible for an exemption from the licensing requirement  to conduct our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all the necessary licenses and approvals  or be granted an exemption from the licensing requirements  that we will need to maximize the acquisition  funding or origination of residential mortgages or other loans or that we will not become liable for a failure to comply with the myriad of regulations applicable to our lines of business 
we are in a competitive business and may not be able to take advantage of attractive opportunities 
our markets are competitive and characterized by varying competitive factors 
we compete with a large number of financial services companies  including commercial banks and thrifts  specialty and commercial finance companies  private investment funds  insurance companies  and investment banks 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and market positions than we do 
they also have greater access to capital than we do and at a lower cost than is available to us 
furthermore  we would expect to face increased price competition if finance companies seek to expand within or enter our target markets 
increased competition could cause us to reduce our pricing and lend greater amounts as a percentage of a client s eligible collateral or cash flows 
even with these changes  in an increasingly competitive market  we may not be able to attract and retain new clients or maintain or grow our business and our market share and future revenues may decline 
if our existing clients choose to use competing sources of credit to refinance their loans  the rate at which loans are repaid may be increased  which could change the characteristics of our loan portfolio as well as cause our anticipated return on our existing loans to vary 
risks impacting funding our operations our ability to operate our business depends on our ability to maintain our external financing  which is challenging in the existing economic environment 
we require a substantial amount of money to make new loans  repay indebtedness  fund obligations to existing clients and otherwise operate our business 
to date  we have obtained this money through issuing equity  secured notes  convertible debentures  mortgage debt and subordinated debt  by borrowing money under our credit facilities  term debt including securitization transactions  borrowings from the federal home loan bank san francisco and through deposits at capitalsource bank 
prior to  we had completed several securitizations transactions involving loans in our commercial lending portfolio through which we raised a significant amount of debt capital 
the market for securitized loans has effectively been closed since our access to these and other types of external funding depends on a number of factors  including general market and deposit raising conditions  the markets and our lenders perceptions of our business  our current and potential future earnings and financial performance and the market price of our common stock 
the capital and credit markets disruptions continue to constrain our ability to access and maintain prudent levels of liquidity through the sources described above 
if the recession and levels of credit and capital markets disruption continue or worsen  it is not certain that sufficient funding and capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
without sufficient funding  we would not be able to continue to operate our business 
the parent company may not sell loans to capitalsource bank and capitalsource bank is prohibited from paying dividends to the parent company for its first three years of operation 
consequently  while capitalsource bank may have more than adequate liquidity  the parent company is unable to directly benefit from that liquidity to fund its significant obligations and operations and must rely to a large extent on external sources of financing which  as described above  are limited 
required commitment reductions  proceeds restrictions and mandatory redemption provisions under our indebtedness may limit our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity 
we are required to reduce the commitments of the lenders under our syndicated bank credit facility that did not extend the maturity of their commitments to us under the facility representing million as of december  and fully repay any amounts due by march  in addition  to the extent not earlier reduced by the events described below  the commitments of the lenders that did extend the maturity of their commitments to us under the facility representing million as of december  are required to be reduced to million by april  and to million on january  thereafter  such commitments will further reduce by million per month until november  and terminate entirely on december  in addition  the commitments under our syndicated bank credit facility will reduce  and we will be required to make payments as necessary to prevent outstanding borrowings from exceeding such commitments  in million increments based on a portion of proceeds realized from specified events  including of the cash proceeds of any unsecured debt issuance by the parent company  and of any principal repayments on  or the cash proceeds received on the disposition of or the incurrence of secured debt with respect to  assets constituting collateral under the facility 
the terms of our first priority senior secured notes due in july the senior secured notes require that proceeds of some asset sales not applied as described above must be used to make offers to purchase these notes instead of for other purposes 
in addition  if we voluntarily reduce the amount of outstanding obligations under our syndicated bank credit facility  the terms of certain of our warehouse credit facilities and securitization trusts require a proportional prepayment 
the terms of our outstanding convertible debentures require us to make offers to repurchase them in and as of december  the principal amounts of convertible debentures that we may be required to purchase in those years are million in july and million in july if the conversion prices of all of these debentures remain significantly out of the money  we would expect that all of the holders would elect to tender their debentures to us in response to these offers  requiring us to pay the respective principal amounts in cash at the conclusion of each offer 
if we are unable to sell sufficient assets  raise new capital or restructure these payment obligations  we may not have sufficient liquidity to make these required prepayments by these dates 
consequently  we could default on these payment obligations  which would trigger cross defaults under our other debt and could result in accelerated maturity of all of our debt 
in such circumstances  our business  liquidity and operations would be materially adversely affected  and we may not be able to continue operating 
we must comply with various covenants and obligations under our indebtedness and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to operate our business  manage our portfolio or pursue certain opportunities 
the parent company is subject to financial and non financial covenants under our indebtedness  including  without limitation  with respect to restricted payments  interest coverage  minimum tangible net worth  leverage  maximum delinquent and charged off loans  servicing standards  and limitations on incurring or guaranteeing indebtedness  refinancing existing indebtedness  repaying subordinated indebtedness  making investments  dividends  distributions  redemptions or repurchases of our capital stock  selling assets  creating liens and engaging in a merger  sale or consolidation 
if we were to default under our indebtedness by violating these covenants or otherwise  our lenders remedies would include the ability to  among other things  transfer servicing to another servicer  foreclose on collateral  accelerate payment of all amounts payable under such indebtedness and or terminate their commitments under such indebtedness 
our failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could cross default to all or a substantial portion of our debt 
in the past  we have received waivers to potential breaches of some of these provisions 
in the future  we may have difficulty complying with some of these provisions if economic conditions affecting our industry fail to improve  and we may need to obtain additional waivers or amendments again in the future if we cannot satisfy all of the covenants and obligations under our debt 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such waivers or amendments in the future 
a default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  liquidity position and our ability to continue to operate our business 
in addition  upon the occurrence of specified servicer defaults  our lenders under our credit facilities and the holders of the notes issued in our term debt securitizations may elect to terminate us as servicer of the loans under the applicable facility or term debt securitizations and appoint a successor servicer or replace us as cash manager for our secured facilities and term debt securitizations 
if we were terminated as servicer  we would no longer receive our servicing fee 
in addition  because there can be no assurance that any successor servicer would be able to service the loans according to our standards  the performance of our loans could be materially adversely affected and our income generated from those loans significantly reduced 
substantially all of the assets of the parent company are pledged or otherwise encumbered by liens we have granted in favor of our lenders 
the restrictive covenants in our syndicated bank credit facility  the indenture relating to our senior secured notes and the documents governing our other indebtedness may  among other things  impair our ability and reduce our flexibility to operate our business  restrict our ability to optimally restructure our existing debt  plan for or react to changes in our business  the economy and or markets  or limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition or results of operations 
our failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt 
our significant level of debt and interest payment obligations may limit our ability to compete  expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our senior secured notes 
as of december   the parent company had in excess of billion of indebtedness outstanding 
this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including those relating to our senior secured notes  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  including interest rate fluctuations  because a significant portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our ability to borrow additional funds to expand our business or alleviate liquidity constraints  as a result of financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  limit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have less indebtedness 
if our lenders terminate or fail to renew any of our credit facilities  we may not be able to continue to fund our business 
as of december   we had four credit facilities totaling million in commitments 
one of these credit facilities aggregating million in commitments is scheduled to mature during we may not be able to renew or extend the term of these financings or to repay amounts outstanding under them when due 
additionally  if we breach a covenant or other provision of these facilities  the lenders could terminate them prior to their maturity dates 
if any of these financings were terminated  not renewed upon its maturity or renewed on materially worse terms  our liquidity position could be materially adversely affected  and we may not be able to satisfy our outstanding obligations or continue to fund our operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to satisfy our obligations under our credit facilities or receive additional waivers or amendments should they be needed to avoid future defaults 
we are not currently eligible to maintain a universal shelf registration statement  which could adversely affect our ability to quickly and efficiently access the public capital markets 
for the past several years  we have maintained an effective universal shelf registration statement registering the continuous offering and sale of a variety of securities 
as a result  we have been able to offer and sell our securities  including through our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  to the public without having to file a new registration statement for each offering  thereby avoiding delays that can be associated with possible review by the staff of the securities and exchange commission the sec  and the necessity for the staff to formally declare the effectiveness of any such registration statement 
on october   we filed with the commission a current report on form k to report that a member of our board had notified one of our officers on october  that he had decided not to stand for reelection at the company s annual meeting 
because the k was not filed within the prescribed period of four business days from the date of the director s notice  it was not considered timely  with the consequence of terminating our status as a well known seasoned issuer and terminating our eligibility to maintain our universal shelf registration statement 
assuming we file on a timely basis all required filings and continue to satisfy the other requirements of a well known seasoned issuer  we would expect to again be eligible to file and maintain a universal shelf registration statement beginning november  until then  should we choose to raise capital in one or more registered offerings  we would be obligated to file a post effective amendment on form s to the universal shelf registration statement  or a new registration statement on form s  for each such offering  resulting in the possibility of delays due to review of such filings by the commission staff 
if the staff elects to review such a filing  the potential delay could be approximately two months 
although we do not have any immediate plans to conduct a registered offering  we periodically assess opportunities to raise capital on favorable terms in light of our capital needs from time to time 
we believe that our ability to access the capital markets rapidly  and to execute a favorable transaction with little advance notice  has been and will likely continue to be important to our financial condition and liquidity  and that our inability to maintain a universal shelf registration statement could have a material adverse impact on our ability to so access the public markets 
the risks of delay associated with registered offerings could lead us to pursue private placements instead of registered offerings  which could make our capital raising efforts more costly and time consuming and could increase the execution risk associated with them due to the more limited universe of investors in private placements as compared to public offerings 
our commitments to lend additional amounts to existing clients exceed our resources available to fund these commitments 
as of december   the amount of the parent company s unfunded commitments to extend credit with respect to existing loans exceeded unused funding sources and unrestricted cash by billion 
due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
in many cases  our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is subject to our clients ability to provide collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements  our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing  including compliance with all provisions of the loan agreements  and or our discretion pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements 
in other cases  however  there are no such prerequisites to future fundings by us  and our clients may draw on these unfunded commitments at any time 
in light of current economic conditions and constraints on liquidity in the credit markets  clients may seek to draw on our unfunded commitments to improve their cash positions 
due to this fact and because of potential constraints on our liquidity  we expect that these unfunded commitments will continue to exceed the parent company s available funds 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace  which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate our business 
our cash flows from the interests we retain in our term debt securitizations have been  and we expect will continue to be  delayed or reduced due to the requirements of the term debt securitizations 
we generally have retained the most junior classes of securities issued in our term debt securitizations 
our receipt of cash flows on those junior securities is governed by provisions that control the distribution of cash flows from the loans included in our term debt securitizations  which cash flows are tied to the performance of the underlying loans 
as more delinquencies among loans included in the collateral pools of billion of our outstanding term debt securitizations have occurred  the timing and amount of the cash flows we receive from loans included in our term debt securitizations have been adversely affected and we expect these cash flows will continue to be adversely affected if delinquencies continue or increase 
in addition  under our term debt securitizations  the priority of payments is altered if the notes remain outstanding beyond the stated maturity dates and upon other termination events  in which case we would receive no cash flow from these transactions until the notes senior to our retained interests are retired 
fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our profit margins and ability to operate our business 
we borrow money from our lenders at variable interest rates and raise short term deposits at prevailing rates in the relevant markets 
we generally lend money at variable rates based on either prime or libor indices 
our operating results and cash flow depend on the difference between the interest rates at which we borrow funds and raise deposits and the interest rates at which we lend these funds 
because many of our loans are currently below their contractual interest rate floors  upward movements in interest rates will not immediately result in additional interest income  although these movements would increase our cost of funds 
therefore  any upward movement in rates may result in a reduction of our net interest income 
for additional information about interest rate risk  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk management 
interest on some of our borrowings is based in part on the rates and maturities at which vehicles sponsored by our lenders issue asset backed commercial paper 
changes in market interest rates or the relationship between market interest rates and asset backed commercial paper rates could increase the effective cost at which we borrow funds under some of our indebtedness 
in addition  changes in market interest rates  or in the relationships between short term and long term market interest rates  or between different interest rate indices  could affect the interest rates charged on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  which could result in an increase in interest expense relative to our interest income 
hedging instruments involve inherent risks and costs and may adversely affect our earnings 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements and other contracts for interest rate risk management purposes 
our hedging activities vary in scope based on a number of factors  including the level of interest rates  the type of portfolio investments held  and other changing market conditions 
interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because  among other things interest rate hedging can be expensive  particularly during periods of volatile interest rates  available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability or asset  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay 
because we do not employ hedge accounting  our hedging activity may materially adversely affect our earnings 
therefore  while we pursue such transactions to reduce our interest rate risks  it is possible that changes in interest rates may result in losses that we would not otherwise have incurred if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions 
for additional information  see note derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates 
we may increase our hedging activity and  thus  increase our hedging costs during periods when interest rates are volatile or rising 
furthermore  the enforceability of agreements associated with derivative instruments we use may depend on compliance with applicable statutory  commodity and other regulatory requirements and  depending on the identity of the counterparty  applicable international requirements 
in the event of default by a counterparty to hedging arrangements  we may lose unrealized gains associated with such contracts and may be required to execute replacement contract s on market terms which may be less favorable to us 
although generally we seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions  it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty  and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk 
we cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold  and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration  which could result in losses 
we may enter into derivative contracts that could expose us to future contingent liabilities 
part of our investment strategy involves entering into derivative contracts that require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances 
our ability to fund these contingent liabilities will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to funding sources at the time  and the need to fund these contingent liabilities could materially adversely impact our financial condition 
for additional information  see note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  risks related to our operations we may fail to maintain or raise sufficient deposits or other sources of funding at capitalsource bank to operate our business 
capitalsource bank s ability to maintain or raise sufficient deposits may be limited by several factors  including competition from a variety of competitors  many of which offer a greater selection of products and services and have greater financial resources  including  without limitation  other banks  credit unions and brokerage firms  as a california state chartered industrial bank  capitalsource bank is permitted to offer only savings  money market and time deposit products  which limitations may adversely impact its ability to compete effectively  and perceptions of capitalsource bank s quality could be adversely affected by depositors negative views of the parent company  which could cause depositors to withdraw their deposits or seek higher rates 
while we expect to maintain and continue to raise deposits at a reasonable rate of interest  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully 
in addition  given the short average maturity of capitalsource bank s deposits to the maturity of its loans  the inability of capitalsource bank to raise or maintain deposits could compromise our ability to operate our business  impair our liquidity and threaten the solvency of capitalsource bank and the rest of capitalsource 
aside from deposit funding  capitalsource bank may obtain back up liquidity from the fhlb sf  the frb  and the parent company 
the availability of these sources of funds may be limited or threatened in the event of a severe economic crisis 
the access to borrowing from fhlb sf may be materially impacted should congress alter or dissolve the federal home loan bank system 
our access to the frb primary credit program may be materially impacted should the frb modify its credit program and limit capitalsource bank s access to the program 
in addition  if the liquidity or financial performance of the parent company weakens  capitalsource bank may not be able to draw on the million revolving credit facility it has established with the parent company 
as a result  if the ability of capitalsource bank to attract and retain suitable levels of deposits weakens  this could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision which limit our flexibility and could result in adverse actions by regulatory agencies against us 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision that govern  limit or otherwise affect the activities in which we may engage  our ability to use our capital for certain business purposes and our ability to expand our business 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not our shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to banking laws or regulations  including changes in their interpretation or implementation  could materially affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit or restrict our ability to use capital for business purposes  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
in addition  increased regulatory requirements  whether due to the adoption of new laws and regulations  changes in existing laws and regulations  or more expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and reputation 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies or the regulatory orders pursuant to which capitalsource bank operates  even if unintentionally or inadvertently  could result  among other things  in sanctions by regulatory agencies  increased deposit insurance costs  civil monetary penalties or fines  issuance of cease and desist or other supervisory orders or reputation damage 
supervisory actions also could result in higher capital requirements  higher insurance premiums and additional limitations on our activities or termination of deposit insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and reputation 
see the supervision and regulation section of item  business  above  note  bank regulatory capital  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and item  financial statements and supplementary data 
we face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings 
if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we may engage in strategic activities  which could include acquisitions  joint ventures  or other business growth initiatives or undertakings 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities  that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities  if undertaken  will be successful 
in order to finance future strategic undertakings  we might obtain additional equity or debt financing 
such financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if obtained  equity financing could be dilutive and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities could have material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to execute strategic activities successfully will depend on a variety of factors 
these factors likely will vary on the nature of the activity but may include our success in integrating the operations  services  products  personnel and systems of an acquired company into our business  operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business  retaining key employees  achieving anticipated synergies  meeting expectations and otherwise realizing the undertaking s anticipated benefits 
our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured 
in addition  our strategic efforts may divert resources or management s attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny 
if we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking  it could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  reputation and growth prospects 
in addition  if we were able to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired  that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us  which should adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  from time to time  we may develop and grow new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts  particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed 
in developing and marketing new lines of business and or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our agreement to sell our direct real estate investments is subject to conditions which may not be met 
in november  we entered into an agreement with omega to sell  in three closings over time  the remainder of our direct real estate investments 
in december  we completed the first closing and sold long term care facilities and anticipate selling an additional long term care facilities to omega under the agreement in the third part of the transaction is an option that can be exercised by omega to acquire additional long term care facilities at any time through december  we and omega have made customary representations  warranties  covenants and indemnifications in the transaction documents  including  among others  covenants regarding the conduct of our entities business and other activities between the execution of the agreement and the closings 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement is subject to customary conditions  and there can be no assurance that the transactions will be consummated 
we and omega have termination rights pursuant to the agreement 
as a result  the future closings of the transactions may not be completed on schedule or at all 
the a participation interest may not pay down to the extent necessary to avoid losses 
as the holder of the a participation interest  we are entitled to receive of principal payments received with respect to the assets underlying the a participation interest  which include both loans and reo 
certain of the loans underlying the a participation interest are in default from time to time 
the loan portfolio underlying the a participation interest includes commercial real estate construction loans which may be more susceptible to default than other commercial loans 
given current economic conditions affecting the commercial and residential real estate markets  we expect the level of defaults  and the level of losses associated with such defaults  to increase 
to the extent losses on the underlying assets exceed expectations  the amount of principal available for distribution to us as the holder of the a participation interest could be reduced to a level which would cause us to experience credit losses 
if losses reach levels in excess of the credit enhancement features of the a participation interest  we could experience losses which would adversely impact our financial results 
although as the holder of the a participation interest we have no obligation to make any further advances with respect to the assets underlying the a participation interest  the failure of istar financial  inc and its subsidiaries istar as the lender with respect to the underlying assets to meet its funding obligations could also contribute to losses on the assets underlying the a participation interest 
we also could experience losses in the event of the bankruptcy of istar 
istar is the guarantor of the payment obligations to us as the holder of the a participation interest and such guaranty may be impaired if istar files for bankruptcy 
in the event of its bankruptcy  it is possible that istar could seek to commingle collections on the a participation interest with its other funds making it difficult to indentify the funds as our property and for us to receive our money 
moreover  the characterization of the a participation interest as a true participation could be challenged in the bankruptcy of istar 
if the challenge were successful  the a participation interest would likely be viewed as a secured loan to istar  entitling istar in certain circumstances to use the collections on the a participation interest and to restructure the obligations owed to us as the holder of the a participation interest as part of a bankruptcy reorganization plan 
we revoked our reit election which could have adverse legal implications 
we operated as a reit through  but revoked our reit election as of january  we had agreed in contracts relating to some of our financings that we will use reasonable efforts to remain qualified as a reit 
while we believe our decision not to qualify as a reit for was reasonable  it could nevertheless be deemed to breach certain of our agreements 
if the counterparties to these financings allege breaches of those agreements  we may be subject to lengthy and costly litigation  and if we were not to prevail in such litigation  we may be required to repay certain indebtedness prior to stated maturity  which would materially impair our liquidity 
if it were determined that we violated reit requirements or failed to qualify as a reit in any given year during which we operated as a reit  it could adversely impact our historical  current and future results of operations 
we operated as a reit from january  through december  our senior management had limited experience in managing a portfolio of assets under the highly complex tax rules governing reits and we cannot assure you that we successfully operated our business within the reit requirements 
given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits and the importance of factual determinations  the internal revenue service  or irs  could contend that we violated reit requirements in one or more of these years 
we are currently under audit by the irs for our  and tax returns 
to the extent it were to be determined that we did not comply with reit requirements for one or more of our reit years  we could be required to pay corporate federal income tax and certain state and local income taxes on our net income for the relevant years or we could be required to pay taxes that would be due if we were to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions to preserve our reit status for the relevant years  either of which could have adverse affects on our historical  current and future financial results and the value of our common stock 
the change of control rules under section of the internal revenue code may limit our ability to use net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes to reduce future tax payments or our willingness to issue equity 
we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes that can be utilized to offset future taxable income 
if we were to undergo a change in ownership of more than of our capital stock over a three year period as measured under section of the internal revenue code  our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  certain built in losses and other tax attributes recognized in years after the ownership change generally would be limited 
the annual limit would equal the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the relevant taxable entity s capital stock immediately before the ownership change 
these change of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of a company s outstanding stock  including certain public groups of stockholders as set forth under section  and those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions  which may limit our willingness and ability to issue new equity 
the determination of whether an ownership change occurs is complex and not entirely within our control 
no assurance can be given as to whether we have undergone  or in the future will undergo  an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code 
the requirements of the investment company act impose limits on our operations that impact the way we acquire and manage our assets and operations 
we conduct our operations so as not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended  or the investment company act 
we believe that we are primarily engaged in the business of commercial lending and real estate investment  and not in the business of investing  reinvesting  and trading in securities  and therefore are not required to register under the investment company act 
while we do not believe we are engaged in an investment company business  we nevertheless endeavor to conduct our operations in a manner that would permit us to rely on one or more exemptions under the investment company act 
our ability to rely on these exemptions may limit the types of loans and other assets we own 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  capitalsource finance llc finance  is a guarantor on certain of our indebtedness  which guarantees could be deemed to cause finance to have outstanding securities for purposes of the investment company act 
finance or other subsidiaries may guarantee future indebtedness from time to time 
even if one or more of our subsidiaries were deemed to be engaged in investment company business  and the provisions of the investment company act were deemed to apply on an individual basis to our wholly owned subsidiaries  generally they could rely either on an exemption from registration under the investment company act for banks or entities that do not offer securities to the public and do not have more than security holders 
because it is possible such reliance could be deemed unavailable to finance or some of our other subsidiaries  we also attempt to conduct finance s and such other subsidiaries businesses in a manner that we believe would permit them to rely on exemptions from registration under the investment company act 
if we or any subsidiary were required to register under the investment company act and could not rely on an exemption or exclusion  we or such subsidiary could be characterized as an investment company 
such characterization would require us to either change the manner in which we conduct our operations  or register the relevant entity as an investment company 
any modification of our business for these purposes could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  if we or a subsidiary were determined to be an unregistered investment company  we or such subsidiary could be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the sec and could be found to be in default of some of our indebtedness  may be unable to enforce contracts with third parties  and third parties could seek to rescind transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we or such subsidiary was an unregistered investment company  would have to significantly reduce the amount of leverage in our business  would have to restructure operations dramatically  may have to raise substantial amounts of additional equity to come into compliance with the limitations prescribed under the investment company act  and may have to terminate agreements with our affiliates 
any of these results likely would have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  financial results and the price of our common stock 
changes in the values of our assets and subsidiaries and the income produced by them have made  and may make  it more difficult for us to maintain our exemptions from the investment company act 
if the market value of or net income from our non qualifying assets at the parent company increase or the market value of or net income from capitalsource bank or our qualifying assets at the parent company decrease  we may need to increase our real estate investments and income and or liquidate our non qualifying assets to maintain our exemptions from the investment company act 
if the declines or increases occur quickly  this may be especially difficult to accomplish 
this difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of many of our assets 
we may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the investment company act consideration  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  financial results and the price of our common stock 
our systems may experience an interruption or breach in security which could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
we rely on the computer and telephone systems and network infrastructure we use to conduct our business 
these systems and infrastructure could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer and telephone equipment against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our clients 
in addition  we must be able to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us against physical damage  security breaches and service disruption caused by the internet or other users 
such break ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and deter potential clients 
while we have systems  policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our systems and infrastructure  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful and that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
in addition  the failure of our clients to maintain appropriate security for their systems also may increase our risk of loss in connection with loans made to them 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of systems and infrastructure could damage our reputation  result in a loss of business and or clients  result in losses to us or our clients  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  cause us to incur additional expenses  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
we review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements  we could be required to implement expensive and time consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports 
this could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our stock price  and could potentially subject us to litigation 
risks related to our direct real estate investments we are exposed to liabilities  including environmental liabilities  with respect to properties to which we take title 
owning real estate can subject us to liabilities for injury to persons on the property or property damage 
to the extent that any such liabilities are not adequately covered by insurance  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to properties we own 
we may be liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases  at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
if we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we have experienced and may continue to experience losses if the creditworthiness of our tenants leasing our healthcare properties deteriorates and they are unable to meet their obligations under our leases 
we own healthcare properties leased to tenants from whom we receive rents during the terms of our leases 
a tenant s ability to pay rent is determined by the creditworthiness of the tenant 
if a tenant s credit deteriorates  the tenant could default on its obligations under our lease and the tenant may also become bankrupt 
the bankruptcy or insolvency or other failure to pay of our tenants is likely to adversely affect the income produced by many of our direct real estate investments 
the operators of our healthcare properties are faced with increased litigation  rising insurance costs and enhanced government scrutiny that may affect their ability to make payments to us 
advocacy groups that monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities have sued healthcare operators and called upon state and federal legislatives to enhance their oversight of trends in healthcare facility ownership and quality of care 
patients have also sued healthcare facility operators and have  in certain cases  succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses 
the effect of this litigation and potential litigation in the future has been to materially increase the costs incurred by our operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance 
in addition  the cost of medical malpractice and liability insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of healthcare facilities continues 
increased costs could limit our operators ability to make payments to us  potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs 
to the extent we are required to remove or replace the operators of our healthcare properties  our revenue from those properties could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time 
risks related to our common stock we may issue additional shares of common stock at prices that are dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we may issue equity or equity linked securities at prices that are dilutive to our shareholders  which may result in a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock 
these issuances could be for cash or in exchange for outstanding debt securities in cases where we either do not have sufficient cash to pay off those debt securities or believe it would be more prudent to conserve our cash 
we may not pay dividends on our common stock 
we expect to retain a majority of our earnings  consistent with dividend policies of other commercial depository institutions  to redeploy in our business 
our board of directors  in its sole discretion  will determine the amount and frequency of dividends to our shareholders based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  borrowing capacity and other factors  including debt covenant restrictions prohibiting the payment of dividends after defaults 
in addition  for so long as our senior secured notes are outstanding  absent meeting certain thresholds  we cannot make cash dividend payments that exceed per share per quarter 
consequently  we can not assure you that we will pay any dividend on our common stock 
if we change our dividend policy our stock price could be adversely affected 
if a substantial number of shares available for sale are sold in a short period of time  the market price of our common stock could decline 
if our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
as of february   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and had issued options then exercisable for  shares 
subject  in some cases  to rule compliance  all of these shares are eligible for sale in the public market 
the perception in the public market that our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress our market price 
a decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities 
similarly  if we were to issue a substantial amount of common stock in exchange for outstanding indebtedness  and the recipients were to sell such common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
some provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for  among other things a classified board of directors  restrictions on the ability of our shareholders to fill a vacancy on the board of directors  the authorization of undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval  and advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals 
we also are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts the ability of any shareholder that at any time holds more than of our voting shares to acquire us without the approval of shareholders holding at least of the shares held by all other shareholders that are eligible to vote on the matter 
these anti takeover defenses could discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions than you desire

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and highlights we are a commercial lender which primarily  through our wholly owned subsidiary  capitalsource bank  provides financial products to middle market businesses and provides depository products and services in southern and central california 
prior to the formation of capitalsource bank  capitalsource inc capitalsource  and together with its subsidiaries other than capitalsource bank  the parent company conducted its commercial lending business through our other subsidiaries 
subsequent to capitalsource bank s formation  substantially all new loans have been originated at capitalsource bank  and we expect this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future 
our commercial lending activities in the parent company consist primarily of satisfying existing commitments made prior to capitalsource bank s formation and receiving payments on our existing loan portfolio 
consequently  we expect that our loans at the parent company will gradually run off  while capitalsource bank s loan portfolio will continue to grow 
as of december   we had  loans outstanding  of which were shared between capitalsource bank and the parent company 
our total loans had an aggregate outstanding balance of billion 
we currently operate as three reportable segments capitalsource bank  other commercial finance  and healthcare net lease 
our capitalsource bank segment comprises our commercial lending and banking business activities  our other commercial finance segment comprises our loan portfolio and other business activities in the parent company  and our healthcare net lease segment comprises our direct real estate investment business activities 
for additional information  see note  segment data  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  through our capitalsource bank segment activities  capitalsource bank provides a wide range of financial products primarily to small and middle market businesses across the united states and also offers depository products and services in southern and central california  which are insured by the fdic to the maximum amounts permitted by regulation 
as of december   capitalsource bank held a million senior participation interest in a pool of commercial real estate loans and related assets the a participation interest and had loans outstanding of which loans were shared with the parent company 
our total loans had an aggregate principal balance held by capitalsource bank of billion 
through our other commercial finance segment activities  the parent company has provided financial products primarily to small and middle market businesses 
as of december   our other commercial finance segment had loans outstanding of which loans were shared with capitalsource bank 
our total loans had an aggregate balance of billion in the parent company 
during the year ended december   we sold long term healthcare facilities with a total net book value of million  realizing a pre tax loss of million 
two transactions comprised of the facilities sold 
in november  we sold long term healthcare facilities the november sale assets for approximately million in cash 
in december  in the first step of a multi step transaction  we sold long term healthcare facilities the step assets to omega healthcare investors  inc omega for approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of omega common stock valued at million 
in addition  by acquiring our facilities in the december closing  omega became obligated to pay us million of indebtedness associated with the step assets 
step two of the transaction with omega will include the sale of an additional long term healthcare facilities the step assets  which we expect to complete in in december  we also received approximately million shares of omega common stock valued at million in consideration for a non refundable option that can be exercised by omega to acquire an additional of our long term healthcare facilities the step assets at any time through december  upon the completion of the sale of step assets and step assets  we will exit the skilled nursing home ownership business  but continue to actively provide financing for owners and operators in the long term healthcare industry 
we have presented the financial condition and results of operations of all assets within our healthcare net lease segment  with the exception of the step assets  as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
additionally  the results of the discontinued operations include the activities of other healthcare facilities that have been sold since the inception of the business 
the step assets have been included in our continuing operations as they do not meet the criteria to be held for sale as of december  for additional information  see note  discontinued operations  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  consolidated results of operations we currently operate as three reportable segments capitalsource bank  other commercial finance  and healthcare net lease 
our capitalsource bank segment comprises our commercial lending and banking business activities  our other commercial finance segment comprises our loan portfolio and other business activities in the parent company  and our healthcare net lease segment comprises our direct real estate investment business activities 
the discussion that follows differentiates our results of operations between our segments 
explanation of reporting metrics interest income 
in our capitalsource bank segment  interest income represents interest earned on loans  the a participation interest  investment securities and cash and cash equivalents  as well as amortization of loan origination fees  net of the direct costs of origination 
in our other commercial finance segment  interest income represents interest earned on loans  coupon interest  other investments and cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  interest income includes amortization of loan origination fees  net of direct costs of amortization and the amortization of purchase discounts and premiums  which are amortized into income using the interest method 
although the majority of our loans charge interest at variable rates that adjust periodically  we also have loans charging interest at fixed rates 
in our healthcare net lease segment  interest income represents interest earned on cash and restricted cash 
fee income 
in our capitalsource bank and other commercial finance segments  fee income represents net fee income earned from our commercial loan operations 
fee income includes prepayment related fees as well as other fees charged to borrowers 
we currently do not generate any fee income in our healthcare net lease segment 
operating lease income 
in our healthcare net lease segment  operating lease income represents lease income earned in connection with direct real estate investments 
our operating leases typically include fixed rental payments  subject to escalation over the life of the lease 
we generally project a minimum escalation rate for the leases and recognize operating lease income on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
we currently do not generate any operating lease income in our capitalsource bank and other commercial finance segments 
interest expense 
interest expense is the amount paid on deposits and borrowings  including the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt discounts 
in our capitalsource bank segment  interest expense includes interest paid to depositors and interest paid on fhlb sf borrowings 
in our other commercial finance segment  interest expense includes borrowing costs associated with repurchase agreements  secured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
in our healthcare net lease segment  interest expense includes borrowing costs associated with mortgage debt 
the majority of our borrowings charge interest at variable rates based primarily on one month libor or commercial paper cp rates plus a margin 
our senior secured notes charge interest at a fixed rate 
our convertible debt  three series of our subordinated debt  our term debt recorded in connection with our investments in mortgage related receivables and the intercompany debt within our healthcare net lease segment bear a fixed rate of interest 
deferred financing fees  debt discounts and the costs of issuing debt  such as commitment fees and legal fees  are amortized over the estimated life of the borrowing 
loan prepayments may materially affect interest expense on our term debt since in the period of prepayment the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt acquisition costs is accelerated 
provision for loan losses 
we record a provision for loan losses in our capitalsource bank and other commercial finance segments 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses inherent in our commercial lending portfolio and in our portfolio of residential mortgage related receivables 
as the size and mix of loans within these portfolios change  or if the credit quality of the portfolios change  we record a provision to appropriately adjust the allowance for loan losses 
we do not have any loan receivables in our healthcare net lease segment 
other expense income 
in our capitalsource bank and other commercial finance segments  other income expense consists of gains losses on the sale of loans  gains losses on the sale of debt and equity investments  unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments  other than temporary impairment on investment securities  available for sale  gains losses on derivatives  due diligence deposits forfeited  unrealized appreciation depreciation of our equity interests in certain non consolidated entities  servicing income  income from our management of various loans held by third parties  income expenses on operations of and gains losses on the sales of our reo  gains losses on debt extinguishment at the parent company  and other miscellaneous fees and expenses not attributable to our commercial lending and banking operations 
in our healthcare net lease segment  other income expense consists of gain loss on the sale of assets 
operating expenses 
in our capitalsource bank and other commercial finance segments  operating expenses include compensation and benefits  professional fees  travel  rent  insurance  depreciation and amortization  marketing and other general and administrative expenses  including deposit insurance premiums 
in our healthcare net lease segment  operating expenses include depreciation of direct real estate investments  professional fees  an allocation of overhead expenses including compensation and benefits and other direct expenses 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes as a c corporation on income earned from operations 
currently  our subsidiaries cannot participate in the filing of a consolidated federal tax return 
as a result  certain subsidiaries may have taxable income that cannot be offset by taxable losses or loss carryforwards of other entities 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal  foreign  state and local taxation in various jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the change 
from through  we operated as a reit 
effective january   we revoked our reit election and recognized the deferred tax effects in our audited consolidated financial statements as of december  during the period we operated as a reit  we were generally not subject to federal income tax at the reit level on our net taxable income distributed to shareholders  but we were subject to federal corporate level tax on the net taxable income of our taxable reit subsidiaries  and we were subject to taxation in various foreign  state and local jurisdictions 
in addition  we were required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders and meet various other requirements imposed by the internal revenue code  through actual operating results  asset holdings  distribution levels  and diversity of stock ownership 
periodic reviews of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets are made to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all evidence  both positive and negative  is evaluated when making this determination 
items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid  the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies  historical financial performance  expectations of future earnings and the length of statutory carryforward periods 
significant judgment is required in assessing future earning trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences 
in  we established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets for subsidiaries where we determined that there was significant negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize such assets 
negative evidence we considered in making this determination included the incurrence of operating losses at several of our subsidiaries  and uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the deferred tax assets at future points in time 
at december   the total valuation allowance was million 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining recognized net deferred tax assets of million as of december  will be realized 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reduction or reversal 
as of december   we recorded no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
operating results for the years ended december   and our results of operations for were impacted by the global recession  a challenging credit market environment  the availability of liquidity  and the effect of revoking our reit election effective january  as further described below  the most significant factors influencing our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to were increased provision for loan losses  increased income tax expense due primarily to deferred tax asset valuation allowances established in and deferred tax benefit recorded in related to the revocation of our reit election  the inclusion of a full year of capitalsource bank operations in  as opposed to five months in as it commenced operations on july   decreased balance of our commercial lending portfolio  gains and losses on our residential mortgage investment portfolio  gains and losses on extinguishment of our debt  losses on derivatives and other investments in our other commercial finance segment  changes in lending and borrowing spreads  and divestiture of a substantial portion of our healthcare net lease segment

interest bearing liabilities include deposits  repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   we sold healthcare facilities and anticipate selling our remaining facilities in and upon the completion of these asset sales  we will exit the skilled nursing facility ownership business  but continue to actively provide financing for owners and operators in the long term healthcare industry 
as a result  all consolidated comparisons below reflect the continuing results of our operations 
for operating information about our discontinued operations  see the healthcare net lease segment section 
operating expenses vs 
the increase in consolidated operating expenses to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operating expenses related to capitalsource bank in  while only five months were included in also contributing to the increase was a million increase in fdic premiums paid by capitalsource bank  including a one time special assessment of million paid to the fdic s deposit insurance fund  which was part of a required payment for all insured institutions  a million increase in rental expenses  primarily due to the addition of capitalsource bank occupancy expenses as well as a new office lease in chevy chase  maryland  and a million increase in professional fees 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in marketing expenses  related primarily to the one time promotion and advertising expenses related to the commencement of capitalsource bank s operations and a million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses 
vs 
the increase in consolidated operating expenses to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  was primarily due to a million increase in professional fees  including a write off of previously capitalized costs related to a terminated merger transaction  fees related to the previously planned initial public offering of capitalsource healthcare reit  consulting fees and legal and other professional fees related to the formation and commencement of operations of capitalsource bank  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulting from increases in depreciation on capitalsource bank s fixed assets  and a million increase in rent and marketing expense related to capitalsource bank 
these increases were primarily offset by a million decrease in total employee compensation and a million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses 
the decrease in employee compensation was primarily due to a million decrease in incentive compensation partially offset by a million increase in salaries 
for the years ended december  and  incentive compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation comprises annual bonuses  as well as expense attributed to stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units  which generally have vesting periods ranging from three to five years 
income taxes vs 
consolidated income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the change in income tax expense was caused primarily by deferred tax asset valuation allowances established in and deferred tax benefit recorded in related to the revocation of our reit election

during the year ended december   continued stress experienced in our commercial real estate loan portfolio was largely responsible for driving the increase in provision for loan losses  charge offs  and delinquent and non accrual loan categories 
refinancing options with commercial real estate loans are currently limited

as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in direct real estate investments  which consisted primarily of land and buildings 
during the year ended december   our gross direct real estate investments decreased by million 
the decrease was due to the sales of long term healthcare facilities  with a total net book value of million  realizing a pre tax loss of million and the impairment of one investment by million 
we anticipate selling our remaining facilities in and upon the completion of these asset sales  we will exit the skilled nursing home ownership business  but continue to actively provide financing for owners and operators in the long term healthcare industry 
as a result  much of the healthcare net lease segment activity and assets are classified as discontinued operations in our audited consolidated balance sheets and audit consolidated statements of operations 
for additional information  see note  discontinued operations  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  investments  available for sale included in investments  available for sale  were million shares of common stock in omega received as partial consideration for the sale of long term healthcare facilities and the option for omega to purchase an additional of our long term healthcare facilities at any time through december  as of december   this stock had a fair value of million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our sources of funds available to meet our obligations as they arise 
we require cash to fund new and existing commercial loan commitments  repay and service indebtedness  make new investments  fund net deposit outflows and pay expenses related to general business operations 
our sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  new borrowings and deposits  proceeds from asset sales  servicing fees on securitizations and credit facilities  principal and interest collections  lease payments and additional equity and debt financings 
capitalsource bank is prohibited from paying dividends during its first three years of operations without consent from our regulators 
consequently  we do not anticipate that dividends from capitalsource bank will provide any liquidity to fund the operations of the parent company for the foreseeable future 
we separately manage the liquidity of capitalsource bank and the parent company 
our liquidity forecasts indicate that we have adequate liquidity to conduct our business 
these forecasts are based on our business plans for the parent company and capitalsource bank and assumptions related to expected cash inflows and outflows that we believe are reasonable  however  we cannot assure you that our forecasts or assumptions will prove to be accurate 
some of our liquidity sources such as cash  deposits and net cash from operations are generally available on an immediate basis 
other sources of liquidity  such as proceeds from asset sales  borrowings on existing facilities and the ability to generate additional liquidity through new equity or debt financings  are less certain and less immediate  are in some cases restricted by our existing indebtedness or borrowing availability  and are dependent on and subject to market and economic conditions and the willingness of counterparties to enter into transactions with us 
accordingly  these sources of additional liquidity may not be sufficient or accessible at all or quickly enough to meet our needs 
unless otherwise specified  the figures presented in the following paragraphs are based on current forecasts and take into account activity since december  the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with  and is subject to and qualified by the information set forth under item a  risk factors  and the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
capitalsource bank liquidity our liquidity forecast is based on our business plan to originate substantially all new loans through capitalsource bank for the foreseeable future  and our expectations regarding the net growth in the commercial loan portfolio at capitalsource bank and the repayment of the a participation interest 
through deposits  cash flow from operations  payments of principal and interest from loans and the a participation interest  cash equivalents  investments  capital contributions from the parent company  borrowings from the fhlb sf and access to other funding sources  we intend to maintain sufficient liquidity at capitalsource bank to fund commercial loan commitments and operations as well as to maintain minimum ratios required by our regulators 
capitalsource bank uses its liquidity to fund new loans and investment securities fund commitments on existing loans  fund net deposit outflows and pay operating expenses  including intercompany payments to the parent company for origination and other services performed on its behalf 
capitalsource bank operates in accordance with the conditions imposed in connection with regulatory approvals obtained upon its formation  including requirements that capitalsource bank maintain a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  capital levels required for a bank to be considered well capitalized under relevant banking regulations  and a ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets of not less than for its first three years of operations 
in addition  we have a policy to maintain of capitalsource bank s assets in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
in accordance with regulatory guidance  we have identified  modeled and planned for the financial  capital and liquidity impact of various events and scenarios that would cause a large outflow of deposits  a reduction in borrowing capacity  a material increase in loan funding obligations  a material increase in credit costs or any combination of these events for capitalsource bank 
we anticipate that capitalsource bank would be able to maintain sufficient liquidity and ratios in excess of its required minimum ratios in these events and scenarios 
capitalsource bank s primary source of liquidity is deposits  most of which are in the form of certificates of deposit 
we expect capitalsource bank to be able to continue to generate sufficient deposits to meet its liquidity needs 
at december   deposits at capitalsource bank were billion  which is approximately of the historical peak deposit levels of the retail deposit branches before we acquired them 
we believe we will be able to maintain a sufficient level of deposits to fund capitalsource bank 
as of december   capitalsource bank had million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and million in investment securities  available for sale 
as of december   the amount of capitalsource bank s unfunded commitments to extend credit with respect to existing loans was million 
due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace 
we anticipate that capitalsource bank will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy these unfunded commitments 
parent company liquidity in  despite the challenging economic environment  we improved our liquidity at the parent company 
we reduced the number of our credit facilities and reduced the outstanding principal balances under these credit facilities by million  extended the maturity dates on our credit facilities to dates between and  and increased our parent company s cash and immediately available funds under our committed facilities 
we accomplished these things through amendments to our indebtedness  new equity and debt issuances  the sale of certain of our healthcare net lease properties  proceeds from loan and asset sales and cash from operations 
the parent company s need for liquidity is less than in prior periods because our business plan is to make substantially all new commercial loans through capitalsource bank for the foreseeable future  and it is our expectation that the balances of our existing loan portfolio and other assets held in the parent company will run off over time 
we intend to generate adequate liquidity at the parent company to cover our estimated funding obligations for commitments under existing loans  to repay recourse indebtedness due in  and to pay operating expenses 
subject to restrictions in our existing indebtedness  sources of liquidity for the parent company that we expect to be available include cash flows from operations  including  principal  interest  and lease payments  credit facility borrowings  servicing fees  equity and debt offerings  our ability to fund loans directly from our a term debt securitization  asset sales  including sales of reo  servicing fees on securitizations and credit facilities  and proceeds from the sale of omega stock and  subject to the various conditions  omega s exercise of its option and future closings on asset sales to omega 
in most instances  a portion of the proceeds from some of these activities are required to be used to make mandatory repayments on our indebtedness 
our current forecast of cash outflows for the parent company includes payments related to mandatory commitment reductions under our syndicated bank credit facility  debt service  operating expenses  any dividends that we may pay and the funding of unfunded commitments 
for additional information  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   the amount of the parent company s unfunded commitments to extend credit with respect to existing loans exceeded unused funding sources and unrestricted cash by billion  a decrease of million  or from december  due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
we expect that these unfunded commitments will continue to exceed the parent company s available funds 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace 
in many cases  our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is subject to our clients ability to provide collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements  our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing  including compliance with all provisions of the loan agreements  and or our discretion pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements 
in other cases  however  there are no such prerequisites or discretion to future fundings by us  and our clients may draw on these unfunded commitments at any time 
to the extent there are unfunded commitments with respect to a loan that is owned partially by capitalsource bank and the parent company  unless our client is in default  capitalsource bank is obligated in some cases pursuant to intercompany agreements to fund its portion of the unfunded commitment before the parent company is required to fund its portion 
in addition  in some cases we may be able to borrow additional amounts under our existing financing sources as we fund these unfunded commitments 
in addition to these unfunded commitments  pursuant to agreements with our regulators  to the extent capitalsource bank independently is unable to do so  the parent company must maintain capitalsource bank s total risk based capital ratio at not less than and must maintain the capital levels of capitalsource bank at all times to meet the levels required for a bank to be considered well capitalized under the relevant banking regulations 
additionally  pursuant to requirements of our regulators  the parent company has provided a million unsecured revolving credit facility to capitalsource bank that capitalsource bank may draw on at any time it or the fdic deems necessary

debt covenants the parent company is subject to financial and non financial covenants under our indebtedness  including  with respect to restricted payments  interest coverage  minimum tangible net worth  leverage  maximum delinquent and charged off loans  servicing standards  and limitations on incurring or guaranteeing indebtedness  refinancing existing indebtedness  repaying subordinated indebtedness  making investments  dividends  distributions  redemptions or repurchases of our capital stock  selling assets  creating liens and engaging in a merger  sale or consolidation 
if we were to default under our indebtedness by violating these covenants or otherwise  our lenders remedies would include the ability to  among other things  transfer servicing to another servicer  foreclose on collateral  accelerate payment of all amounts payable under such indebtedness and or terminate their commitments under such indebtedness 
in addition  upon the occurrence of specified servicer defaults  our lenders under our credit facilities and the holders of the asset backed notes issued in our term debt may elect to terminate us as servicer of the loans under the applicable facility or term debt and appoint a successor servicer or replace us as cash manager for our secured facilities and term debt 
if we were terminated as servicer  we would no longer receive our servicing fee 
in addition  because there can be no assurance that any successor servicer would be able to service the loans according to our standards  the performance of our loans could be materially adversely affected and our income generated from those loans significantly reduced 
during the year ended december   we obtained waivers  extended previously obtained waivers and or executed amendments with respect to some of our indebtedness to avoid potential events of default 
in the past  we have received waivers to potential breaches of some of these provisions 
in the future  we may have difficulty complying with some of these provisions if economic conditions fail to improve  and we may need to obtain additional waivers or amendments again in the future if we cannot satisfy all of the covenants and obligations under our debt 
in february  to avoid potential events of default  we amended the tangible net worth covenant for our syndicated bank credit facility  cs funding iii  cs funding vii  cs europe facilities  and our a term debt securitization for the reporting period ending december  and future periods 
the amendments were obtained to provide certainty that the net loss reported for the quarter and the year ended december   after making certain adjustments as provided for in the covenant definition  would not cause an event of default under these facilities 
for additional information  see note  subsequent events  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  equity in february  we entered into an agreement with an existing security holder and issued  shares of our common stock in exchange for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debentures held by the security holder  and our wholly owned subsidiary  capitalsource finance llc  paid approximately million in cash to the security holder in exchange for the guaranty on such notes by such subsidiary 
we retired all of the debentures acquired in the exchange 
in july  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share  including the approximately million shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to their over allotment option 
in connection with this offering  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
we terminated our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan effective march  for additional information  see note  shareholders equity  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  special purpose entities we use special purpose entities spes as an integral part of our funding activities  and we service loans that we have transferred to these entities 
the use of these special purpose entities is generally required in connection with our non recourse secured debt financings to legally isolate from us loans that we transfer to these entities if we were to enter into a bankruptcy proceeding 
we also used special purpose entities to facilitate the issuance of collateralized loan obligation transactions that are further described below in commitments  guarantees contingencies 
additionally  we have purchased beneficial ownership interests in residential mortgage assets that are held by special purpose entities established by third parties 
we evaluate all spes with which we are affiliated to determine whether such entities must be consolidated for financial statement purposes 
if we determine that such entities represent variable interest entities as defined in the consolidation topic of the codification  we consolidate these entities if we also determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
for special purpose entities for which we determine we are not the primary beneficiary  we account for our economic interests in these entities in accordance with the nature of our investments 
as further discussed in note  mortgage related receivables and related owner trust securitizations  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in february  we acquired beneficial interests in two special purpose entities that acquired and securitized pools of residential mortgage loans 
we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these spes and  therefore  consolidated the assets and liabilities of such entities for financial statement purposes 
additionally  and as further discussed in note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the assets and related liabilities of all special purpose entities that we use to issue our term debt are recognized on our audited consolidated balance sheets as of december  and commitments  guarantees contingencies as of december  and  we had unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients of billion and billion  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  was to our related parties 
for additional information  see note  related party transactions  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
we expect that these unfunded commitments will continue to exceed our parent company s available funds 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and irreparably damage our reputation in the marketplace 
in cases  our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is subject to our clients ability to provide collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements  our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing  including compliance with all provisions of the loan agreements  and or our discretion pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements 
in many other cases  however  there are no such prerequisites to future fundings by us and our clients may draw on these unfunded commitments at any time 
to the extent there are unfunded commitments with respect to a loan that is owned partially by capitalsource bank and the parent company  unless our client is in default  capitalsource bank is obligated in some cases pursuant to intercompany agreements to fund its portion of the unfunded commitment before the parent company is required to fund its portion 
in addition  in some cases we may be able to borrow additional amounts under our secured credit facilities as we fund these unfunded commitments 
we have non cancelable operating leases for office space and office equipment 
the leases expire over the next years and contain provisions for certain annual rent escalations 
in june  the lease for our new office space commenced  which requires estimated minimum payments of million per annum 
the lease term is years with an option to renew for two additional five year periods 
in addition  the lease also includes a sublease to capitalsource bank for a portion of the space 
we are obligated to provide standby letters of credit in conjunction with several of our lending arrangements 
as of december  and  we had issued million and million  respectively  in letters of credit  which expire at various dates over the next six years 
if a borrower defaults on its commitment s subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements  we would be responsible to meet the borrower s financial obligation and would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower 
these arrangements had carrying amounts totaling million and million  as reported in other liabilities in our audited consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
we also provide standby letters of credit under certain of our property leases 
as of december  and  we had identified conditional asset retirement obligations primarily related to the future removal and disposal of asbestos that is contained within certain of our direct real estate investment properties 
the asbestos is appropriately contained and we believe we are compliant with current environmental regulations 
if these properties undergo major renovations or are demolished  certain environmental regulations are in place  which specify the manner in which asbestos must be handled and disposed 
we are required to record the fair value of these conditional liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
as of december  and  sufficient information was not available to estimate our liability for conditional asset retirement obligations as the obligations to remove the asbestos from these properties have indeterminable settlement dates 
as such  no liability for conditional asset retirement obligations was recorded in our audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  and in july  we entered into a limited guarantee for the principal balance and any accrued interest and unpaid fees with respect to indebtedness owing by a company in which we hold an investment 
the guarantee can be called by the lender on the earlier of an acceleration of our syndicated bank credit facility and july  as of december   the principal amount guaranteed was million 
in accordance with the consolidation topic of the codification  we have determined that we are not required to recognize the assets and liabilities of this special purpose entity for financial statement purposes as of december  in connection with certain securitization transactions and secured financings  we have made customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying transferred assets and collateral 
prior to any securitization transaction and secured financing  we generally perform due diligence with respect to the assets to be included in the securitization transaction and the collateral to ensure that they satisfy the representations and warranties 
in our capacity as originator and servicer in certain securitization transactions and secured financings  we may be required to repurchase or substitute loans which breach a representation and warranty as of their date of transfer to the securitization or financing vehicle 
from time to time we are party to legal proceedings 
we do not believe that any currently pending or threatened proceeding  if determined adversely to us  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  including our cash flows 
contractual obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating leases and we have committed to contribute up to an additional million to private equity funds  and million to an equity investment 
the contractual obligations under our debt are included in our audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  the expected contractual obligations under our certificates of deposit  debt  operating leases and commitments under non cancelable contracts as of december   were as follows certificates of credit term convertible subordinated mortgage notes deposit facilities debt debt debt debt payable other total in thousands thereafter total the contractual obligations for credit facilities are computed based on the stated maturities of the facilities including amortization periods but not considering optional annual renewals and assume utilization of available term out features 
the amounts are presented gross of net unamortized discounts of million on our term debt securitizations and million on the senior secured notes and include a liquidity tranche  of which million is not drawn 
contractual obligations on our term debt securitizations are computed based on their estimated lives 
the estimated lives are based upon the contractual amortization schedule of the underlying loans 
these underlying loans are subject to prepayment  which could shorten the life of the term debt securitizations  conversely  the underlying loans may be amended to extend their term  which may lengthen the life of the term debt securitizations 
at our option  we may substitute loans for prepaid loans up to specified limitations  which may also impact the life of the term debt securitizations 
the contractual obligations for convertible debt are computed based on the initial put call date and are presented gross of net unamortized discount of million 
the legal maturities of the convertible debt are and for additional information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the contractual obligations for subordinated debt are computed based on the legal maturities  which are between and includes operating leases and non cancelable contracts 
we enter into derivative contracts under which we either receive cash or are required to pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on our audited consolidated balance sheet as of december   with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the contracts changes daily as market interest rates change 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a client s or counterparty s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
credit risk exists primarily in our lending  leasing and derivative portfolios 
the degree of credit risk will vary based on many factors including the size of the asset or transaction  the credit characteristics of the client  the contractual terms of the agreement and the availability and quality of collateral 
we manage credit risk of our derivatives and credit related arrangements by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding with an individual counterparty  by obtaining collateral based on management s assessment of the client and by applying uniform credit standards maintained for all activities with credit risk 
as appropriate  the parent company and capitalsource bank credit committees evaluate and approve credit standards and oversee the credit risk management function related to our commercial loans  direct real estate investments and other investments 
their primary responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure  overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies  monitoring economic and market conditions having an impact on our credit related activities  and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk and monitoring our client s financial condition and performance 
capitalsource bank and other commercial finance segments credit risk management for the commercial loan portfolios begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of a client based on an analysis of the client s financial position 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a client  each commercial credit exposure or transaction is assigned a risk rating that is subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
while rating criteria vary by product  each loan rating focuses on the same two factors collateral and financial performance 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the client s or counterparty s financial condition  cash flow or financial situation 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios 
in making decisions regarding credit  we consider risk rating  collateral  industry and single name concentration limits 
we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor a client s or counterparty s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we syndicate loan exposure to other lenders  sell loans and use other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of our loan portfolio 
concentrations of credit risk in our normal course of business  we engage in transactions with clients primarily throughout the united states 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration was healthcare and social assistance  which made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   taken in the aggregate  non healthcare commercial real estate made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the largest geographical concentration was florida  which made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration in our direct real estate investment portfolio was skilled nursing  which made up approximately of the investments 
as of december   the largest geographical concentration in our direct real estate investment portfolio was florida  which made up approximately of the investments 
as of december   billion  or  of our commercial loan portfolio consisted of loans to seven clients that are individually greater than million 
as of december   five of these loans were commercial real estate loans totaling million 
as of december   all of these loans were performing  however  if any of these loans were to experience problems  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
derivative counterparty credit risk derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such agreements 
this risk consists primarily of the termination value of agreements where we are in a favorable position 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered and provided for separately from the allowance for loan losses 
we manage the credit risk associated with various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review and monitoring procedures 
we obtain collateral from all counterparties based on terms stipulated in the collateral support annex 
we also monitor all exposure and collateral requirements daily on a per counterparty basis 
we continually monitor the fair value of collateral received from counterparties and may request additional collateral from counterparties or return collateral pledged as deemed appropriate 
our agreements generally include master netting agreements whereby the counterparties are entitled to settle their derivative positions net 
as of december  and  the gross positive fair value of our derivative financial instruments was million and million  respectively 
our master netting agreements reduced the exposure to this gross positive fair value by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we held million and million of collateral against derivative financial instruments as of december  and  respectively 
accordingly  our net exposure to derivative counterparty credit risks as of december  and  was million and million  respectively 
market risk management market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate fluctuations 
this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities  which result in the recognition of assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  including loans  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations  primarily including our loans and borrowings 
our traditional loan products are non trading positions and are reported at amortized cost 
additionally  debt obligations that we incur to fund our business operations are recorded at historical cost 
while us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires a historical cost view of such assets and liabilities  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk in our normal course of business refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates  primarily various short term interest rates  including libor based rates and the prime rate 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of interest rate changes by conducting the majority of our lending and borrowing on a variable rate basis 
the majority of our commercial loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the libor rate or a prime based rate with most of the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
the majority of our borrowings bear interest at a spread to libor or cp  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
our deposits are fixed rate  but at short terms 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates in certain of our fixed rate loans and investments 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to the earnings impact of the interest rate changes in these assets by engaging in hedging activities as discussed below 
for additional information  see note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the estimated decreases in net interest income for a month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december   were as follows in thousands rate change basis points for the purposes of the above analysis  we included related derivatives  excluded principal payments and assumed an advance rate on our variable rate borrowings 
approximately of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our commercial loans had interest rate floors as of december  of the loans with interest rate floors  approximately had contractual rates below the interest rate floor and the floor was providing a benefit to us 
the loans with contractual interest rate floors as of december   were as follows amount percentage of outstanding total portfolio in thousands loans with contractual interest rates below the interest rate floor exceeding the interest rate floor at the interest rate floor loans with no interest rate floor total as of december   the composition of our commercial loan balances subject to interest rate floors by index and by the spread between the floor rate and the fully indexed rate were as follows basis points above floor total in thousands month libor month libor month libor prime canadian prime blended total adjustable rate loans fixed rate loans total loans subject to interest rate floors loans not subject to interest rate floors total loans loans are calculated as principal balance less deferred loan fees and discounts and the allowance for loan losses 
includes lower of cost or fair value adjustments on loans held for sale 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to minimize the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations specific to our fixed rate debt  certain fixed rate loans and certain sale leaseback transactions 
we also enter into additional basis swap agreements to hedge basis risk between our libor based term debt and the prime based loans pledged as collateral for that debt 
these basis swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate and prime rate loans to one month libor 
our interest rate hedging activities partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under fixed rate and prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the one month libor based term debt 
we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain fixed rate debt 
these interest rate swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate debt to one month libor 
we have also entered into relatively short dated forward exchange agreements to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency denominated loans 
for additional information  see note  derivative instruments and note  credit risk  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain of our assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
investment securities  available for sale  mortgage backed securities  warrants and derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
in addition  we may be required  in specific circumstances  to measure certain of our assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  including investment securities  held to maturity  loans held for sale  loans held for investment  direct real estate investments  net of direct real estate investments held for sale  reo  goodwill and certain other investments 
we follow the guidance in the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification in determining the fair value of our assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis 
accordingly  we classify each of these assets and liabilities within level  level or level of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december   and of total assets and total liabilities  respectively  were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
of these assets carried at fair value on a recurring basis  million of total assets were classified as level  million of total assets were classified as level and million of total assets were classified as level as of december  from a liability perspective  million of total liabilities were classified as level as of december  as of december   no liabilities were classified as level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values of level or level financial instruments assets and liabilities that are actively traded in the marketplace or that have values based on readily available market value data require little  if any  subjectivity to be applied when determining the fair value 
these are classified as either level or level whether an asset or liability is classified as level or level depends largely on its similarity with other items in the marketplace and our ability to obtain corroborative data regarding whether the market in which the instrument trades is active 
investment securities  available for sale investment securities  available for sale  consist of publicly traded equity securities  which are valued using the stock price of the underlying company in which we hold our investment 
our equity securities are classified in level or depending on the level of activity within the market 
investment securities  available for sale that are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy consist of agency discount notes  agency callable notes  agency debt  agency mbs  and non agency mbs 
these assets are carried at fair value on a recurring basis 
the fair values of these securities are determined using quoted prices from external market participants  including pricing services 
if quoted prices are not available  the fair values are determined using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent pricing models  which utilize observable market data such as benchmark yields  reported trades and issuer spreads 
these securities are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
derivative assets and liabilities derivatives are carried at fair value on a recurring basis and primarily relate to our interest rate swaps  caps  floors  basis swaps and forward exchange contracts 
our derivatives are principally traded in over the counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available 
instead  derivatives are measured using market observable inputs such as interest rate yield curves  volatilities and basis spreads 
we also consider counterparty credit risk in valuing our derivatives 
we typically classify our derivatives in level of the fair value hierarchy 
fair values of level financial instruments when observable market prices and data do not exist  significant management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in those cases  small changes in assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation 
due to the unavailability of observable inputs for our level assets  management assumptions used in the valuation models play a significant role in these fair value estimates 
in times of severe market volatility and illiquidity  there may be more uncertainty and variability with lack of market data to use in the valuation process 
an illiquid market is one in which little or no observable activity has occurred or one that lacks willing buyers 
to factor in market illiquidity  management makes adjustments to certain inputs in the valuation models and makes other assumptions to ensure fair values are reasonable and reflect current market conditions 
loans held for investment fair value adjustments are recorded on our loans held for investment on a nonrecurring basis when we have determined that it is necessary to record a specific reserve against the loans by utilizing the fair value of collateral  less costs to sell  to measure the specific reserve for those loans that are collateral dependent 
to determine the fair value of the collateral  we may employ different approaches depending on the type of collateral 
typically  we determine the fair value of the collateral using internally developed models  which require significant management judgment 
the primary inputs of the valuation models vary based on the nature of the collateral and may include expected cash flows  recovery rates  performance multiples and risk premiums based on changing market conditions 
our models utilize industry valuation benchmarks  such as multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  depending on the industry  to determine a value for the underlying enterprise 
valuations consider comparable market transactions where available 
in certain cases where our collateral is a fixed or other tangible asset  we will periodically obtain a third party appraisal to corroborate management s estimates of fair value 
when deemed necessary  we apply an additional liquidity discount to the valuation model to reflect current market conditions 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million related to our loans held for investment measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these losses were attributable to an increased number of loans requiring a specific reserve during the year  as well as declines in the fair value of collateral for these loans 
available for sale investments investment securities  available for sale that are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy include a tranches in an unrelated collateralized loan obligation and corporate debt securities which consist primarily of corporate bonds whose values are determined using internally developed valuation models 
these models may utilize discounted cash flow techniques for which key inputs include the timing and amount of future cash flows and market yields 
market yields are based on comparisons to other instruments for which market data is available 
these models may also utilize industry valuation benchmarks  such as multiples of ebitda  depending on the industry  to determine a value for the underlying enterprise 
given the lack of active and observable trading in the market  our corporate debt securities and tranches in an unrelated collateralized loan obligation are classified in level significant unobservable inputs related to these investment securities include estimates of credit default  recovery and prepayment rates as well as assumptions surrounding the comparability to other investments for which observable price and spread data is available 
valuations may also be adjusted to reflect the illiquidity of the investment 
such adjustments are based on market available evidence and management s best estimates 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million related to other than temporary declines in the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale 
we evaluate these investments for impairment by considering  among other factors  the length of time and extent to which the market value has been below its cost basis 
during  as a result of the current economic environment  the large majority of our unrealized losses on these debt securities were recognized in earnings as other than temporary impairment 
for investments that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired as of december   at least a portion of the impairment recognized was attributable to deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer 
equity investments investments accounted for under the cost or equity methods of accounting are carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to the extent that they are impaired during the period 
we impair these investments to fair value when we have determined that other than temporary impairment exists 
as there is rarely an observable price or market for such investments  we determine fair value using internally developed models 
our models utilize industry valuation benchmarks  such as multiples of ebitda  depending on the industry  to determine a value for the underlying enterprise 
we reduce this value by the value of debt outstanding to arrive at an estimated equity value of the enterprise 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private equity valuation 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
the primary inputs utilized in our valuation models include borrower financial information  transaction multiples and liquidity discounts 
transaction multiples are based on observable market transactions  when available  or similar transactions for comparable companies 
in determining the appropriate multiple to use  we typically review a range of comparable multiples and consider the amount of time elapsed since the transaction occurred  the similarity of the investment transacted to our investment and the similarity of comparable public companies to our investment 
in cases where no comparable transactions are available  we use a comparable multiple within the respective company s industry classification determined by standard poor s 
when deemed necessary  we apply an additional liquidity discount to the valuation model 
in certain cases  liquidity discounts are already embedded into the transaction multiple so no additional discount is applied 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million and million related to other than temporary declines in the fair value of our equity investments accounted for under the cost and equity method of accounting  respectively 
we evaluate these investments for impairment by considering  among other factors  the length of time and extent to which the market value has been below its cost basis 
during  as a result of the current economic environment  the majority of our unrealized losses on these investments were recognized in earnings as other than temporary impairment 
critical accounting estimates accounting policies are integral to understanding our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions based on information that is available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of such statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and our critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions and judgments about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period  or if changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have established detailed policies and procedures to ensure that the assumptions and judgments surrounding these areas are adequately controlled  independently reviewed and consistently applied from period to period 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure related to these estimates 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management performs detailed reviews of the portfolio quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting loan losses 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses  while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowance 
the commercial loan portfolio includes balances with non homogeneous exposures 
these loans are evaluated individually  and are risk rated based upon borrower  collateral and industry specific information that management believes is relevant to determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
loans are then segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
higher risk loans are individually analyzed for impairment 
management establishes specific allowances for loans determined to be individually impaired 
all impaired loans are valued to determine if a specific allowance is warranted 
the valuation analysis for the specific allowance is based upon one of the three valuation methods i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s initially contracted effective yield  ii the loan s observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral 
the appropriate valuation methodology generally reflects the chosen loan resolution strategy being pursued to maximize the loan recovery 
estimated costs to sell are considered in the impairment valuation when such costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan 
any guarantees provided by the borrower are typically not considered when determining our potential for specific loss 
in addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans  we maintain allowances that are based on an evaluation of inherent losses in our commercial loan portfolio 
these allowances are based on an analysis of historical loss experience  current economic conditions and performance trends and any other pertinent information within specific portfolio segments 
certain considerations are made in relation to the length and severity of outstanding balances 
as set forth in detail below  the process for determining the reserve factors and the related level of loan loss reserves is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions that require judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and  therefore  net income 
within this process  management is required to make judgments related  but not limited  to i risk ratings for loans  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii loss rates used for commercial loans  and iv adjustments made to assess certain  including overall credit and economic conditions 
our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and to corresponding reserve factors that we use to estimate the allowance and that are reflective of historical losses 
we assign reserve factors to the loans in our portfolio  which dictate the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
we review the loan portfolio information regularly to determine whether it is necessary for us to further revise our reserve factors 
the reserve factors used in the calculation are determined by analyzing the following elements the types of loans  for example  land  commercial real estate  healthcare receivables or cash flow  our historical losses with regard to the loan types  borrower industry  the relative seniority of our security interest  our expected losses with regard to the loan types  and the internal credit rating assigned to the loans 
we update these reserve factors periodically to capture actual and recent behavioral characteristics of the portfolios 
we estimate the allowance by applying historical loss factors derived from loss tracking mechanisms associated with actual portfolio activity over a specified period of time 
these estimates are adjusted when necessary based on additional analysis of long term average loss experience  external loan loss data and other risks identified from current and expected credit market conditions and trends  including management s judgment for estimate inaccuracy and uncertainty 
we also consider the need for qualitative factors which we use to provide for uncertainties surrounding our estimation process including changes in the volume of our problem loans  changes in the value of collateral for our collateral dependent loans  and the existence of certain loan concentrations 
the sensitivity of our allowance for loan losses to potential changes in our reserve factors in terms of percentage applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december   was as follows estimated increase decrease in the change in reserve factors allowance for loan losses in thousands these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration  or improvement  in risk ratings  but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the reserve factors currently in use are appropriate 
the process of determining the level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
if our internal credit ratings  reserve factors or specific reserves for impaired loans are not accurate  our allowance for loan losses may be misstated 
in addition  our operating results are sensitive to changes in the reserve factors utilized to determine our related provision for loan losses 
we also consider whether losses might be incurred in connection with unfunded commitments to lend although  in making this assessment  we exclude from consideration those commitments for which funding is subject to our approval based on the adequacy of underlying collateral that is required to be presented by a borrower or other terms and conditions

fair value measurements the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy prioritizes observable data from active markets  placing measurements using those inputs in level of the fair value hierarchy  and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs and classifies these as level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date  level valuations based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable in the market either directly or indirectly  level valuations based on models that use inputs that are unobservable in the market and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
an asset or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
fair value hierarchy classifications are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
changes related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification between hierarchy levels 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measurement 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  management s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
for additional information  see note  fair value measurements  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  it is our policy to maximize the use of observable market based inputs  when appropriate  to value our assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis or to determine whether an adjustment to fair value is needed for assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a non recurring basis 
given the nature of some of our assets carried at fair value  whether on a recurring or nonrecurring basis  clearly determinable market based valuation inputs are often not available 
therefore  these instruments are valued using internal assumptions and classified as level we may be required to apply significant judgments in determining our fair value estimates for these assets 
the estimates of fair values reflect our best judgments regarding the appropriate valuation methods and assumptions that market participants would use in determining fair value 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability is affected by a number of factors  such as the type of instrument  the liquidity of the markets for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
judgments in these cases include  but are not limited to selection of third party market data sources  evaluation of the expected reliability of the estimate  reliability  timeliness and cost of alternative valuation methodologies  and selection of proxy instruments  as necessary 
due to the lack of observability of significant inputs  we must make assumptions in deriving our valuation inputs based on relevant empirical data surrounding interest rates  asset prices  timing of future cash flows and credit performance 
in addition  assumptions must be made to reflect constraints on liquidity  counterparty credit quality and other unobservable factors 
imprecision surrounding our assumptions related to unobservable market inputs may impact the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
furthermore  use of different methods to derive the fair value of our assets and liabilities could result in different fair value estimates at the measurement date 
see fair value measurements above for additional discussion surrounding the specific methods and assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  its states and municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we provide for income taxes as a c corporation on income earned from operations 
currently  our subsidiaries cannot participate in the filing of a consolidated federal tax return 
as a result  certain subsidiaries may have taxable income that cannot be offset by taxable losses or loss carryforwards of other entities 
we are subject to federal  foreign  state and local taxation in various jurisdictions 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the change 
from through  we operated as a reit 
effective january   we revoked our reit election and recognized the deferred tax effects in our audited consolidated financial statements as of december  during the period we operated as a reit  we were generally not subject to federal income tax at the reit level on our net taxable income distributed to shareholders  but we were subject to federal corporate level tax on the net taxable income of our taxable reit subsidiaries  and we were subject to taxation in various foreign  state and local jurisdictions 
in addition  we were required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders and meet various other requirements imposed by the internal revenue code  through actual operating results  asset holdings  distribution levels  and diversity of stock ownership 
periodic reviews of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets are made to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all evidence  both positive and negative  is evaluated when making this determination 
items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid  the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies  historical financial performance  expectations of future earnings and the length of statutory carryforward periods 
significant judgment is required in assessing future earning trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences 
in  we established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets for subsidiaries where we determined that there was significant negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize such assets 
negative evidence we considered in making this determination included the incurrence of operating losses at several of our subsidiaries  and uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the deferred tax assets at future points in time 
as of december   the total valuation allowance was million 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining recognized net deferred tax assets of million as of december  will be realized 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reduction or reversal 
as of december   we recorded no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes that can be utilized to offset future taxable income 
if we were to experience a change of control as defined in section of the internal revenue code  more specifically  if we were to undergo a change in ownership of more than of our capital stock over a three year period as measured under section of the internal revenue code  our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  certain built in losses and other tax attributes recognized in years after the ownership change would be limited 
the annual limit would equal the product of a the applicable long term tax exempt rate and b the value of the relevant taxable entity s capital stock immediately before the ownership change 
these change of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of a company s outstanding stock  including certain public groups as set forth under section of the internal revenue code  and those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions 
the determination of whether an ownership change occurs is complex and not entirely within our control 
no assurance can be given as to whether we have undergone  or in the future will undergo  an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million of income tax expense and million of income tax benefit  respectively  with respect to our income from continuing operations 
the effective income tax rate for these periods was and  respectively 
we file income tax returns with the united states and various state  local and foreign jurisdictions and generally remain subject to examinations by these tax jurisdictions for tax years through in  we settled an internal revenue service examination for the tax years and and concluded certain state examinations in and of tax years  and we incurred penalty and interest expense of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  we paid taxes in connection with the settlement and conclusion of these examinations of million and million in and  respectively 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for the tax years to  and certain states for the tax years and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  which are discussed in detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the market risk management section 
in addition  for a detailed discussion of our derivatives  see note  derivative instruments and note  credit risk  in an accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  management report on internal controls over financial reporting the management of capitalsource inc capitalsource is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
capitalsource s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to capitalsource s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations 
therefore  even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 
capitalsource s management assessed the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 
based on such assessment management believes that  as of december   the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 
capitalsource s independent registered public accounting firm  ernst young llp  has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
this report appears on page report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting the board of directors and shareholders of capitalsource inc we have audited capitalsource inc s capitalsource internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria 
capitalsource s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting  and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management report on internal controls over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  capitalsource inc maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the coso criteria 
we also have audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the consolidated balance sheets of capitalsource inc as of december  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  and our report dated march  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon
