application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and service revenues and are recognized in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided fees are fixed and determinable  a customer purchase order is obtained when applicable  and collection is probable 
revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized when the product is sold through to the end customer unless an established return history supports recognizing revenue upon shipment  less a provision for estimated sales returns 
sales tax collected from customers and remitted to the applicable taxing authorities is accounted for on a net basis  with no impact to revenues 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue consists primarily of service revenue not yet performed 
warranty reserve the company offers to its customers a limited warranty that its products will be free from defect in the materials and workmanship for a specified period 
the company has established a warranty reserve  as a component of accrued liabilities  for any potential claims 
the company estimates its warranty reserve based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
changes in claim rates and differences between actual and expected warranty costs could impact the warranty reserve estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company records accounts receivable at their net realizable value and management is required to estimate the collectability of the company s trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
management evaluates all accounts periodically and a reserve is established based on the best facts available to management 
this reserve is also partially determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories based on historical results and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for returns the company estimates its allowance for returns based upon expected return rates 
the estimates of expected return rates are generally a factor of historical returns 
changes in return rates could impact allowance for return estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market involves an inherent level of risk and uncertainty due to technology trends in the industry and customer demand for our products 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand decreases due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
the company has experienced significant changes in required reserves in the past due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in this estimate may occur in the future as market conditions change 
long lived assets property and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
all impairments are recognized in operating results when a permanent reduction in value occurs 
fair value of financial instruments the company s financial instruments and marketable securities are accounted for in accordance with asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc topic defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc topic defines fair value as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
tax assessments the company is periodically engaged in various tax audits by federal  state and foreign governmental authorities incidental to its business activities 
the company records reserves for its estimated probable losses of these proceedings  if applicable 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the guidance of asc topic  accounting for income taxes 
the company considers recent historical losses  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
management is required to make a continuous assessment as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes the impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return in the financial statements at the amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not of being sustained 
consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenues cost of sales gross margin research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charge loss from operations interest income  net other loss income  net loss before income tax income tax benefit net loss overview in most major economies throughout the world  deployment of new telecommunications equipment and services retreated in and this was reflected in our financial results 
asia has been a notable exception to this trend 
china in particular showed a solid pattern of equipment deployment throughout the year 
to date  however  much of the equipment deployment has been supplied by chinese equipment producers at very aggressive prices 
chinese suppliers are using their low cost engineering and production as a competitive weapon to combat foreign equipment providers from gaining any meaningful share of these large deployments  and as a result our customers have not been very successful in combating this strategy and getting additional share in this thriving geographic market 
pricing is critical in the asian markets because the average revenue per user in these markets is estimated to be only of the average revenue per user in the comparable north american and european markets 
when our customers are awarded new business  they are often required to supply equipment with a very short lead time  thus intensifying the financial and operational pressure on their supply chain 
we have responded to this pressure by examining our processes and looking for ways to shorten our lead time requirements 
we have worked very hard to manage our resources and working capital in an effort to maintain a strong balance sheet through these uncertain times 
the telecom equipment demand picture for remains very difficult to predict 
therefore  in we plan to embark upon a multi tiered strategy to diversify into a number of new business opportunities and also diversify our customer base for existing products and services 
specifically  we have begun to target engineering design services and contract manufacturing opportunities to take full advantage of our competitive core skill sets already in place 
at the same time  we plan to feature a number of new innovative solutions that we believe will expand our presence within the traditional telecom sector  but potentially open up new market segments with the broader communications marketplace 
results of operations revenues total revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
revenues decreased slightly in compared to this decrease was primarily driven by two factors 
during we received a one time cancellation fee of  which was included in other revenue for unique customer requirements for product development work that was discontinued 
there was no similar fee earned in in addition  our broadband telecom revenues decreased by approximately to million in compared to million in  primarily as the result of reduced deployments of new telecommunications equipment by our customers 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in our professional services revenues to approximately million in compared to approximately  in all other revenues  excluding the one time cancellation fee described above  comprised primarily of enterprise products  storage products and support services  remained flat at million in and revenues decreased by in compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to our broadband telecom revenues which decreased by to million in from million in the global economic slowdown had an impact on our customers and resulted in a significant telecommunications market slowdown 
in addition  as expected  our enterprise product line revenues decreased by to  for compared to million in all other revenues  comprised primarily of professional services  cancellation charges and storage products  increased to million in compared to million in we had a one time cancellation fee of included in other revenue during for unique customer requirements for product development work that was discontinued 
there were no similar fees earned in gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to is primarily due to three factors 
there was a positive impact on the gross margin percentage due to the  project cancellation fee recorded in the first quarter of that had no cost of sales associated with it  while there was no similar charge in in addition  gross margin in was negatively impacted by an increase of  in excess and obsolete inventory charges during compared to finally  gross margin in was negatively impacted further by product mix as we continued to see an increase in purchases of our lower margin products within our broadband telecom product portfolio 
we believe that pricing pressures in the industry may continue to dampen our gross margin percentage in future periods and it may continue to be challenging to offset these pressures with incremental supplier cost reductions and factory productivity improvements 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to is primarily driven by product mix as we saw an increase in purchases of our lower margin products within our broadband telecom product portfolio 
also  contributing to the decrease in our gross margin percentage was a decrease in factory utilization in compared to the negative factors to our gross margin were partially offset by a reduction in excess and obsolete inventory charges  as we recorded  in excess and obsolete inventory charges for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  approximately of the excess and obsolete inventory charges was the result of stranded inventory related to a future project  cancelled by nortel networks in connection with their reorganization under chapter in late january the cancelled project was treated as a subsequent event in and thus the excess and obsolete inventory charges were included in our consolidated financial statements as cost of goods sold

the decrease is primarily due to three factors 
we reduced our project related headcount expense by approximately  in compared to we experienced reduced headcount and facility expense of approximately  year over year as a result of the restructuring plan we undertook in the first quarter of see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
much of our research and development resources are located in france and as such those costs are subject to exchange rate fluctuations with the euro and the dollar 
the dollar was stronger against the euro in compared to this exchange rate fluctuation resulted in a decrease to research and development expense of approximately  we anticipate that spending on research and development will decrease in the near future as a result of the restructuring plan we undertook in the fourth quarter of  subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we will continue to take steps  when appropriate  to attempt to mitigate the impact of currency exposure by strategically acquiring foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a specific date in the future at a predetermined rate established by contract see item a foreign currency risk 
in addition to our foreign exchange contracts  our total cost of performing research and development activities in france is reduced by the effect of a research and development tax credit offered by the french tax administration 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue is due to research and development expense decreasing at a higher rate than revenue 
we will continue to monitor the level of our investments in research and development concurrently with actual revenue results

sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately  in compared to the increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily driven by two factors 
in late  we made strategic headcount investments in the areas of business development and marketing  which increased sales and marketing expense for by approximately  also  during  we saw an increased utilization of outside sales representation and consulting services which resulted in additional expense of approximately  in compared to the dollar was stronger against the euro in compared to this exchange rate fluctuation resulted in a decrease to sales and marketing expense of approximately  the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue is due to revenue decreasing while sales and marketing expenses increased 
sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately  in compared to the decrease in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to the restructuring plan we undertook in the first quarter of see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the reduced headcount expense resulted in a decrease in sales and marketing expense of approximately  additionally  we saw a decrease in variable sales compensation of approximately  due to the decrease in revenue in compared to the reductions were partially offset by approximately  as a result of the stronger euro against the dollar in compared to the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue is due to revenue decreasing at a higher rate than sales and marketing expenses

restructuring charge on december   we adopted a plan to restructure our worldwide operations 
the primary goal of the restructuring program is to align our current spending with recent revenue trends and to enable additional investments in strategic growth areas 
under the restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce by positions 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million classified as an operating expense in the fourth quarter of of which approximately million will result in cash expenditures to cover employee severance and benefits 
the remaining  included in the restructuring charge related to certain non cash impairment charges see note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information

changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time and result in trends in cash flows from operating activities generally reflecting earnings trends

our significant long term obligations are operating leases on facilities and future debt payments 
we have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations and payment commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt obligation  operating lease obligations  total at december   we had borrowings of million under a million revolving credit facility with a bank 
the revolving credit facility matures on december  and is secured throughout the term of the credit facility by marketable securities 
we incur interest expense on the borrowings from the revolving credit facility at a rate of libor plus to applicable margin rate based on certain factors included in our credit agreement 
at december   our interest rate on the borrowings from the revolving credit facility was 
we used the rate to estimate interest expense for through december the interest expense estimate is  annually for the years through december we lease our facilities under non cancelable operating leases with the longest terms extending to march our operating lease at our headquarters location includes a  letter of credit issued to our landlord which can only be used in the case of non payment of such lease 
the letter of credit  if accessed  would be funded by our existing revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements in an attempt to mitigate foreign currency risk  we may enter into  from time to time  foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a fixed date in the future at a fixed rate determined at the contract date 
at december  and  we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
other management believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures and debt services 
to the extent that our actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asc b  participating securities and the two class method 
asc b states that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and therefore are to be included in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation 
our adoption of asc b required the weighted average of our unvested restricted stock awards to be included in the company s calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
all prior period earnings per share data presented are to be adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of asc b 
we were subject to the provisions of asc b beginning january  in may  the fasb issued an accounting standard update asu for asc topic  subsequent events 
asc as updated sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity must evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity is required to make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the company adopted the new asu as of june   which was the required effective date 
we are not aware of any subsequent events which would require recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  to amend certain guidance in fasb asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the amended guidance in asc modifies the separation criteria by eliminating the criterion that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items and eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation 
instead  the amended guidance requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the amended guidance in asc is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early application and retrospective application permitted 
we expect to prospectively apply the amended guidance in asc beginning january  our adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business on a global basis and  in some cases  in foreign currencies 
the company s operations in france are transacted in the local currency and converted into us dollars based on published exchange rates for the periods reported and are therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the euro to us dollar translation accounted for charges of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in an attempt to mitigate the risk described above  we may enter into  from time to time  foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a fixed date in the future at a fixed rate determined at the contract date 
these derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging  and therefore any change in the market value of these contracts resulting in a gain or loss is recognized as other loss income  net in the period of the change 
we held no foreign exchange contracts at any point during the year ended december   and thus there was no related gain or loss 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized a gain of  and  respectively related to these foreign exchange contracts 
at december  and  there were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
market price risk we had no equity hedge contracts outstanding as of december   or interest rate risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of interest earning financial instruments  including bank time deposits  money market funds  and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national governmental entities and agencies 
due to the demand nature of our money market funds and the short term nature of our time deposits and debt securities portfolio  these assets are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we manage this risk through investments with shorter term maturities and varying maturity dates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate decrease of less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our marketable securities at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate decrease of less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  we maintain a million revolving bank credit facility maturing december  with an applicable interest rate on any outstanding balances under the credit facility based on london interbank offered rate libor plus to applicable margin rate based on certain factors included in our credit 
the interest rate on the borrowings under the revolving credit facility was and at december  and  respectively 
the unused portion of the credit facility is subject to an unused facility fee ranging from 
to 
depending on total deposits with the creditor 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would increase annual interest expense on this credit facility by approximately  all borrowings under this facility are secured by marketable securities
