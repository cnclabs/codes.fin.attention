item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business redwood is a financial institution focused on investing in  financing  and managing residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
our primary source of income consists of interest we earn from our real estate investments less the expenses we incur on our borrowed funds and other liabilities 
our real estate investments primarily include investments in residential and commercial loans and securities  an investment in a private fund that we sponsor redwood opportunity fund  lp the fund and investments in the securitization entities that we sponsor sequoia entities and acacia entities which we may collectively refer to as sequoia and acacia  respectively 
for financial reporting purposes  we are generally required to consolidate these entities assets  liabilities  and any noncontrolling interests 
we also have investment exposure to real estate related credit risk through investments in financial instruments other than loans and securities 
a long term focus of ours is to invest in mortgage backed securities that have concentrated structural credit risk 
we refer to these securities as subordinate securities as they are generally the first securities to incur credit losses within a securitization structure 
more recently  we have been actively investing in senior mortgage backed securities  which have less concentrated credit risk and are generally the first securities to receive cash flows within a securitization structure 
the fund and securitization entities that we sponsor also invest in real estate assets 
assets held at the fund include senior securities backed by non prime residential and collateralized debt obligations cdo collateral  which were funded through the sale of limited partnership interests to us and to third party investors 
the offer and sale of these interests were privately placed and were not registered under the federal securities laws in reliance on an exemption from registration 
assets held at the sequoia entities primarily include residential real estate loans  which are funded through the issuance of abs to us and to third party investors 
assets held at the acacia entities primarily include real estate securities  and some loans and other mortgage related investments  which are funded through the issuance of abs and equity to us and to third party investors 
we assume a range of risks when investing and the level of risk is influenced by the manner in which we finance our purchases of  and derive income from  our investments 
our investments in senior and subordinate securities are financed with equity and long term debt  although we may use short term debt financing to acquire securities and loans or for other purposes from time to time 
our investments in the fund and consolidated securitization entities are financed with equity and long term debt 
our capital at risk is limited to our investment in each entity as they are independent of redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities are not owned by and are not obligations of redwood 
recent developments all in all  we feel reasonably good about our operational and financial performance over the quarter and year ended december  it was a challenging year not only for redwood but also for almost all mortgage industry participants  some of whom did not survive 
in early we were in the midst of a multifaceted economic downturn  the worst since the great depression  and we expressed confidence that our strong balance sheet and other factors would enable us to prosper in that environment and build our franchise in the months and years ahead 
redwood not only survived  but capitalized on excellent investment opportunities that enabled us to increase our book value and earnings  and end the year with good momentum going into we made this happen by completing two successful common stock offerings during a period of great uncertainty earlier in the year 
amidst the panic and fear of systemic collapse  we indicated that we were excited by residential mortgage backed securities rmbs valuations that offered us the chance to make investments in senior residential securities at attractive rates of return 
we were able to invest a substantial amount in these types of investment opportunities early in the year when prices in deeply discounted residential securities were most attractive 
our initial capital raise attracted many competitors to the market  which  combined with unprecedented government intervention into the 
table of contents financial markets to restore liquidity and confidence  drove asset prices substantially higher  particularly in the second half of the year 
looking back  we feel we made the right call  made it early  and took advantage of an investment opportunity that continues to work out well for our shareholders 
we ended in a better financial position than we began  with a stronger balance sheet  more liquidity  no short term recourse debt  and a considerably larger investment portfolio  and well positioned to take advantage of new investment opportunities 
prices for senior rmbs moved up sharply and steadily from march through december contributing factors included a massive shift in liquidity toward fixed income investments  a collapse of risk premiums  and the re introduction of leverage to enhance yields 
senior rmbs prices continued to rally early in driven by steady inflows into bond funds as shown in the following chart 
senior rmbs prices

source jpmorgan chase with rmbs prices elevated and yields generally less attractive  our investment pace has slowed from million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of  and to million in the first quarter through february  while we are long term investors at our core  we have taken the rally in prices as an opportunity to cull through our portfolio to sell certain securities 
in fact  we sold million of rmbs in the fourth quarter and million in the first quarter through february  all first quarter sales were at prices above our year end marks 
we are acutely aware that we need to put our excess cash to work at appropriate risk and return levels 
however  our approach to investing remains the same 
managing our capital and identifying opportunities is an ongoing process rooted in fundamental analysis of cash flow 
we continue to believe that patience both on your part and ours will ultimately be rewarded 
as we said at the end of the third quarter of  and as we have all observed in recent years  it is far more important to get it right than to do it fast and we have a plan for how to get it right 
in our view  the world of investing is still a dangerous place and our mortgage capital markets professionals as capable and experienced as any in the business are well positioned to capitalize on market moving events as they arise 
residential sector as the us economy exits the great recession  there is much uncertainty about the potential pace of expansion 
the economy appears to have benefited more in the past few quarters from inventory accumulation and government stimulus than from other more sustainable contributors to growth 
concerns about future growth stem partly from the risk of higher rates when the federal reserve ends its rate policy and the soaring us budget deficit  which is now projected to be trillion  or of gross domestic product  for fiscal 
table of contents the expected end of the federal reserve s agency mbs purchase program could reverse recent gains in home affordability by pushing mortgage rates higher 
many are speculating that mortgage rates could rise by to basis points in also  the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at  with few economists projecting material improvement this year 
the prospect of lingering high unemployment remains a concern for housing as the unemployed  underemployed  and those worried about becoming unemployed will be less inclined to buy a house 
and  as is all too painfully obvious  high unemployment continues to fuel record defaults and foreclosures 
perhaps the most disturbing challenge facing housing is the enormous backlog of unsold homes including those explicitly listed for sale and those not listed but waiting in the shadows 
this shadow inventory is fueled by lenders who are delaying the listing of foreclosed properties to avoid significant further write downs  as well as homeowners trying to hang on until a recovery takes hold 
we believe that excess housing supply is prolonging the instability in home prices 
fannie mae and freddie mac remain in conservatorship  with no blueprints for their future and no clear exit strategy for the government 
to date  taxpayers have injected about billion into these companies and the treasury department has committed unlimited financial support for the next three years 
because they are no longer viable businesses  fannie mae and freddie mac have become tools for implementing the government s goal of supporting housing and helping three to four million homeowners avoid foreclosure by refinancing high loan to value mortgages and implementing loan modifications 
the federal housing administration fha is another instrument of the government that is focused on keeping housing affordable  but it is operating below its required minimum capital level and may ultimately need direct support from the treasury department 
combined  these three entities are currently supporting over of the trillion mortgage market and have on and off balance sheet obligations of over trillion  which is staggering  particularly when compared to the trillion national debt 
the current path for fannie mae  freddie mac  and the fha is clearly not sustainable over the long run 
reform is inevitable  it is just a question of when 
unfortunately  our best guess is that this issue will not be addressed until at least  as health care and financial regulatory reform remain on center stage in if there is anything encouraging to be taken away from this  it is that when we meet with many of the key folks in washington who are grappling with this situation  they resoundingly agree that the government needs private market participants to step up  and that is exactly what we are working to do 
after being frozen shut  there is progress with re starting the private residential mortgage securitization market 
private mortgage securitization still makes monumental financial sense  as banks and taxpayers need relief from the massive burden of financing nearly all of the loans in america 
private institutional investors such as mutual funds with trillions of dollars are ready to provide funding for housing 
securitization will bring their money to the table as the majority of institutional investors are required to invest in mortgage securities and not whole loans 
to that end  major banks  aaa investors  the credit rating agencies  the government  industry groups and  of course  redwood are motivated and taking action to make private securitization a reality 
we have been working with institutional investors to restore their confidence in the securitization process  with a special focus on the private capital providers that invest in aaa rated rmbs 
these buyers typically fund or more of a residential loan and thus drive the math that makes securitization work as a financing vehicle 
not surprisingly  the process has centered on the basic fundamentals it starts with high quality prime jumbo loans based on sound underwriting and with meaningful borrower down payments  transparency in disclosures  appropriate credit subordination levels  and enforceable representations and warranties 
to that end  we were engaged throughout and continue to be actively involved in various discussions with policy makers and regulators to improve the mortgage securitization process in ways that rebuild investor confidence and attract private capital 
for example  there is a critical need to separate origination risk the risk that a loan is not what it is represented to be from credit risk 
redwood s business model is to invest in and manage credit risk  so we and other private investors want protection from origination risk as we re enter the market 
we are also working closely with credit rating agencies to model a safer and more straightforward securitization structure that will promote investor and public confidence in a time of higher scrutiny and uncertainty 

table of contents if the credit markets remain stable  our best guess is that securitizations may return during the first half of  although it will take longer for a sustainable securitization market to develop 
but we are not over the finish line yet 
for securitization to return  a few hurdles still remain 
first  some further tightening of aaa credit spreads is necessary 
it will be problematic if volatility and uncertainty creep back into the fixed income markets and aaa credit spreads widen 
second  the rating agencies are still working out the kinks in their revised processes for establishing subordination levels and evaluating originators 
it would also be problematic if rating agency subordination levels come out so high that they would render a securitization uneconomic 
third  the definition of skin in the game ie  how much risk must be retained by loan originators or securitization sponsors needs to be set 
currently  there are three proposals emanating from the house  the senate  and the fdic 
we certainly agree with the concept  but not with any of the proposals  as they are fixated on absolute percentages  rather than on ownership requirements proportionate to the risk inherent in the underlying collateral 
commercial sector last quarter we announced new commercial leadership and the expansion of our commercial real estate platform 
over the last quarter we continued to strengthen our internal resources by adding two new managing directors to the team 
the commercial team now includes six investment professionals who have an average of over years of experience in sourcing  originating  and evaluating credit for commercial mortgage investments 
collectively  our commercial group has been responsible for transacting more than billion in commercial mortgage investments over the course of their careers 
the deep experience of our team will serve us well in both sourcing appropriate investments and avoiding unnecessary risks 
looking forward  we expect the commercial sector to face significant challenges for several years but also provide selected opportunities 
there are substantial debt maturities occurring over the next few years and limited capital available from traditional sources to refinance these obligations 
with declining property valuations and more conservative underwriting  a significant funding gap is developing between maturing loan balances and the amount that traditional first mortgage lenders are willing to advance 
this gap is creating opportunities for redwood to invest in junior positions alongside leading insurance companies and banks as we focus on building an origination platform and portfolio of attractive high quality  long term  stabilized subordinate debt and mezzanine investments that are well suited to our balance sheet structure 
what matters most to us is whether commercial valuations  loan underwriting  and structures  reflect our outlook in which case they could offer attractive opportunities to investors like redwood who carefully target their borrowers  properties  and lending partners 
outlook we believe that redwood has built a business that could not only survive the turmoil of through  but also enters well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities 
we start from strength with ample liquidity and a strong balance sheet 
at a time of significant market uncertainty and in anticipation of the eventual return of private residential mortgage securitization  we could not be happier with our competitive position 
we have been hard at work with our business partners over the past several months on initiatives related to our core business of credit enhancing prime jumbo mortgage loans 
in addition  we now have the right team in place in the commercial sector to put capital to work in a highly capital constrained market by investing in loans on attractive properties located in good markets made to high quality borrowers 
we also believe we have the right corporate structure to compete efficiently  while many of our competitors are faced with the likelihood of increased regulation and restrictions on their business activities 
we have the capital  and we believe we have the means  if needed  to access additional capital  to fund investment opportunities as they arise 
further  our business operations are not subject to bank regulations  enabling us to freely execute on a wide range of opportunities 
equally important  these competitive advantages give redwood a seat at the table with potential partners as we pursue investment opportunities going forward 
it may take us a few quarters  but we believe we will find attractive opportunities in our residential and commercial businesses to fully invest our excess cash

the increase was primarily due to higher average balances of residential senior securities held at redwood that were funded with equity 
net interest income after provision and market valuation adjustments was million for the fourth quarter of as compared to a loss of million for the fourth quarter of  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to lower negative market valuation adjustments mva at redwood due to fewer impairment charges on securities and a million decrease in the provision for loan losses at sequoia due to lower balances of residential loans 
operating expenses were million for the fourth quarter of as compared to million for the fourth quarter of  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in headcount and fewer legal and consulting expenses  partially offset by an increase in variable compensation expense 
operating expenses could increase in subsequent periods as we focus on new business development activities 
realized gains  net  were million for the fourth quarter of as compared to million for the fourth quarter of  an increase of million  as ongoing portfolio management activities resulted in a greater number of security sales and related gains 
the results of operations section of this management s discussion and analysis contains a further analysis of the components of net income 

table of contents taxable income and dividends our estimated total taxable loss was million per share for the fourth quarter of as compared to taxable loss of million per share for the fourth quarter of  an increase of million 
our estimated reit taxable loss was million per share for the fourth quarter of as compared to reit taxable loss of million per share for the fourth quarter of  an increase of million 
the increase in the reit taxable loss was primarily due to an increase in realized credit losses on subordinate securities 
realized credit losses for the fourth quarters of and were million and million  or and per share  respectively 
our reit taxable income is that portion of our total taxable income that we earn at redwood and its qualifying reit subsidiaries and determines the minimum amount of dividends we must distribute to shareholders in order to maintain our tax status as a reit 
we paid per share in regular dividends in and announced that these dividends are characterized for tax purposes as a return of capital given our estimated taxable loss at the reit for the tax year 
there was no undistributed reit taxable income at december  on november   our board of directors announced its intention to pay a regular dividend of per share per quarter in depending on the timing of credit losses  we may incur a taxable loss in for tax purposes 
in any case  we currently do not expect to generate sufficient taxable income in to offset our net operating losses 
thus  we expect that any dividends will be characterized as a return of capital and  as such  would not be taxable to shareholders 
differences exist in the accounting for gaap and tax that can lead to a significant variance in the amount and timing of when income and losses are recognized under these two measures and therefore when we may recognize taxable income and be required to distribute income as dividends to shareholders 
reconciliations of gaap and tax income are shown in our results of operations section of management s discussion analysis under the sub heading results of operations estimated taxable loss income 
components of book value the financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis contains a detailed discussion and analysis of the components of gaap book value at december  the following supplemental non gaap components of book value addresses our assets and liabilities as reported under gaap and as estimated by us using fair values for our investments 
we show our investments in the fund  and the sequoia and acacia entities as separate line items to highlight our ownership interests  as the assets and liabilities of these entities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes are legally not ours 
our non gaap estimated economic value is calculated using estimated bid side asset values which take into account available bid side marks and estimated offer side values which take into account available offer side marks for our financial liabilities  as required to determine fair value under gaap 
this method of calculating economic value more closely represents liquidation value and does not represent the higher amount we would have to pay to replace our existing assets or the higher amount we would have to pay to redeem our liabilities

the increase resulted from per share from net cash flows and net positive market valuation adjustments on our securities and investments and long term debt  less per share of cash operating and interest expense and per share of dividends 
non gaap economic value is determined by calculating the fair value of our investments in consolidated entities directly as opposed to deriving their reported gaap values by netting their consolidated assets and liabilities 
in calculating our estimate of non gaap economic value  we also value our long term debt at its estimated fair value rather than its amortized cost basis as reported for gaap 
factors affecting management s estimate of non gaap economic value in reviewing our estimate of non gaap economic value  there are a number of important factors and limitations to consider 
the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity is calculated as of a particular point in time based on our existing assets and liabilities or  in certain cases  our estimate of economic value of our existing assets and liabilities  and does not incorporate other factors that may have a significant impact on that value  most notably the impact of future business activities and cash flows 
as a result  the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity does not necessarily represent an estimate of our net realizable value  liquidation value  or our market value as a whole 
amounts we ultimately realize from the disposition of assets or settlement of liabilities may vary significantly from the estimated economic values of those assets and liabilities 
because temporary changes in market conditions can substantially affect our estimate of the economic value of our stockholders equity  we do not believe that short term fluctuations in the economic value of our assets and liabilities are necessarily representative of the effectiveness of our investment strategy or the long term underlying value of our business 
when quoted market prices or observable market data are not available to estimate fair value  we rely on level inputs 
because assets and liabilities classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  the process of calculating economic value is generally subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of economic value  and the use of different assumptions as well as changes in market conditions could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition

we also sold residential securities with a basis of million and realized gains of million 
we continue to manage our portfolio and may sell additional assets as conditions merit 
principal payments reduced the fair value of our securities by million during the fourth quarter of compared to million in the increase in principal payments primarily reflects the increase in size of our portfolio 
unscheduled prepayments on our securities were generally consistent with recent prior quarters 
we estimate that the change in fair value of our securities due to market price adjustments was an increase of million during the fourth quarter of this increase was primarily due to increased demand for residential senior and re remic securities 
investments in the fund  sequoia and acacia the gaap reported value of our investments in the fund  sequoia entities  and acacia entities totaled million  or of our securities and investments at december  the fair value which equals gaap carrying value of our investment in the fund was million 
the fund is primarily invested in non prime residential securities and is managed by a subsidiary of redwood 
our investment represents a interest in the fund 
the gaap carrying value of our investments in sequoia entities was million and the fair value was million 
the million of economic value consists of million of interest only securities ios and million of senior and subordinate securities  and is calculated using the same valuation process that we follow to fair value our other real estate securities 
these ios earn the spread between the coupon rate on 
table of contents the billion notional amount of underlying adjustable rate mortgage arm loans and the cost of funds indexed to one month libor on the abs issued within each respective securitization entity 
returns on these investments increase when prepayments slow and decrease when prepayments speed up 
the gaap carrying value and fair value of our investments in acacia entities was million 
these investments consist of equity interests and securities in the acacia entities we sponsor  which have minimal value  as well as the value of future management fees we expect to receive from acacia entities  which we discounted at a rate 
capital resources and liquidity throughout  we maintained our strong balance sheet and liquidity 
we ended with total capital of billion  which consists of million of common equity and million of year long term debt due in we had no short term debt at december  we use our capital to invest in earning assets  fund our operations  fund working capital  and meet lender capital requirements with respect to collateralized borrowings  if any 
through our internal risk adjusted capital policy  we allocate capital for our earning assets to meet liquidity needs that may arise 
currently  we have allocated risk capital equal to of the fair value of our investments 
the amount of remaining capital that exceeds our risk adjusted capital guidelines is excess capital that can be invested to support business growth 
excess capital generally equals our cash balance less pending investment settlements and other internal capital allocations we have established for the prudent operations of our company 
our excess capital at december  was million and at february  was million 
given the amount of our excess capital  it seems unlikely we would seek additional capital in the near term 
if circumstances should change  we would likely look first at our own balance sheet for sources of cash before considering other options 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  or per share 
at december   most of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in us treasury bills 
our quarterly sources and uses of our cash is one of the financial metrics on which we focus 
therefore  as a supplement to the consolidated statement of cash flows included in this annual report on form k  we show in the table below i the beginning cash balances at december  and september  which are gaap amounts  ii the ending cash balances at december  and september  which are gaap amounts  and iii the components of sources and uses of cash organized in a manner consistent with the way management analyzes them 
the presentation of our sources and uses of cash for these quarters is derived by aggregating and netting all items within our gaap consolidated statement of cash flows that were attributable to the quarters 
redwood is focused on generating long term investment cash flow 
beginning in the first quarter of  we began discussing the detailed quarterly components of our sources and uses of cash to supplement our other gaap financial statement disclosures 
we knew that a cash analysis of this type had limitations  but felt at the time that non cash mark to market adjustments and the consolidation of securitization entities made it difficult for readers to measure our economic performance solely by reading our gaap income statement 
in recent quarters  the impact of mark to market charges has declined  both by virtue of changes in the mix of our securities portfolio and by the adoption of recent accounting principles  and we believe re emphasizing more gaap income centric performance metrics is appropriate  however  we continue to provide supplemental cash flow information to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
in the fourth quarter  cash flow continued to be strong and in line with our expectations 
our business cash flows exceeded dividend distributions and proceeds from sales generally offset our use of cash for acquisitions 
we had a net inflow of cash and ended the year with million in cash 
the decline in business cash flow from the third to the fourth quarter was due to reduced principal balances on securities held in our portfolio and slightly slower prepayments 
although prepayments slowed this quarter  prepayments on loans underlying our securities were generally faster than we expected at acquisition which  since we bought these securities at discounts  is a positive 
the sources and uses of cash in the table below are derived from our gaap consolidated statement of cash flow for the fourth and third quarters of by aggregating and netting all items in a manner consistent with the way management analyzes them

table of contents fourth quarter cash flow from securities and investments included million of coupon interest and million of principal payments  compared to million of coupon interest and million of principal payments in the third quarter 
we evaluate cash flow performance over the life of an investment 
interim quarter to quarter analysis has limitations and readers should use caution in drawing conclusions from quarterly cash flow data 
in particular  we note cash flow from securities and investments can be volatile from quarter to quarter depending on the level of invested capital  the timing of credit losses  and changes in prepayments and interest rates 
the timing of acquisitions and sales will have an impact on quarterly cash flow 
given the nature of our investments senior and subordinated securities acquired at deep discounts and ios it is difficult to draw conclusions in any one period about what portion of our cash flow represents income and what represents a return of capital 
it is only at the end of an asset s life that we can accurately determine what portion of the cumulative cash received whether principal or interest was income and what was a return of capital 
many of our investments may generate cash flow in a quarter that is not necessarily reflective of the long term economic yield we will earn on the investments 
for example  we acquired re remic support securities at what we believe to be attractive yields  although  due to their terms  these securities are locked out of receiving any principal payments for years 
because of the deferred receipt of principal payments which is modeled into our acquisition assumptions  formulating any conclusions on the value or performance of these securities by looking solely at the quarterly cash flow may not be appropriate

cash flow from many of our subordinate securities can be volatile and in certain cases eg  when the fair values of certain securities are close to zero any interest income earned can result in unusually high reported yields that are not sustainable  and not necessarily meaningful

unrealized gains and otti related to non credit factors totaled million for and million for in the second quarter of  we adopted new accounting guidance for otti 
as part of this adoption  we were required to evaluate million of otti that was previously expensed through our consolidated statements of income loss 
after evaluating this otti  we determined that million  net of tax  was related to non credit factors and million was related to credit factors 
the million was reclassified to accumulated other comprehensive income loss oci  effectively increasing retained earnings and decreasing accumulated comprehensive income loss to result in zero net impact to our reported stockholders equity and minority interest

year ended december  in thousands fixed compensation expense   variable compensation expense   equity compensation expense   severance expense  total compensation expense   systems   office costs   accounting and legal   other operating expenses   total operating expenses   operating expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   a decline of million 
the decline was due to a million decrease in total compensation expense  a million decrease in legal and accounting expenses  and a million decrease in systems and other operating expenses 

table of contents the million decrease in total compensation expense was attributable to decreases in i fixed compensation expense of million  which was primarily attributable to lower headcount throughout as compared to  ii equity compensation expense of million  which was primarily attributable to a lower balance of unrecognized equity compensation cost at the beginning of as compared to the beginning of and the amortization of these costs over and  respectively  and iii severance expense of million  which was primarily attributable to a fewer number of headcount reductions in as compared to these decreases were offset by a million increase in variable compensation expense  which is further discussed below 
our variable compensation expense generally consists of two components company performance bonuses  which are generally determined based on a company performance bonus formula established at the beginning of each year  and individual performance bonuses  which are generally determined based on an employee s achievement of pre established individual goals 
the million increase in variable compensation expense from to  was primarily attributable to the accrual of an aggregate of million in company performance bonuses  as compared to  when the company paid an aggregate of million in company performance bonuses 
in  individual performance bonuses were  in the aggregate  million lower than in  primarily due to lower headcount in than in the company performance bonuses were determined in the context of strong company performance during the year 
during the company reported positive annual net income for the first time since  earning million and resulting in a return on equity of 
in addition  during  the company s book value per share increased by and management s estimate of economic value per share  a non gaap measure of performance  increased by  in each case while the company continued to pay a dividend of per share per quarter 
see table book value above for a description of this non gaap measure and a reconciliation to gaap book value per share 
in addition  during the company successfully executed several other significant business  financial  and operational initiatives  including successfully executing two public offerings of common stock to raise net proceeds of approximately million and generating a substantial return on the investment of those net proceeds 
because the application of  and change in  certain gaap income recognition rules for other than temporary impairments were inconsistent with certain gaap assumptions that underlay the early establishment of the company performance bonus formula  two one time adjustments were made to the formula after the end of as follows first  the formula was adjusted to eliminate the impact of million of losses the company was required to record through its income statement during that reflected the other than temporary impairments of certain securities whose declines in market value occurred during and had previously reduced the company s gaap book value as of december  second  the formula was adjusted to take into account the company s mandatory adoption in april of the fasb s asc asc  formerly financial statement position asc changed the gaap income recognition rules for other than temporary impairments and required a one time adjustment to the company s financial statements 
in applying the company performance bonus formula  the company s income for was adjusted to include million of income that the company will be precluded from recognizing as a result of the mandatory adoption of asc and the resulting one time adjustment to the company s financial statements 
in recognition of the fact that  in the absence of asc  a portion of that million of income would have been recognized over the course of the next several years  the portions of the company performance bonuses paid to the company s four most senior executive officers attributable to the future period effects of asc were paid in the form of deferred stock units 
these deferred stock units were structured to have terms consistent with past compensation related grants  except that i they would have a vesting schedule that was related to the company s current estimate of the future period effects of asc and ii they would be subject to a minimum mandatory holding period of years inclusive of the vesting periods 
in particular  given that of the post effect was estimated to relate to  of those deferred stock units were 
table of contents granted with a one year vesting period  and given that the remaining of the post effect was estimated to relate to periods during and after  the remaining of those deferred stock units were granted with a two year vesting period 
as a result of the vesting and mandatory holding period  the value of the deferred stock units to the recipients will be affected by the future performance of the company over these vesting and mandatory holding periods 
based on the foregoing  the company s four most senior executive officers received the following company performance bonuses 
mr 
george bull  chairman and chief executive officer  received a bonus consisting of a cash payment of million and an award of deferred stock units subject to the vesting terms and mandatory holding period described above with a grant date fair value of million  mr 
martin hughes  president  co chief operating officer  and chief financial officer  received a bonus consisting of a cash payment of  and an award of deferred stock units subject to the vesting terms and mandatory holding period described above with a grant date fair value of million  mr

harold zagunis  chief risk officer  received a bonus consisting of a cash payment of  and an award of deferred stock units subject to the vesting terms and mandatory holding period described above with a grant date fair value of  because a portion of the company performance bonus paid to the company s four most senior executive officers was paid in the form of deferred stock units subject to a vesting period  our accrual for variable compensation expense includes only the aggregate amount of cash bonuses paid in late february the expense associated with the portion of the company performance bonus paid in the form of deferred stock units will be incurred over the vesting periods applicable to those deferred stock units 
legal and accounting expenses decreased by million from to primarily due to the addition of in house legal counsel in late and lower third party accounting costs during systems and other operating expenses also decreased by a combined million from to this decline was largely attributable to a million decrease in non renewed consulting contracts and a million decrease in software expenses from to  as well as a million excise tax paid in

sequoia abs premium amortization includes million of bond issuance premium amortization and negative million of dbic amortization 
net interest income at securitization entities was million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the amount and timing of changes between the income and expense yields on loans and abs issued by sequoia entities 
these changes were largely due to changes in benchmark libor interest rates 
as discussed below  overall interest income and interest expense declined during these periods due to lower average balances of loans  securities  and abs issued at the securitization entities 
analysis of interest income at securitization entities interest income at our securitization entities was million for  as compared to million for  a decline of million 
interest income declined primarily due to lower average balances of loans at consolidated sequoia entities  along with lower benchmark libor interest rates on loans and securities at our securitization entities 
average balances of loans at consolidated sequoia entities decreased due to principal repayments on loans and securities with no offsetting acquisition activity 
during  the interest income on our sequoia ios benefitted from the historically large difference between six month libor which is the index on the majority of the loans underlying our ios and one month libor which is the index on the majority of the debt issued by these entities 
over the past year  this spread has decreased and we do not anticipate having this same benefit to our interest income in future periods 
the average prepayment rate for sequoia loans was during as compared to in average balances of loans at consolidated sequoia entities also decreased due to the deconsolidation of certain sequoia entities during the past twelve months

the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs of million or of outstanding loan balances and million or of outstanding loan balances for and  respectively 
this resulted in an increase of million and million in our allowance for loan losses for and  respectively 
these charge offs were generated by million and million of defaulted loans in and  respectively  for average implied loss severities of for both and as a result of higher provisions  we have substantially increased our allowance for loan losses in both absolute terms and as a percentage of outstanding loan principal 
the allowance for loan losses increased to million or of outstanding loan principal balances at december   from million or of outstanding loan principal balances at december  serious delinquencies on loans held by consolidated sequoia entities  which include all loans delinquent more than days and in foreclosure  increased to million or of residential loan balances at december   from million or at december  these increases reflect the continued economic downturn that has resulted in widespread credit deterioration for residential loans in the united states in general 
credit deterioration in the loan portfolio has been most notable in certain states and more recent loan vintages 
loans originated in california  florida  georgia  ohio  and michigan accounted for a disproportionately large share of seriously delinquent loans held by consolidated sequoia entities at december  loans originated in had the largest increase in serious delinquencies over the past twelve months

analysis of interest expense at redwood the following table details how interest expense at redwood changed as a result of changes in average debt balances volume and interest yields rate 
interest expense decreased primarily because of lower volume due to the paydown of short term debt during benchmark libor interest rates on our long term debt also declined during  which also contributed to the decline in interest expense

potential gaap earnings volatility we expect quarter to quarter gaap earnings volatility from our business activities 
this volatility can occur for a variety of reasons  including the timing and amount of purchases  sales  calls  and repayment of consolidated assets  changes in the fair values of consolidated assets and liabilities  and certain non recurring events 
in addition  the amount of or timing of our reporting earnings volatility may be impacted by technical accounting issues  some of which are described below 
changes in premium amortization for loans at sequoia the unamortized premium for loans owned by sequoia was million at december  the amount of periodic premium amortization expense we recognize is volatile and dependent on a number of factors  including credit performance of the underlying loans  changes in prepayment speeds  and changes in short term interest rates 
loan premium amortization was million in  compared to million in we currently expect loan premium amortization in to be slightly lower than in  although actual changes in interest rates or prepayments may produce a different result than we currently anticipate 

table of contents changes in yields for securities at redwood and the fund the yields we project on real estate securities can have a significant  and potentially volatile  effect on the periodic interest income we recognize for financial reporting purposes 
yields can vary as a function of credit results  prepayment rates  and interest rates 
if estimated future credit losses are less than our prior estimate  credit losses occur later than expected  or prepayment rates are faster than expected meaning the present value of projected cash flows is greater than previously expected for assets acquired at a discount to face value  the yield over the remaining life of the security may be adjusted upwards 
if estimated future credit losses exceed our prior expectations  credit losses occur more quickly than expected  or prepayments occur more slowly than expected meaning the present value of projected cash flows is less than previously expected for assets acquired at a discount to face value  the yield over the remaining life of the security may be adjusted downward 
changes in the actual maturities of real estate securities may also affect their yields to maturity 
actual maturities are affected by the contractual lives of the associated mortgage collateral  periodic payments of principal  and prepayments of principal 
therefore  actual maturities of afs securities are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities 
stated contractual maturities are generally greater than ten years 
we cannot assure that our assumptions used to estimate future cash flows or the current period s yield for each asset will not change in the near term  and the change could be material 
changes in fair values of securities all securities owned at redwood and consolidated entities are classified as either trading or afs securities  and in both cases are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values 
for trading securities  changes in fair values are recorded in the consolidated statements of income loss 
periodic fluctuations in the values of these investments are inherently volatile and thus can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
for afs securities  cumulative unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated statements of equity 
unrealized gains and losses are not charged against current earnings to the extent they are temporary in nature 
certain factors may require us however  to recognize these amounts as other than temporary impairments and record them through our current earnings 
factors that determine other than temporary impairment include a change in our ability or intent to hold assets  adverse changes to projected cash flows of assets  or the likelihood that declines in the fair values of assets would not return to their previous levels within a reasonable time 
impairments can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
as of january   we elected to adopt a new accounting standard  the fair value option  to record the assets and liabilities of consolidated acacia entities and certain other assets at redwood at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of market valuation adjustments  net  in our consolidated statements of income loss 
we may also elect the fair value option for certain new acquisitions in the future 
our elections significantly reduced the disparity that existed between the gaap carrying value of our equity investments in acacia entities and our estimate of their economic value 
however  valuation changes in these financial instruments are inherently volatile and can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments we can experience significant earnings volatility from our use of derivatives 
we generally use derivatives to hedge cash flows on assets and liabilities that have different coupon rates fixed rates versus floating rates  or floating rates based on different indices 
the nature of the instruments we use and the accounting treatment for the specific assets  liabilities  and derivatives may lead to volatile periodic earnings  even when we are meeting our hedging objectives 
all derivatives are currently accounted for as trading instruments and their changes in market values flow through our consolidated statements of income loss 
the assets and liabilities we hedge may not be similarly accounted for as our hedging derivatives eg  they may be reported at cost  or only impairments may be reported through our consolidated statements of income loss 
this could lead to reported income and book values in specific periods that do not necessarily reflect the economics of our hedging strategy 
even when the 
table of contents assets and liabilities are similarly accounted for as trading instruments  periodic changes in their value may not coincide as other market factors eg  supply and demand may affect certain instruments and not others at any given time 
future changes in accounting principles the adoption of new accounting principles could have a significant impact on the amount or timing of our reported gaap earnings 
adoption of new principles of consolidation as of january  as of january   we adopted two new accounting standards that significantly affect the gaap guidance we will follow in future periods to determine if or when we must consolidate transferred financial assets or a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes 
these new standards are statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  fas 
fas and fas were codified in december as asc and asc  respectively 
our financial statements and related disclosures will be prepared in accordance with these new standards beginning with the quarter ended march  fas was issued by the fasb in june fas eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets  and enhances information reported to users of our financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and any continuing involvement we may have in those transferred assets 
concurrent with the release of fas  the fasb issued fas  which amends the consolidation guidance that applies to vies 
the amendments change how we determine when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether we are required to consolidate an entity will be based on  among other things  a vies purpose and design and our ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
fas also enhances information reported to users of our financial statements by providing greater transparency about our involvement with vies  significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement  and any affects our involvement may have on our financial statements 
fas is effective for financial asset transfers beginning on january  as of the date of this filing  we had not completed any new transfers of financial assets 
to the extent we complete a transfer in the future for example  the transfer of loans into a new sequoia securitization entity the provisions of fas will be used to determine whether the transfer is accounted for as a sale under gaap or as a secured borrowing 
as part of our adoption of this new standard  we also determined that the sequoia and acacia entities that we had transferred assets to in the past and consolidated at december   should continue to be consolidated by us as they do not qualify for sale accounting treatment under previously issued fasb statement no 
 based upon our continuing involvement in these entities 
the provisions of fas will also be used to determine when all or a portion of a previously transferred financial asset can be derecognized in the future 
fas became effective for all vies we held as of january   except for the fund  as a result of the fasb s decision to delay the applicability of fas for private equity funds in part due to a concern that application of the standard in its current form might prompt some asset managers to consolidate the funds they manage  leading to less transparency 
therefore  we were not required to reconsider our initial conclusion that we are the primary beneficiary of the fund in accordance with the current gaap guidance formerly fin r 
as part of our adoption of fas  we were required to reconsider our previous conclusions pertaining to consolidation of our variable interests in vies  including i whether an entity is a vie  ii whether we are the vie s primary beneficiary  and  iii what type of financial statement disclosures are required 
in order to assess our existing interests under the new gaap guidance  we compiled a list of potential variable interests owned through december   reviewed the applicable entity documents  such as pooling and servicing agreements  prospectus supplements  offering memoranda  and indentures  and made inquiries of redwood s portfolio managers  third party brokers  and others to confirm our understanding of the deal structures used for this analysis 
the objective of this analysis was to determine i which activities were significant to each 
table of contents vie  ii who held the power to direct activities significant to each vie  and  iii who had the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of each vie that could potentially be significant to that vie 
based upon this analysis  we assessed each vie to determine whether we should or should not consolidate the vie based upon our interpretation of fas to facilitate our analysis  we reassessed the entities that we currently sponsor and consolidate the fund  sequoia entities  and acacia entities 
we also grouped our third party vies into five sub categories based upon ownership interest ie  senior vs 
subordinate  entity type  rights and activities  and control 
these common deal types included i third party senior residential securities  ii third party re remic securities  iii third party subordinate residential securities  iv third party commercial subordinate securities  and v third party cdo securities 
the following table presents a summary of redwood s balance sheet at december   which includes the five vie sub categories for our securities and the number of vies assessed within each sub category  and the number of vies assessed within each of our investments in the fund  sequoia entities  and acacia entities

for our consolidated sequoia securitization entities  we determined that  assuming these entities did not include financial assets transferred by us and we were therefore not subject to the sale accounting criteria outlined in fas  we would not be the primary beneficiary of these vies in accordance with fas  as we do not service any underling loan collateral and do not  based upon our continuing involvement  have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the these entities 
for the acacia entities  we determined that  assuming these entities did not include financial assets transferred by us and we were therefore not subject to the sale accounting criteria outlined in fas  we would be the primary beneficiary of these vies as our asset management responsibilities  equity investments  and call options provide us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these individual entities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that are significant 
finally  we anticipate that we will continue to consolidate the fund once fas becomes effective for this vie  as our asset management responsibilities and significant general and limited partnership 
table of contents interests provide us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the fund and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that are significant 
thus  as a result of our analysis  we do not anticipate any impact to our financial statements upon our initial adoption of fas and fas on january  however  fas requires that for each reporting period we reconsider  based upon changes in the facts and circumstances pertaining to our vies  whether we might become the primary beneficiary 
our assessments may therefore change and could result in a material impact to our financial statements during subsequent reporting periods

table of contents differences between taxable loss income and gaap income loss there are differences in accounting for tax and gaap that can lead to significant timing variances in the recognition of income and losses 
for example  we are not allowed to anticipate credit losses for tax in a similar manner as under gaap 
as a result of these differences in accounting  our taxable income can vary significantly from our gaap income during certain reporting periods

table of contents differences between taxable income and gaap income are largely due to the following  i we cannot establish loss reserves for future anticipated events for tax but can for gaap as realized credit losses are expensed when incurred for tax and these losses are anticipated through lower yields on assets or through loss provisions for gaap  ii the timing  and possibly the amount  of some expenses eg  compensation expenses are different for tax than for gaap  iii since amortization and impairments differ for tax and gaap  the tax and gaap gains and losses on sales may differ  resulting in differences in realized gains on sale  for tax  we net capital gains on sales against any available capital losses  and  iv for tax  we do not consolidate noncontrolling interests or securitization entities as we do under gaap 
potential taxable income volatility we expect quarter to quarter estimated taxable income volatility for a variety of reasons  including the timing of credit losses and prepayments on our investments and the tax accounting for equity awards  as described below 
credit losses on securities and loans at redwood to determine estimated taxable income we are generally not permitted to anticipate  or reserve for  credit losses on investments which are generally purchased at a discount 
for tax purposes  we accrete the entire purchase discount on a security into taxable income over the expected life of the security 
estimated taxable income is reduced when actual credit losses occur 
for gaap purposes  we establish a credit reserve and only accrete a portion of the purchase discount  if any  into income and write down securities that become impaired 
our income recognition is therefore faster for tax as compared to gaap  especially in the early years of owning a security when there are generally few credit losses 
at december   the cumulative difference between the gaap and tax amortized costs basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo subordinate securities excluding our investments in the fund and our securitization entities was million 
the timing of losses which results from loan defaults will cause volatility in our tax results 
during  we realized million of credit losses on securities for tax that we had previously provisioned for under gaap 
realized credit losses were based on our tax basis  which averaged  on securities that incurred principal face losses 
we anticipate an additional million of tax losses on securities  based on our projection of face losses and assuming a similar tax basis as we have recently experienced 
as of december   for gaap we had a designated credit reserve of million on our securities and an allowance for loan losses of million for our consolidated residential and commercial loans 
as we have no credit reserves or allowances for tax  any future credit losses on securities or loans will have a more significant impact on tax earnings than on gaap earnings and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses fluctuates during reporting periods 
we anticipate that tax losses will continue to be a significant factor in  although the quarterly timing of actual losses is difficult to accurately anticipate 
recognition of gain on sale since amortization and impairments on assets differ for gaap and tax  the gaap and tax basis on assets sold may differ  resulting in differences in gains and losses on sale 
thus  although we sold assets in and realized a gain for gaap purposes of million  for tax purposes these sales generated losses of million 
the majority of this difference relates to the sale of commercial assets in october in addition  gains realized for tax may be offset by prior capital losses and  thus  not affect taxable income 
as of december   the reit had million in capital loss carry forwards per share that can be used to offset future capital gains over the next five years 
since our intention is to generally invest in assets for the long term  it is difficult to anticipate when sales may occur and  thus  when or whether we might exhaust these capital loss carry forwards 
income recognition on interest only securities ios at sequoia as part of our investment in sequoia securitization entities  we have retained interest only ios securities at the time they are issued 
our current tax basis in these securities is million 
the return on ios is sensitive to prepayments  and  to the extent prepayments vary quarter over quarter  income from these ios will vary 
typically  fast prepayments reduce yields and slow prepayments increase yields 
we are 
table of contents not permitted to recognize a negative yield under tax accounting rules  so during periods of fast prepayments our periodic premium expense for tax purposes can be relatively low and the tax cost basis for these securities may not be significantly reduced 
in periods prior to  we did experience fast prepayments on these loans 
more recently  prepayments have been slowing  and our tax basis is now below the fair values for these ios 
most of our sequoia securitizations are callable or will become callable over the next two years  although we do not currently anticipate calling any sequoia securitizations in or if we do call a sequoia securitization  the remaining tax basis in the ios is written off  creating an ordinary loss at the call date 
compensation expense at redwood the total tax expense for equity award compensation is dependent upon varying factors such as the timing of payments of dividend equivalent rights  the exercise of stock options  the distribution of deferred stock units  and the deferrals to and withdrawals from our executive deferred compensation plan 
for gaap  the total expense associated with an equity award is determined at the award date and is recognized over the vesting period 
for tax  the total expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise  not the award date 
in addition  some compensation may not be deductible for tax if it exceeds certain levels and is not performance based 
thus  the total amount of compensation expense  as well as the timing  could be significantly different for tax than for gaap 
in addition  since the decision to exercise options or have dsu s distribute is an employee s  it can be difficult to project when the tax expense will occur 
should there be significant activity in this regard in any one reporting period  our taxable income could be volatile 
financial condition the majority of the assets shown on our consolidated balance sheets are owned by our securitization entities 
the earning assets of these entities represent of our consolidated earning assets and the liabilities abs issued of these entities represent of our consolidated liabilities 
although we consolidate these assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  they are bankruptcy remote from us 
that is  they are structured so that our liabilities are not liabilities of the securitization entities and the abs issued by the securitization entities are not obligations of ours

senior securities are those interests in a securitization that have the first right to cash flows and are last in line to absorb losses 
re remic securities  as presented herein  were created through the resecuritization of certain senior interests to provide additional credit support to those interests 
re remic securities are therefore subordinate to the remaining senior interest  but senior to any subordinate tranches of the securitization from which they were created 
subordinate securities generally rated aa and lower at issuance are all interests below senior and re remic interests 
the commercial and cdo securities that we own are generally subordinate securities

table of contents residential securities prime securities are residential mortgage backed securities backed by high credit quality loans 
many of these loans are jumbo loans  with loan balances greater than existing conforming loan limits 
prime securities typically have relatively high weighted average fico scores or higher  low weighted average loan to value ratios ltv or less  and limited concentrations of investor properties 
regardless of whether or not the loans backing a mortgage backed security are of high credit quality  there is credit risk that the borrower may not be able to repay the loan 
non prime securities are residential mortgage backed securities that are generally backed by lower credit quality loans 
most of the borrowers backing non prime loans have lower fico scores or impaired credit histories  but exhibit the ability to repay the loan 
to compensate for the greater risks and higher costs to service non prime loans  borrowers often pay higher interest rates  and possibly higher origination fees 
we use loss assumptions that are significantly higher when acquiring securities backed by non prime loans than we use when acquiring securities backed by prime loans

the majority of the loans underlying our securities are within the agency conforming loan limit the current conforming loan limits for the federal housing administration  fannie mae  and freddie mac 
these limits vary by county and are as high as  in high cost areas 
the table above also provides the weighted average coupon rates for the respective vintage categories 
as of the beginning of february  the current fixed mortgage rate for a conforming agency loan was approximately 
as mortgage rates decline  the ability of borrowers to refinance and the attractiveness of financing increases  although mortgage rates are only one of the factors affecting refinancing 
the loans underlying all of our residential subordinate securities totaled billion at december   consisting of billion prime and billion non prime 
these loans are located nationwide with a large concentration in california 
during  realized losses on our residential subordinate securities reduced our credit reserve by million 
serious delinquencies days  in foreclosure or reo at december  were of current balances 
these delinquencies were of current balances for loans in prime pools and of current balances for loans in non prime pools 
some of the underlying factors impacting the performance of our residential securities include housing prices and loan modifications 
we believe housing prices are much closer to the bottom of this housing cycle  but we expect further price declines 
we note that home price depreciation since in the case shiller composite has been sufficient to restore nation wide housing affordability to levels consistent with long term stability 
price to rent and price to income metrics are within their historic range  which suggests that the fundamentally driven reversion in home prices is nearing an end for the nation as a whole  but not necessarily in each market 
oversupply continues to be the major obstacle to a recovery in home prices 
even in markets where affordability has been restored  supply overhang is holding prices down 
this is the primary reason for our belief that housing prices have further to decline 
although there are some in favor of loan modifications and principal reductions  policymakers are struggling to address the moral hazard of appearing to reward at risk and delinquent homeowners  while other potentially qualifying homeowners continue to make their payments 
as foreclosures increase and put additional pressure on housing values  we expect the debate over loan modifications and principal reductions to be elevated by policymakers 
to the extent that principal reductions on first lien mortgages become implemented through government actions  it could undermine the value of existing rmbs particularly rmbs backed by weaker collateral and cause the pricing of credit risk in the mortgage finance markets 
commercial securities we invest in commercial securities  a type of mortgage backed security that is secured by one or more loans on commercial properties 
currently  all of our existing commercial investments at redwood are subordinate securities 
the fair value of these securities totaled million at december   as compared to million at december   a decline of million 
this decline was primarily due to declines in 
table of contents the fair values of securities and sales of commercial subordinate securities during we may acquire commercial securities in the future if pricing for these securities becomes attractive to us relative to the risks taken 
during october  we sold million of our commercial subordinate securities  which provided credit enhancement on billion of underlying loans 
our remaining investments in commercial securities consist of predominantly and subordinate bonds with a market value of million at december  these securities provided credit enhancement on billion of underlying loans on office  retail  multifamily  industrial  and other income producing properties nationwide 
seriously delinquent loans underlying commercial subordinate securities were million at december   an increase of million from december  our credit reserve of million as of december   reflects the anticipation that we will only receive a small amount of principal over the life of these securities 
since commercial securities do not prepay like residential securities  our returns will be based on our receiving interest on the outstanding face value until the anticipated credit losses occur or our cash flow is shut off due to appraisal reductions or special servicing requirements

all consolidated abs issued are collateralized by real estate loans and securities 
although the stated maturity is as shown  the abs obligations will pay down as the principal of these real estate loans or securities pay down 
the amount shown is the face value of the abs issued and not necessarily the value reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated interest payments on consolidated abs issued is calculated based on the contractual maturity of the abs and therefore assumes no prepayments of the principal outstanding as of december  redwood obligations in  we issued million of long term debt in the form of trust preferred securities through redwood capital trust i  a wholly owned delaware statutory trust  in a private placement transaction 
these trust preferred securities require quarterly distributions at a floating rate equal to three month libor plus until the notes are redeemed in whole  which will be no later than january  the earliest optional redemption date without a penalty is january  in  we issued million of long term debt in the form of subordinated notes  which require quarterly distributions at a floating rate equal to three month libor plus until the notes are redeemed  no later than july  the earliest optional redemption date without penalty is july  in july we repurchased million principal amount of this subordinated debt in the open market at a cost of million 
we may from time to time seek to purchase outstanding long term debt in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
any future repurchases would depend on numerous factors including  without limitation  pricing  market conditions  and our capital requirements 
to hedge the variability in our long term debt interest expense  we entered into interest rate swaps with aggregate notional values totaling million at february  these swaps will be accounted for as cash flow hedges with all interest income recorded as a component of net interest income and other valuation changes recorded as a component of equity through the life of the hedge 
by the end of the first quarter of  we expect to have hedged most of our outstanding long term debt  and anticipate the effective fixed rate to be approximately

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a discussion of critical accounting policies and the possible effects of changes in estimates on our financial statements is included in note summary of significant accounting policies included in item of this annual report on form k 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks we seek to manage the market risks inherent in our business including but not limited to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  and fair value risk in a prudent manner designed to enhance our earnings and dividends and preserve our capital 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with these risks 
this section presents a general overview of these risks 
additional information concerning the risks we are managing  how these risks are changing over time  and potential gaap earnings and taxable income volatility we may experience as a result of these risks is further discussed in item of this annual report on form k 
credit risk integral to our core business is assuming the credit risk of real estate loans primarily through the ownership of residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
our capital base is primarily employed in owning residential and commercial real estate backed securities  some of which have concentrated credit risks with respect to the underlying real estate loans 
we believe that many of the loans underlying the securities we own are above average in credit quality as compared to us real estate loans in general  although there may nevertheless be significant credit losses in respect to these loans 
we also take credit risk on loans with special risk factors such as higher risk commercial loans  interest only and negative amortization residential loan types  and alt a and subprime residential loans 
we may also own residential and commercial real estate loans that are not securitized 
credit losses from the loans in securitized loan pools  in general  first reduce the principal value of and economic returns on the subordinate securities in these pools 
credit losses on real estate loans can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  decline in the value of homes  businesses  or commercial properties  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the borrower or on the property  reduction in market rents and occupancies and poor property management practices  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in personal incomes  job loss  and personal events such as divorce or health problems 
in addition  if the us economy or the housing market weakens further than we have anticipated  our credit losses could increase beyond levels that we have anticipated 
credit losses on real estate loans can also occur for reasons not related to the general economy 
with respect to most of the loans securitized by securitization entities sponsored by us and for a portion of the loans underlying residential loan securities we have acquired from securitizations sponsored by others  the interest rate is adjustable  or may become adjustable after a fixed rate period of two to ten years 
accordingly  when short term interest rates rise  required monthly payments from homeowners may rise under the terms of these loans  and this may increase borrowers delinquencies and defaults 
we also acquire securities backed by negative amortization adjustable rate loans made to residential borrowers  some of which are prime quality loans while many are alt a quality loans and a few are subprime loans 
we invest in these riskier loan types with the expectation of significantly higher delinquencies and losses as compared to regular amortization loans  but believe these securities offer us the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns as a result of attractive pricing and the manner in which these securitizations are structured 
nevertheless  there remains substantial uncertainty about the future performance of these assets 

table of contents the large majority of the commercial loans we credit enhance are fixed rate loans  some of which are interest only loans 
in general  these loans are not fully amortizing and therefore require balloon payments at maturity 
consequently  we could be exposed to credit losses at the maturity of these loans if the borrower is unable to repay or refinance the borrowing with another third party lender 
while we will experience credit losses on residential and commercial loans and securities  to the extent the losses are consistent with the amount and timing of our assumptions we expect to earn attractive returns on our investments 
we manage our credit risks by understanding the extent of the risk we are taking and insuring the appropriate underwriting criteria are met  and we utilize systems and staff to continually monitor the ongoing credit performance of each loan and security 
to the extent we find the credit risks on specific assets are changing adversely  we may be able to take actions which may include selling the assets to mitigate potential losses 
however  we may not always be successful in foreseeing adverse changes in credit performance or in effectively mitigating future credit losses and the ability to sell an asset may be limited due to the structure of the asset or the absence of a market for the asset 
in addition to residential and commercial subordinate securities  redwood  the fund  and acacia own senior and other securities issued by securitization entities that are sponsored by others 
a risk we face with respect to these securities is that we do not generally control or influence the underwriting  servicing  management  or loss mitigation with respect to these underlying loans 
redwood  the fund  and the acacia entities also own securities backed by subprime and alt a residential loans that have substantially higher credit risk characteristics than prime quality loans 
consequently  we can expect these lower quality loans to have higher rates of delinquency and loss  and if such losses differ from our assumptions  acacia  the fund  and redwood could suffer losses 
the acacia entities also own certain senior and subordinate securities purchased from the sequoia securitization entities we sponsor 
if the pools of residential and commercial loans underlying these securities were to experience poor credit results  these securities could suffer decreases in fair value or could experience principal losses 
if any of these events occurs  it would likely reduce our returns from these investments 
interest rate risk interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can affect the cash flows and fair values of our assets  liabilities  and interest rate agreements  and consequently  affect our earnings and reported equity 
our general strategy with respect to interest rates is to maintain an asset liability posture including hedges on a consolidated basis that assumes some interest rate risks but not to such a degree that the achievement of our long term goals would likely be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we are willing to accept short term volatility of earnings and changes in our reported equity in order to accomplish our goal of achieving attractive long term returns 
to implement our interest rate risk strategy  we may use interest rate agreements in an effort to maintain a close match between pledged assets and debt  as well as between the interest rate characteristics of the assets in the securitization entities and the corresponding abs issued 
however  we generally do not attempt to completely hedge changes in interest rates  and at times  we may be subject to more interest rate risk than we generally desire in the long term 
changes in interest rates will have an impact on the values and cash flows of our assets and corresponding liabilities 
prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that benefits from investments in prepayment sensitive assets while limiting the risk of adverse prepayment fluctuations to an amount that  in most circumstances  can be absorbed by our capital base while still allowing us to make regular dividend payments 
prepayments affect gaap earnings in the near term primarily through the timing of the amortization of purchase premium and discount and through triggering market valuation adjustments 
for example  amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expense from premium assets  and vice versa 
in addition  variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets and changes in interest rates as they affect projected coupons on arms and other assets and thus change effective yield calculations may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income 
table of contents to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
moreover  the timing of premium amortization on assets may not always match the timing of the premium amortization on liabilities even when the underlying assets and liabilities are in the same securitization and pay down at the same rate 
prepayment risks exist in the assets and associated liabilities consolidated on our balance sheets 
in general  discount securities benefit from faster prepayment rates on the underlying real estate loans while premium securities such as ios benefit from slower prepayments on the underlying loans 
we are currently biased in favor of faster prepayment speeds with respect to the long term economic effect of residential loan prepayments 
however  in the short term  increases in residential loan prepayment rates could result in gaap earnings volatility 
with respect to securities backed by residential mortgage loans and in particular  ios  changes in prepayment forecasts by market participants could affect the market values of those securities sold by securitization entities  and thus could affect the profits we earn from securitizing assets 
our credit results and risks can also be affected by prepayments 
for example  credit risks for the securities we own are reduced each time a loan prepays 
all other factors being equal  faster prepayment rates should reduce our credit risks on our existing portfolio 
we caution that prepayment rates are difficult to predict or anticipate  and variations in prepayment rates can materially affect our earnings and dividend distribution requirements 
arm prepayment rates  for example  are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  arm prepayments typically increase 
however  for borrowers who have impaired credit or who otherwise do not meet loan underwriting criteria  the ability to refinance ie  prepay a loan even when interest rates decline may be limited 
fair value and liquidity risks the securities that we sponsor are generally funded with equity with no associated recourse debt that might affect our liquidity position 
on january  we elected the fair value option for assets and liabilities at acacia  with all changes in market values now being recorded through our income statement 
though this adds to our potential earnings volatility  the securities and abs issued by acacia entities have no recourse to us that would otherwise affect our liquidity position 
changes in the fair values or ratings downgrades of assets owned by an acacia entity may also create differences between our reported gaap and taxable income 
however  we do not currently believe this will create liquidity issues for us 
most of the real estate loans that we consolidate are accounted for as held for investment and reported at amortized cost 
most of these loans have been sold to sequoia entities and  thus  changes in the fair value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity 
however  changes in fair values during the accumulation period while these loans are funded with short term debt before they are sold to a sequoia entity may have a short term effect on our liquidity 
we may also own some real estate loans accounted for as held for sale and adverse changes in their value would be recognized through our income statement and may have an impact on our ability to obtain financing for them 
our consolidated obligations consist primarily of abs issued 
changes in fair value of abs issued generally have no impact on our liquidity 
abs issued by sequoia are reported at amortized cost as are the residential loans collateralizing these abs 
beginning january   we report at fair value the abs issued by acacia and also report the underlying securities collateralizing these abs issued at fair value 
in either case  the resulting net equity assets less liabilities may not necessarily be reflective of the fair value of our interests in these securitization entities 
however  since the abs issued can only look to the cash flows generated by the assets within that securitization for payments of interest and repayments of the face value of the abs  the changes in fair value do not have an effect on redwood s liquidity 
only to the extent that changes in fair values affect the timing of the cash flows we might receive on our investments in the acacia entities  is there an effect to redwood from changes in fair values of these securities 
there are no such considerations in the sequoia securitization entities 

table of contents we may fund some assets with a combination of short term debt and equity generally prior to securitization that is recourse to redwood 
this generally increases our fair value and liquidity risks 
we manage these risks by maintaining what we believe to be conservative capital levels under our internal risk adjusted capital and risk management policies and by ensuring we have a variety of financing facilities available to fund each of these assets 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
our activities and balance sheets are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation 
effect of government initiatives on market risks recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging 
there are continuing concerns about the overall economy  the systemic impact of inflation or deflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  unemployment  and the declining real estate market in the us these market and economic conditions have spurred government initiatives and interventions designed to address them 
given the size and scope of the government actions  they will affect many of the market risks described above  although the total impact is not yet fully known 
as these initiatives are further developed and their effects become more apparent we will continue to seek to take them into account in managing the risks inherent in our business 

table of contents quantitative information on market risk our future earnings are sensitive to a number of market risk factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
to supplement this discussion on the market risk we face  the following table incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market risks that may affect our consolidated balance sheets at december  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with the forward curve 
our future results depend greatly on the credit performance of the underlying loans this table assumes no credit losses  future interest rates  prepayments  and our ability to invest our existing cash and future cash flow 
as discussed in this annual report on form k  the composition of our securities portfolio has changed over the past year  as most of our recent acquisitions have been senior securities 
the presentation of the information in this table has also been revised from last year to conform to how we analyze securities and cash flow 
that is  the table now presents categories of securities by their senior or subordinate cash flow priority within their respective securitization structures 
last year we categorized this information by whether a security was investment grade and credit enhancement or non investment grade 
this new categorization  which we started using at the beginning of  is consistent with the fact that  in analyzing our market risk  we are more focused on where a security sits with regard to seniority of cash flow than to its credit rating
