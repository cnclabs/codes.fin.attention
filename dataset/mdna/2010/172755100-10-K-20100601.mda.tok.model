table of contents overview we were incorporated in california in  became a public company in and were reincorporated in the state of delaware in february initially  our focus was on providing ics for personal computer applications  including personal computer pc graphics and storage 
in  we refocused our business efforts away from these areas  which we believed had become commodity like in terms of pricing and offered diminished opportunities for sustained product differentiation and profitability 
we reinforced our commitment to operate efficiently and profitably by taking strategic actions beginning in to improve our top and bottom line growth  including improving efficiencies by focusing on our product lines including mixed signal audio and energy products  divesting our digital video product line assets and non core products to focus on our core strengths  and enhancing our capital structure by completing a million stock repurchase program in fiscal year to increase long term stockholder value 
we continued this process in fiscal year by focusing on winning new designs  growing our market share in portable audio products in particular  and by laying the foundation for growth in our energy products 
fiscal year in spite of the continuing credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges affecting the global economy throughout our fiscal year  fiscal year net sales of million represented a percent increase over fiscal year net sales of million 
further  the fiscal year net sales performance represented the highest fiscal year net sales amount for the company since our fiscal year results 
increased sales from our audio product line  in particular portable audio and surround codec products were key drivers in the overall improvement in top line revenues in fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year 
while fiscal year net sales from our energy product line reflected a net percent reduction from fiscal year results  the energy product line ended its fiscal year on a positive note as increased sales of seismic and power meter products  as well as improved performance from arm and communication products  resulted in fiscal year fourth quarter energy product revenue growth of percent over the third quarter of fiscal year and percent over the fourth quarter of fiscal year we saw improvements in a variety of our energy product lines throughout the most recent fiscal year  as our traditional industrial business benefitted from the improving economy 
seismic product sales are still down from peak levels  although it has improved over prior quarters 
overall gross margin of percent for fiscal year reflected a decrease from fiscal year margin of percent due to the recent growth in sales of portable audio products  as well as a mix change to lower margin products in our energy product line driven primarily by a reduction in seismic product sales in fiscal the company continued to prudently manage expenses given the continued poor macroeconomic conditions  although we did take advantage of the availability of engineering talent  which resulted in a modest increase to the overall employee headcount during fiscal year the company achieved net income of million in fiscal year  which included an million recognition of deferred tax assets 
the million of net income in fiscal year represented an increase of million over fiscal year net income of million 
finally  the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments balances as of march   of million reflects an increase of million over the ending balances from the prior fiscal year 
fiscal year the credit market crisis and other macro economic challenges affected the global economy  the semiconductor industry  and our own results of operations in fiscal year the recession reduced both business and consumer spending  which impacted sales of end user products that incorporate our components 
consequently  for fiscal year net sales were down approximately percent from the preceding year 
however  our strength in revenue from new products and prudent expense management were key drivers in the company maintaining bottom line profitability for the year as a whole while establishing a solid base for future growth 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we announced a million stock repurchase program 
no share repurchases under this program have occurred as of march  page of 
table of contents fiscal year during fiscal year  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock of apex microelectronics corporation for a purchase price of approximately million  consisting primarily of cash and direct acquisition costs 
apex designs and produces integrated circuits  hybrids and modules used in a wide range of industrial and aerospace applications that require high power precision analog products  such as pwm s and power amplifiers 
these precision amplifiers are used for driving motors and piezoelectric devices  programmable power supplies and other devices requiring high power and precision control 
in fiscal year  we took additional steps to improve our competitive cost structure 
first  we committed to a plan to close caretta integrated circuits caretta  a subsidiary based in shanghai  china 
we also made a strategic decision to further streamline our organization structure  which resulted in an additional headcount reduction of employees 
finally  on january   we announced that our board authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
the company completed this share repurchase program on april   and purchased a total of million shares  or approximately percent of the total number of shares outstanding prior to the program 
all shares of our common stock that were repurchased were cancelled as of june  results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations for each of the past three fiscal years as a percentage of net sales 
all percentage amounts were calculated using the underlying data in thousands fiscal years ended march  march  march  audio products energy products net sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring costs and other  net impairment of proceeds from non marketable securities acquired in process research and development provision benefit for litigation expenses and settlements patent agreement  net impairment of intangible assets income loss from operations interest income other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales we report sales in two product categories audio products and energy products 
our sales by product line are as follows in thousands march  march  march  audio products energy products total page of 
table of contents net sales for fiscal year increased percent  to million from million in fiscal year the increase in net sales reflects a million increase in audio product sales and a million decrease in energy product sales 
the audio products group experienced growth from the sales of portable and surround codecs products  which were partially offset by decreases in adc and interface product sales 
within the energy product group  sales decreases were primarily attributable to lower sales of seismic  communications  and arm processor based products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in power meter products sales 
net sales for fiscal year decreased percent  to million from million in fiscal year the drop in net sales reflects a million decrease in energy product sales and a million decrease in audio product sales 
within the energy product group  sales decreases were primarily attributable to seismic  industrial a d converters and amplifiers  communications  and arm processor based products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in apex precision power product sales  primarily attributable to a full years contribution in fiscal year  as apex was acquired by the company on july  the audio products group experienced substantial growth from sales of portable products  which were partially offset by decreases in dac and adc product sales 
export sales  principally to asia  including sales to us based customers that manufacture products at plants overseas  were approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year export sales to customers located in asia were percent of net sales in fiscal year  percent of net sales in fiscal year  and percent of net sales in fiscal year all other export sales represented percent  percent  and percent of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars 
during fiscal years   and  we did not enter into any foreign currency hedging contracts 
gross margin gross margin was percent in fiscal year  down from percent in fiscal year the decrease in margin from fiscal year was mainly due to changes in both customer and product mix 
while the audio product group experienced a slight increase in margin from fiscal year to fiscal year and the energy group margins were essentially unchanged for this comparable period  the increase in the percentage of sales from the audio group in fiscal year caused a net reduction in overall margins 
the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent  to gross margin compared to a contribution of approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges increased by million from fiscal year  which decreased gross margin by percent

finally  non recurring engineering worked performed and billed to third parties resulted in an additional million reduction in research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year  or percent  compared to fiscal year as an increase in salaries and benefits costs was offset by decreased expenses across several expense categories 
a million increase in salaries and benefits costs was primarily attributable to increased headcount  and also due to higher sales commissions brought on by increased product sales and fluctuations in commissionable product mix in fiscal year versus fiscal year offsetting this increase was a million reduction in net rent expenses  a decrease in marketing expenses  and a million reduction in professional expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal year  or percent  compared to fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in professional expenses caused by the absence of fees associated with the internal stock option investigation performed in fiscal year and the reduction in silvaco lawsuit expenses 
see also part item legal proceedings for additional discussion regarding the silvaco data systems lawsuit 
commission expense decreased million due primarily to lower sales and fluctuations in commissionable product mix in fiscal year versus fiscal year salaries and benefits costs were million lower in fiscal year versus fiscal year  primarily due to reduced headcount and other associated employee costs 
finally  occupancy costs in fiscal year were million lower than in fiscal year  primarily due to the termination of a lease in fremont  california 
restructuring costs and other  net during fiscal year  we recorded net restructuring charges of million as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption restructuring costs and other  net 
the restructuring charge was primarily due to revised sublease assumptions for lease space within our corporate headquarters building 
see also note restructuring costs and other of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item for additional discussion on these restructuring activities 
during fiscal year  we recorded net restructuring charges of million as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption restructuring costs and other  net 
this net charge was comprised primarily of two separate steps taken to improve our competitive cost structure 
first  we committed to a plan to close caretta  a subsidiary based in shanghai  china 
this action eliminated approximately positions in china during the company s fourth fiscal quarter  and resulted in the company recording primarily a non cash charge for the assets and goodwill related to caretta of million  as well as million in cash payments for the affected employees 
also in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reduced headcount by employees 
the restructuring charge associated with this activity amounted to million  and were primarily related to employee severance costs

the proceeds were recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of proceeds from non marketable securities 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we determined an impairment indicator existed related to our remaining cost method investment in magnum  as magnum had received additional capital funding from other sources  and our portion of the investment was diluted 
we performed a fair value analysis of our cost method investment in magnum in accordance with fasb asc topic investments debt and equity securities 
based on the results of the analysis on september   we recognized an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of the magnum cost method investment to zero 
the impairment was recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of proceeds from non marketable securities

table of contents impairment of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we noted several impairment indicators surrounding our patents acquired from tripath in june we performed an impairment analysis under fasb asc topic property  plant  and equipment  and noted that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from these patents were less than the carrying amount of the assets 
we then compared the estimated fair value of these assets to their carrying amount and recognized an impairment loss of million 
the impairment was recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of intangible assets 
interest income interest income in fiscal years   and  was million  million  and million respectively 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal years and was attributable to two factors i lower average invested capital balances on which interest was earned  which were million  million  and million  respectively  for fiscal years   and and ii lower yields on invested capital 
the decreases in the average invested capital balances from fiscal year to fiscal year are principally attributable to the cash requirements associated with the company s common stock repurchases occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year on january  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
the company completed the stock repurchase program on april   for a total of million with million shares repurchased at an average price of per share 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year on a pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax benefit rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of percent  primarily as a result of the realization of deferred tax assets that had been fully reserved and the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that have not yet been utilized 
the release of a portion of the valuation allowance generated an million tax benefit and was based on an evaluation of the net us deferred tax assets that we expect to utilize in the upcoming year as a result of projected tax basis net income 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal year on a pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of percent primarily due to a million charge to tax expense to increase the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal year on a pre tax loss of million  yielding an effective tax rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of percent primarily due to a million charge to tax expense to increase the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we have deferred tax assets generated in non us jurisdictions that we have recognized since it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
outlook we came into the year with high expectations driven by our growing successes in portable audio  and we exceeded those expectations on the strength of demand from a variety of product lines outside of portable 
we also took advantage of opportunities in the labor market by hiring promising engineering talent 
by maintaining control over variable expenses  the growth in revenue and stable margins allowed us to deliver significantly improved earnings for fiscal year subject to macro economic conditions in the coming fiscal year and other business risk factors as described in item a  we are optimistic that this momentum can continue 
page of 
table of contents there are multiple drivers that can enable strong operational and financial performance in fiscal year on the audio side of our business  our strategy is to target growing markets  work with tier one customers in those markets  and develop outstanding technology that solves critical problems for them 
we strive for strong engineer to engineer relationships at these key accounts  which has resulted in a growing base of design wins across many products in this market 
our emphasis is on exceeding the expectations of our existing customers  yet we are focused on winning new customers 
new products targeting the general mobile phone market will be publically launched in fiscal year  and we are actively promoting these new parts to key customers 
within home audio  in fiscal year we announced our first nm dsp and this product is currently ramping into production with a key customer in japan 
we ve also seen signs of improvement in other audio markets we serve  such as automotive 
within the energy side of our business  we saw improvements in a variety of our energy product lines throughout the year 
our traditional industrial business benefits from the improving economy 
seismic is still down from its peak levels  but it has improved over prior quarters  which adds incrementally to gross margin 
our current investments in the energy product lines are focused on power meters  and the energy control areas such as power factor correction  lighting  and motor control 
we have been in the power meter business for many years  and the recent push for smart grid enhancements has created new opportunities worldwide 
our most recent power meter product to hit production shipped over a million units per quarter during the second half of fiscal year we are in the product definition phase for the next generation of low cost metrology chips for the global market  and much like portable audio  our focus is on tier one accounts in this market 
we are actively promoting our first pfc product  and look to parlay this effort into an enhanced lineup of derivative products 
overall  we believe that we are well positioned to face the challenges presented by the current economic environment  but future sales  costs  margins  profits and profitability are all influenced by numerous factors  all of which are inherently difficult to forecast

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts 
we evaluate the estimates on an on going basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we also have policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and cost of sales on sales to our distributors  and our stock option granting practices  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock compensation expense under the provisions of fasb asc topic  equity and fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  we perform an analysis of current market data and historical company data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility  the expected term of the option  and the expected forfeiture rate 
with the exception of the expected forfeiture rate  which is not an input  we use these estimates as variables in the black scholes option pricing model 
depending upon the number of stock options granted  any fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on the results presented in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  any differences between estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on our financial statements 
the company evaluates accounts receivable in accordance with fasb asc topic  receivables 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the age of the receivable  our ongoing customer relations  as well as any disputes with the customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
additionally  we may maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on receivables from customers with whom we page of 
table of contents are involved in litigation 
see note accounts receivable  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company evaluates inventory in accordance with fasb asc topic  inventory 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand  management judgment  and the age of inventory 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  and fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
we test for impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
an impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of these assets exceeds the fair value of the applicable assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note intangibles  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the total consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry  or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
our available for sale investments  non marketable securities and other investments are subject to a periodic impairment review pursuant to fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
this determination requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different than our estimate 
marketable securities are evaluated for impairment if the decline in fair value below cost basis is significant and or has lasted for an extended period of time 
non marketable securities or other investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
for investments accounted for using the cost method of accounting  we evaluate information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements in addition to quoted market prices  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit page of 
table of contents defaults  and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment 
this list is not all inclusive and we weigh all quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period s operating results to the extent of the decline 
actual values could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note marketable securities and note non marketable securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item in accordance with statement of fasb asc topic  income taxes  we provide for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we have provided a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis by determining whether or not the anticipated pre tax income for the upcoming twelve months is expected to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized 
if our future income is not sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized  we increase the valuation allowance to the point at which all of the remaining recognized deferred tax assets will be utilized by the anticipated future pre tax income for the next twelve months 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in a simultaneous increase to income tax expense or  in some cases  a decrease in contributed capital 
if our anticipated future pre tax income is sufficient to conclude that additional deferred tax assets should be recognized  we decrease the valuation allowance 
this results in a simultaneous decrease to income tax expense or  possibly  an increase in contributed capital 
see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item restructuring charges for workforce reductions and facilities consolidations reflected in the accompanying financial statements were accrued based upon specific plans established by management  in accordance with fasb asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we use an estimated borrowing rate as the discount rate for all of our restructuring accruals made under fasb asc topic our facilities consolidation accruals are based upon our estimates as to the length of time a facility would be vacant  as well as the amount of sublease income we would receive once we sublet the facility  after considering current and projected market conditions 
changes in these estimates could result in an adjustment to our restructuring accruals in a future quarter  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note restructuring costs and other of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies for various legal matters 
see note legal matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be made based on the status of the case  the results of the discovery process and other factors 
if we ultimately determine that an accrual should be made for a legal matter  this accrual could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position and the ultimate outcome may be materially different than our estimate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on our debt securities  currency movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  and the affect of market factors on the value of our non marketable equity securities 
we assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses as of march  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our primary financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
the company s investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the company 
these guidelines include security page of 
table of contents type  credit quality  and maturity  and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the company s investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment  our downside exposure to interest rate risk is minimal 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could result in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
however  our investment portfolio holdings as of march   yielded less than basis points  which reduces our downside interest rate risk to an amount slightly less than the million calculation 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could have resulted in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could have resulted in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
for all of these fiscal years  the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates were limited to our annual interest income and not the underlying principal as we generally have the ability to hold debt related investments to maturity 
the amounts disclosed in this paragraph are based on a basis point fluctuation in interest rates applied to the average cash balance for that fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange risk our revenue and spending is transacted primarily in us dollars  however  in fiscal years   and  we entered into minimal transactions in other currencies to fund the operating needs of our design  technical support  and sales offices outside of the us as of march   and march   a ten percent change in the value of the related currencies would not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates on the value of open exchange contracts  we may  from time to time  have changes in exchange rates that can also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices of our products and the relative costs of operations based overseas 
non marketable securities risk our investments in non marketable securities are affected by many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of market prices  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
such a movement and the underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in  their ability to raise additional capital  and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings  mergers  or private sales 
these types of investments involve a great deal of risk  and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful  consequently  we could lose all or part of our investment 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we determined an impairment indicator existed related to our remaining million cost method investment in magnum  as magnum had participated in another round of capital funding from other sources  and our portion of the investment was diluted 
we performed a fair value analysis of our cost method investment in magnum in accordance with fasb asc topic investments debt and equity securities 
based on the results of that analysis as of september   we recognized an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of the magnum cost method investment to zero 
the impairment is recorded as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of proceeds from non marketable securities 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  as part of a convertible note financing round for magnum  we received proceeds of thousand from magnum as consideration for our ownership interest in magnum securities 
the proceeds were recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of proceeds from non marketable securities 
at march   we had no remaining investments in non marketable securities
