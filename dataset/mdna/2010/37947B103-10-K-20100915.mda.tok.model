item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we provide traffic and news information reports to radio and television stations in international markets 
we are the largest provider of traffic information reports to radio stations in australia  canada and the united kingdom and we provide traffic information reports to television stations in australia and canada 
we also provide news information reports to radio stations in canada  entertainment news reports to radio stations in the united kingdom and we believe that we maintain the largest inventory of commercial advertising embedded in radio news reports in australia 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from the sale to advertisers of commercial advertising inventory associated with these information reports 
we obtain this advertising inventory from radio and television stations in exchange for information reports and or  for certain broadcasters  cash compensation 
although we are a nevada corporation with principal executive offices located in new york  new york  we do not provide  nor do we intend to provide traffic or news reports to radio or television stations in the united states 
however  we do intend to offer our mobile traffic products to radio and television stations in the united states 
our operations are conducted through the following wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries australia traffic network canadian traffic network uk traffic network uk commercial traffic network mobile traffic network global traffic network  inc is a holding company and conducts no operations 
unless we indicate otherwise  the discussions below regarding our financial condition and results of operations present information on a consolidated basis and all material inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated 
the services we provide radio traffic reports  radio news reports and tv reports 
the information reports we provide to radio and television stations are divided into three categories  radio traffic reports  radio news reports and tv reports  based on the content of the report and the medium in which it is delivered 
collectively  we refer to these reports as our information reports 
the radio stations that contract to provide us with traffic and news report advertising inventory become members of our radio network 
likewise  the television stations that contract to receive our tv reports become members of our tv network 
collectively  we refer to the members of these networks as our network affiliates 
we currently offer radio traffic and television traffic reports and video footage to our network affiliates in australia  while obtaining radio news report advertising inventory by paying cash compensation to our news network affiliates 
we provide radio traffic reports and tv reports to our network affiliates in canada  as well as news  weather  business and sports reports to our radio network affiliates on a limited basis 
in the united kingdom  we provide radio stations with traffic and entertainment news information and reports that are primarily provided through third party out source providers that we compensate 
our sources of revenue sale of commercial airtime inventory in exchange for providing our information reports and or  for certain broadcasters  cash compensation  our network affiliates provide us with commercial advertising inventory 
we generate revenues by packaging and selling this commercial advertising inventory for cash to advertisers on a local  regional or national network basis  except in the united kingdom where it is sold on a national basis only 
to date  we have recognized no revenue related to the bartering of goods and services and do not anticipate entering into barter transactions for the sale of our commercial advertising inventory in the future 
the substantial majority of our revenues have been generated from our australian operations  including approximately million  or  of our revenues for year ended june  approximately million  or of our total revenue for fiscal  has been generated from the sale of commercial advertising inventory related to our australian radio traffic reports 
for the year ended june   approximately million  or of our revenues  was generated by our australian operations and approximately million  or  was generated from the sale of commercial advertising inventory related to our australian radio traffic reports 
for the year ended june   approximately million  or of our revenues  was generated by our australian operations and approximately million  or  was generated from the sale of commercial advertising inventory related to our australian radio traffic reports 
we expect to accumulate increasing amounts of commercial advertising inventory from our australian operations as we continue to obtain more news report inventory in australia 
we began generating revenue in canada in and currently have operations in eight canadian cities calgary  toronto  hamilton  vancouver  montreal  ottawa  edmonton and winnipeg 
as commercial advertising inventory generated from our canadian operations and our expanded australian operations increases  we expect to sell the increased commercial advertising inventory in the same manner as we have sold commercial advertising inventory generated from our provision of radio traffic reports in australia 
our experience indicates  however  that there is generally a delay between acquiring commercial advertising inventory from new or expanded operations and the realization of increasing revenue from the sale of such inventory 
we experienced such a delay when we added austereo as a network affiliate of our radio network in fiscal year although the additional commercial advertising inventory we acquired from austereo led to increased revenues during fiscal year  the full impact on revenues from the sale of such inventory was not realized until fiscal year we also experienced a similar lag when we began to receive news report inventory from austereo in july we expect to experience similar delays in realizing revenues from the sale of commercial advertising inventory associated with additional radio news reports in australia and our provision of additional radio traffic reports in canada 

table of contents our expenses our expenses are primarily comprised of three categories operating expenses  selling expenses and general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses consist of station compensation and all expenses related to the gathering  producing  and broadcasting of our information reports  including aviation costs and expenses  salaries and benefits for our on air personalities who deliver the information reports and payments to third parties that provide information and reporting services 
station compensation consists of the reimbursement of expenses incurred by stations which we would otherwise incur in providing services to the station  as well as any additional cash consideration paid to a network affiliate in exchange for commercial advertising inventory 
we may incur increased expenses in the form of station compensation in connection with adding certain broadcasters to our base of network affiliates 
as mentioned above  our experience indicates that in such instances there is generally a delay between acquiring commercial advertising inventory from new network affiliates and the realization of increased revenue from the sale of such inventory 
aviation costs relate to the costs of our airborne surveillance  an integral part of our information gathering  and consist both of payments to outside vendors to lease aircraft and the operating costs including fuel  maintenance  and insurance costs associated with the operation of our fleet of owned aircraft 
our fleet of leased and owned aircraft currently consists of australia canada united kingdom leased owned leased owned leased owned fixed wing aircraft helicopters selling expenses include salaries and benefits for our sales personnel and commissions paid on sales of our commercial advertising inventory 
general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead  including administrative salaries  real property lease payments  insurance  salaries and benefits for our corporate executive officers  compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock and legal and accounting fees 
expenses other than selling expenses are generally incurred evenly over the applicable fiscal year 
basis of presentation we derive substantially all of our revenue and incur a substantial majority of our expenses from our australian  canadian and united kingdom operations 
however  the financial information contained in this form k  including the financial statements  report our financial condition and results of operation in united states dollars and unless stated otherwise  all references to monetary amounts refer to united states dollars 
income statement amounts are converted from australian dollars  canadian dollars or british pounds to united states dollars based on the average exchange rate for each quarterly period covered 
assets and liabilities are converted based on the exchange rate as of the applicable balance sheet date 
equity is converted based on the exchange rate in place at the time of the applicable investment 
foreign currency translation adjustments occur when the income statement and balance sheet are converted at different exchange rates and are recognized as other comprehensive income or loss in the financial statements 
for reference  the exchange rates from australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds to united states dollars applicable to our income statement data for each of the three month periods ended june    and  march   and  december   and and september   and and applicable to our balance sheet data as of june  and are set forth below australia exchange balance income statement period rate sheet date exchange rate three month period ended june  june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  three month period ended june  june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  three month period ended june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september

this weakening of the us dollar caused our australian and canadian revenues and expenses to be higher than they otherwise would be if the exchange rates were consistent for both periods 
the united states dollar was stronger on average throughout the course of the year ended june  compared to the british pound  which resulted in our revenues and expenses being lower than they otherwise would have been had exchange rates remained constant 
we estimate that the impact from the currency changes in australia  canada and united kingdom on our operating results for the fiscal years ended june  and compared to the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  has been to increase or decrease income statement data as follows year year ended ended june  june  in thousands in thousands australia revenues operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense sales  general administrative expenses canada revenues operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense sales  general administrative expenses united kingdom revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense operating expenses sales  general administrative expenses australia  canada and united kingdom combined revenues operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense sales  general administrative expenses 
table of contents when discussing changes in income statement accounts from the year ended june  to the year ended june  and from the year ended june  to the year ended june   the analysis under results of operations below includes both the impact of currency changes and changes in revenues and expenditures in the local currency 
seasonality of business we believe that advertising revenues in general vary moderately over the calendar year  with the three month period ending december generally resulting in the highest revenues and the three month period ending march generally resulting in the lowest revenues 
this industry trend is mainly attributable to increases in the level of advertiser demand  and resulting increases in average advertising spot rates and or number of spots sold  during the months leading up to the christmas holiday season and lower advertiser demand following the end of the holiday season which leads to lower average advertising spot rates and or number of spots sold during that time 
we believe that this general trend in advertising revenues is applicable to our business 
over the past five fiscal years however  the financial impact of seasonality has been offset by the rapid revenue growth  and in certain cases  favorable exchange rate movements  as revenues for the quarter ending march have exceeded revenues for the quarter ended september during four of these five fiscal years  with the lone exception being the year ended june  our revenues during the third fiscal quarter of were significantly impacted by a stronger us dollar  which lowered our reported revenues in us dollars 
for similar reasons as outlined above  our fiscal fourth quarter has generated more revenue than fiscal second quarter for each of the four fiscal years ended june  in fiscal  however  revenues for the quarter ended december  exceeded revenues for the quarter ended june  our expenses other than sales costs are generally spread evenly over the fiscal year 
as a result  we generally experience seasonality in the amount of our net income absent growth due to the addition of new network affiliates 
acquisition of the unique broadcasting company limited on february   uk traffic network entered into a definitive share purchase agreement to acquire the unique broadcasting company limited unique and the acquisition was completed effective march   at which point unique was renamed global traffic network uk commercial limited uk commercial traffic network

approximately million of the increase related to shortening the useful lives of the canadian traffic network helicopters from eight years to six years and reducing the canadian traffic network helicopter engine rebuild useful lives from three years to two years 
this change in estimate was made due to our flying more hours per year in canada than originally anticipated

other income decreased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  other income consists primarily of interest income on our cash balances and the reduction is attributable mainly to lower interest rates during the current period and our reduced cash balances due to the purchase of uk commercial traffic network formerly unique 
the reduction in other income was partially mitigated by foreign currency translation income of approximately million for the year ended june  compared to no foreign currency translation income or loss during the period 
the foreign currency translation income resulted from the repayment of balances due to the company by australia traffic network 
intercompany balances between the company and its subsidiaries are translated from the local currencies to us dollars at each balance sheet date

the united states shareholders of australia traffic network recorded their share of australia traffic network s income on their personal income tax returns and received deduction on their united states federal income tax returns for the australian taxes paid 
because australian income taxes are generally lower than united states income taxes  a tax liability was passed on to each united states shareholder 
australia traffic network s then existing shareholders became liable for the tax triggered by the share exchange 
prior to the effective time of the initial public offering  we issued the share exchange notes  in an aggregate amount of million  to the australia traffic network shareholders 
the share exchange notes were intended to cover the estimated tax consequences to such shareholders of the share exchange 
upon the closing of the initial public offering  we repaid the share exchange notes in full 
we operate as a united states corporation with wholly owned direct and indirect operating subsidiaries in australia  canada and united kingdom 
we will pay income taxes in those countries as well as in the united states

table of contents contractual commitments the table below sets forth our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations outsource provider obligations station obligations total critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition revenue recognition 
revenues are earned and recognized at the time commercial advertisements are broadcast 
payments received in advance or amounts invoiced in advance are deferred until earned and such payments and amounts are included as a component of deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
all revenues pertain to cash sales 
we determine that commercial advertisements are broadcast based on the announcers written verification on the broadcast log or written or electronic verification from our network affiliates for advertisements they broadcast 
the broadcast log is a schedule of station  time and advertiser for each report that an announcer broadcasts 
the broadcast logs are generated by our scheduling department through our automated scheduling system  based on advertising sales orders and our network affiliate stations scheduled report times 
revenues are reported net of commissions given to third party advertising agencies that represent a majority of our advertisers 
sales taxes  goods and services taxes  value added taxes and similar charges collected by our operating subsidiaries on behalf of government authorities are not included as a component of revenue 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and are not interest bearing 
we perform credit evaluations of new customers and generally require no collateral 
whether an accounts receivable is past due is determined in a subjective manner based primarily on how long it has been outstanding  but taking into consideration factors such as client size  payment history and country to which the receivable relates 
goods and services tax and value added tax  which is invoiced and collected by operating subsidiaries in australia  canada and united kingdom are included in accounts receivable 
fees related to credit card payments are expensed when payment for the receivable is received and have historically not been material 
the company provides for losses from uncollectible accounts based on analyzing historical data and current trends and such losses have historically been insignificant in relation to revenue 
past due amounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is deemed unlikely and all collection efforts have ceased 
an allowance for doubtful accounts of   and  has been established for the years ended june   and  respectively

a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets unless their realization is considered more likely than not 
currently  of the canadian tax loss carry forwards generated by us are allowed for since it is not yet reasonably certain that our operations in canada will be profitable in the future to utilize these tax loss carry forwards 
in addition  we have made a allowance for the losses of uk traffic network but not uk commercial traffic network since we are currently unable to offset these losses against the expected future profits of uk commercial traffic network  which is the subsidiary that was formerly unique

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and long term debt 
we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
however  due to the large cash and cash equivalents balances  a one percent decrease in the interest rates we earn on these balances would reduce interest income approximately million on an annual basis based on the balances at june  we have no derivative financial instruments or auction rate securities in our cash and cash equivalents 
we had no outstanding long term debt at june  we had an unutilized bank overdraft line of credit of approximately million that bears interest at a variable rate 
we do not see the variable interest rate long term debt as a significant interest rate risk since we have no current plans to borrow money under the bank overdraft line of credit 
foreign currency exchange risk we have significant foreign subsidiaries located in australia  canada and the united kingdom 
the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds  respectively  and as such are translated into united states dollars 
income statement amounts are translated from australian dollars  canadian dollars  or british pounds to united states dollars based on the average exchange rate for each quarterly period 
assets and liabilities are translated based on the exchange rate as of the applicable balance sheet date 
equity contribution are translated based on the exchange rate at the time of the applicable investment 
foreign currency translation adjustments occur when the income statement and balance sheet are converted at different exchange rates and are recognized as other comprehensive income or loss in the financial statements 
we do not currently hedge for currency fluctuations with our foreign subsidiaries 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the large number of customers and the fact that no one customer represents more than of our annual revenue 
however  one group of advertising agencies that represents a number of the company s clients in australia  united kingdom and canada constituted approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended june  and approximately of the company s net accounts receivable as of june  another group of advertising agencies that represents a number of the company s clients in australia  united kingdom and canada constituted approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended june  and approximately of the company s net accounts receivable as of june  an advertising agency that represents a number of the company s clients in australia constituted approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended june  and approximately of the company s net accounts receivable as of june  another group of advertising agencies that represents a number of the company s clients in australia  united kingdom and canada constituted approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended june  and approximately of the company s net accounts receivable as of june  in addition to the aforementioned agencies  it is likely other advertising agencies may exceed of our net revenues and or of our net receivables in the future based on the current billing levels of certain agencies 
in the united kingdom  substantially all our advertising related net revenues come from five agency groups including one agency group placing approximately of our united kingdom advertising revenues for the year ending june   therefore our concentration of revenue by agency is greater in the uk market than for our company as a whole
