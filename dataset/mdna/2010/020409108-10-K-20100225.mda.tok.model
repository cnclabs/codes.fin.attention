how we are currently organized and operate the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in accounting standards codification asc topic  segment reporting  formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 

our vn segment provides a comprehensive range of medicare certified home health nursing services to patients in need of recuperative care  typically following a period of hospitalization or care in another type of inpatient facility 
our services are often provided to patients in lieu of additional care in other settings  such as long term acute care hospitals  inpatient rehabilitation hospitals or skilled nursing facilities 
our nurses  therapists  medical social workers and home health aides work closely with patients and their families to design and implement an individualized treatment response to a physician prescribed plan of care 
we also offer specialty programs based on local needs  such as our frail elderly care management  optimum balance program  cardiocare program  orthopedic program and urology program 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or hourly basis 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment provides services in patients homes on an as needed  hourly  or live in basis 
these services include personal care  medication management  meal preparation  caregiver respite and homemaking 
our services are often provided to patients who would otherwise be admitted to skilled nursing facilities for long term custodial care 
pc revenues are generated on an hourly basis 
approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
additional financial information about our segments can be found in note of our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance constituents needs for health care services within the constraints of the specific government s fiscal budgets 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan will place primary emphasis on the development of our visiting nurse operations 
our personal care operation will help us maintain a level of diversification of reimbursement risk that we believe is appropriate 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  expand the significance of our visiting nurse  medicare based  home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers  and through the startup of new agencies  and expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 
overview of our services visiting nurse services vn our visiting nurse services consist primarily of the provision of skilled in home medical services to patients in need of short term recuperative health care 
our patients are referred to us by their physicians or upon discharge from a hospital or other type of in patient facility 
we operate forty two medicare certified home health agencies with a total of eighty five locations 
in the year ended december   approximately of our visiting nurse segment revenues were derived from the federal medicare program 
our visiting nurse segment provides a comprehensive range of medicare certified home health nursing services 
we also receive payment from medicaid and private insurance companies 
our professional staff includes registered nurses  licensed practical nurses  physical  speech and occupational therapists  and medical social workers 
they monitor medical treatment plans prescribed by physicians 
our professional staff is subject to state licensing requirements in the particular states in which they practice 
para professional staff members primarily home health aides also provide care to these patients 
our visiting nurse segment operations located in florida normally experience higher admissions during the first quarter and lower admissions during the third quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations 

table of contents personal care services pc our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by para professional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are generated on an hourly basis 
we currently operate twenty three personal care locations 
as of december   our operating locations were as follows visiting nurse personal care geographic clusters branches branches southeast florida alabama northeast connecticut new jersey massachusetts pennsylvania midwest kentucky ohio missouri illinois indiana total compensation for services we are compensated for our services by i medicare visiting nurse only  ii medicaid  iii other third party payors eg insurance companies and other sources  and iv private pay paid by personal funds 
the rates of reimbursement we receive from medicare  medicaid and other government programs are generally dictated by those programs 
in determining charge rates for goods and services provided to our other customers  we evaluate several factors including cost and market competition 
we sometimes negotiate contract rates with third party providers such as insurance companies 
our reliance on government sponsored reimbursement programs makes us vulnerable to possible legislative and administrative regulations and budget cut backs that could adversely affect the number of persons eligible for such programs  the amount of allowed reimbursements or other aspects of the program  any of which could materially affect us 
in addition  loss of certification or qualification under medicare or medicaid programs could materially affect our ability to effectively market our services 
the following table sets forth our revenues from continuing operations derived from each major class of payor during the indicated periods by percentage of net revenues payor group year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  medicare medicaid and other government programs insurance and private pay 
table of contents medicare revenues are earned only in our vn segment where they account for of segment revenues 
historical changes in payment sources are primarily a result of changes in the types of customers we attract 
see government regulation and risk factors 
we will monitor the effects of such items and may consider modifications to our expansion and development strategy when and if necessary 
acquisitions the company has completed several acquisitions over the past two fiscal years and will continue to acquire other quality providers of medicare certified home health services 
we may consider acquisitions of businesses that provide health care services similar to those we currently offer in our personal care segment but we expect most of our acquisition activity to be focused on visiting nurse operations 
factors which may affect future acquisition decisions include  but are not limited to  the quality and potential profitability of the business under consideration  and our profitability and ability to finance the transaction 
acquisitions during on june   the company acquired the assets of the medicare certified home health agencies affiliated with florida based central florida health alliance cfha  a two hospital health care company system with home health branches in leesburg and the villages for a purchase price of million  consisting of million in cash and a million promissory note 
the cash portion of the transaction was funded from borrowings available on the company s existing senior credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na 
acquisitions during during the company acquired visiting nurse branch locations

apex s annual revenues were approximately million in 
table of contents competition  marketing and customers the visiting nurse industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
competitors include larger publicly held companies such as amedisys  inc nasdaqgs amed  gentiva health services  inc 
nasdaqgs gtiv  lhc group  inc nasdaqgs lhcg and numerous privately held multi site home care companies  privately held single site agencies and a significant number of hospital based agencies 
competition for customers at the local market level is very fragmented and market specific 
generally  each local market has its own competitive profile and no one competitor has significant market share across all our markets 
to the best of our knowledge  no individual provider has more than share of the national market 
we believe the primary competitive factors are quality of service and reputation among referral sources 
however  competitors are increasingly focusing attention on providing alternative site health care services 
we market our services through our site managers and marketing staff 
these individuals contact referral sources in their areas to market our services 
major referral sources include physicians  hospital discharge planners  offices on aging  social workers  and group living facilities 
we also utilize consumer direct sales  marketing and advertising programs designed to attract customers 
the personal care industry is likewise highly competitive and fragmented 
competitors include home health providers  senior adult associations  and the private hiring of caregivers 
we market our services primarily through our site managers  and we compete by offering a high quality of care and by helping families identify and access solutions for care 
government regulation overview the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document and proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
we expect government officials to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
we expect legislative changes intended to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of medicare and medicaid to continue 
such future changes may further impact reimbursement for our services 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
medicare rates on october   medicare implemented the prospective payment system pps and began paying providers of home health care at fixed  predetermined rates for services and supplies bundled into day episodes of home health care 
an episode of home health care spans a day period  starting with the first day a billable visit is furnished to a medicare beneficiary and ending days later 
if a patient is still in treatment on the th day a new episode begins on the st day regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day and ends days later 
the first day of a consecutive episode  therefore  is not necessarily the new episode s first billable visit 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods detailed below 
table of contents period base episode payment january  through december  january  through december  january  through december  january  through december  the actual episode payment rates  as presented in the table vary  depending on the home health resource groups hhrgs to which medicare patients are assigned and the per episode payment is typically reduced or increased by such factors as the patient s clinical  functional  and services utilization characteristics 
under pps for medicare reimbursement  we record net revenues based on a reimbursement rate that varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and other related factors 
we record net revenues as services are rendered to patients over the day episode period 
at the end of each month  a portion of our revenue is estimated for episodes in progress 
medicare reimbursement on an episodic basis  is subject to change if the actual number of therapy visits differs from the number anticipated at the start of care or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
our revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we recognize medicare revenue on an episode by episode basis during the course of each episode over its expected number of visits 
in october the centers for medicare medicaid services cms published regulations specifying medicare home health reimbursement rates for medicare rates for include a market basket update rate increase of plus a outlier policy adjustment less a case mix creep adjustment 
accordingly  medicare rates are about higher than in refer to the risk factors below  the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
medicaid reimbursement as shown in compensation for services above  approximately of our revenues were derived from state medicaid and other government programs  many of which currently face significant budget issues 
the financial condition of the medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate is cyclical and many may be expected from time to time to take actions or evaluate taking actions to control the rate of growth of medicaid expenditures 
among these actions are the following redefining eligibility standards for medicaid coverage redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made limiting reimbursement rate increases increased utilization of self directed care alternatives shifting beneficiaries from traditional coverage to medicaid managed care providers changing regulations under which providers must operate 
the actions that might be taken or considered are because the number of medicaid beneficiaries and their related expenditures are growing at a faster rate than the government s revenue 
medicaid is consuming a greater percentage of states budget 
this issue is exacerbated when revenues slow in a slowing economy 
we believe 
table of contents that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the states medicaid financing problems 
it is possible that actions taken by the state medicaid programs in the future could have a significant unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
permits and licensure many states require companies providing certain health care services to be licensed as home health agencies 
in addition  certain health care practitioners employed by us require state licensure and or registration and must comply with laws and regulations governing standards of practice 
the failure to obtain  renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely affect our business 
we believe we are currently licensed appropriately where required by the laws of the states in which we operate 
there can be no assurance that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations upon our activities which might adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
certificates of need certain states require companies providing health care services to obtain a certificate of need issued by a state health planning agency 
where required by law  we have obtained certificates of need from those states 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any certificates of need which may be required in the future if we expand the scope of our services or if state laws change to impose additional certificate of need requirements  and any attempt to obtain additional certificates of need will cause us to incur certain expenses 
other regulations a series of laws and regulations dating back to the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra and through the medicare prescription drug bill of have been enacted and apply to us 
changes in applicable laws and regulations have occurred from time to time since obra including reimbursement reductions and changes to payment rules 
changes are also expected to occur continuously for the foreseeable future 
as a provider of services under medicare and medicaid programs  we are subject to the medicare and medicaid anti kickback statute  also known as the fraud and abuse law 
this law prohibits any bribe  kickback  rebate or remuneration of any kind in return for  or as an inducement for  the referral of medicare or medicaid patients 
we may also be affected by the federal physician self referral prohibition  known as the stark law  which  with certain exceptions  prohibits physicians from referring patients to entities in which they have a financial interest or from which they receive financial benefit 
many states in which we operate have adopted similar self referral laws  as well as laws that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between health care providers  if such arrangements are designed to induce or to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider 
health care is an area of extensive and dynamic regulatory change 
changes in laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations can have a dramatic effect on our permissible activities  the relative costs associated with our doing business  and the amount and availability of reimbursement we receive from government and third party payors 
furthermore  we will be required to comply with applicable regulations in each new state in which we desire to provide services 
as a result of the health insurance portability and accountability act of and other legislative and administrative initiatives  federal and state enforcement efforts against the health care industry have increased dramatically  subjecting all health care providers to increased risk of scrutiny and increased compliance costs 
we are subject to routine and periodic surveys  audits and investigations by various governmental agencies 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws 
however  we are unable to predict what additional government regulations  if any  affecting our business may be enacted in the future  how existing or future laws 
table of contents and regulations might be interpreted or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations either in the markets in which we presently conduct  or wish to commence  business 
insurance programs and costs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self insured employee health program 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for the employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we are aware of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we currently carry professional and general liability insurance coverage for this exposure with no deductible 
prior to april  we carried coverage with a deductible per claim of  total premiums  excluding our exposure to claims and deductibles  for all our non health insurance programs were approximately  for the contract year ending march  on april   we completed our renewal for the contract year ending march  with total estimated premiums of  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate 
as part of our on going risk management and cost control efforts  we continually seek alternatives that might provide a different balance of cost and risk  including potentially accepting additional self insurance risk in lieu of higher premium costs 
executive officers see part iii  item of this form k for information about the company s executive officers 
employees and labor relations as of december  we had approximately  employees 
none of our employees are represented by a labor organization 
we believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory 

table of contents item a 
risk factors described below and elsewhere in this report are risks  uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business  results of operations  cash flow  liquidity or financial condition 
investing in our common stock involves a degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the following risks  as well as other information in this filing and the incorporated documents before investing in our common stock 
risks related to our industry health care reform efforts currently underway in congress the us congress has been pursuing a comprehensive reform of the us health care system since early in late  the us house of representatives and the senate passed separate measures either of which  if enacted  would reduce home health reimbursement rates 
due to recent political developments it is unclear if any attempts will be made to reconcile differences in the two bills  to pass either of the two bills or to start anew with new legislation  or whether comprehensive reform efforts will be abandoned entirely 
on february   the president announced his own proposal which we believe mirrors the senate plan as it relates to home healthcare 
should such legislation ultimately be passed by both houses of congress it would then be submitted to the president for his signature before becoming law 
in the event that comprehensive health care reform is not passed into law  the congress and the president could still enact legislation that could impact the company s reimbursement rates 
there can be no assurance that comprehensive health care reform  or other legislation impacting the company s reimbursement rates  in any form will or will not be passed into law 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict what impact the ultimate federal budget or the congress consideration of comprehensive health care reform or reimbursement rates might have on our financial condition  our results of operations or the realizability of the carrying amount of our assets  in particular intangible assets including goodwill 
we may be unable to take actions to mitigate any of whatever negative reimbursement changes might ultimately be enacted 
the reimbursement changes ultimately enacted could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial position 
further provisions of any ultimate health care reform may impact the health insurance benefits we currently offer or may be required to offer our employees which could also have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial position 
at this point  we are unable to predict what actions congress may take in passing health care reform or the changes to the federal budget for the implications on the potential budget for  which would actually be passed some time during  are even less predictable 
we can provide you with no assurance that the ultimate outcome of health care reform efforts and or the federal budget and resulting medicare reimbursement rates will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  our results of operation  the realizability of the carrying amounts of our intangible assets including goodwill or our financial condition 
further  we are unable to predict what effect  if any  such material adverse effect  if it were to occur  might have on our ability to continue to comply with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility and our ability to continue to access debt capital through that facility 
the current crisis in world wide economies and credit and financial markets may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition  as well as our ability to access credit and capital 
as widely reported  global capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme disruptions and turmoil for over months  including the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
this has resulted in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
while the 
table of contents ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  it may have a material adverse affect on the company 
the current crisis may cause budget deficits or other reductions in reimbursement by medicare  medicaid and other third party payors which may result in decreased revenue growth and a decrease in our profitability 
our contractors and suppliers may also be negatively impacted by these conditions and our ability to provide patient care at a lower cost may diminish and reduce our profitability 
the continuing disruption in the credit and capital markets may restrict our access to capital 
as a result  our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations and acquisitions may be constrained 
if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve  our results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our profitability depends principally on the level of government mandated payment rates 
reductions in rates  or rate increases that do not cover cost increases  may adversely affect our business 
we generally receive fixed payments from medicare for our services based on the level of care that we provide patients 
consequently  our profitability largely depends upon our ability to manage the cost of providing services 
although current medicare legislation provides for an annual adjustment of the various payment rates based on the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure category of the consumer price index  these medicare payment rate increases may be less than actual inflation or could be eliminated or reduced in any given year 
consequently  if our cost of providing services  which consists primarily of labor costs  is greater than the current medicare payment rate  our profitability would be negatively impacted 
if any of our agencies fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the medicare program  that agency could be terminated from the medicare program  which would adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability 
each of our home care agencies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the medicare program 
if any of our agencies fail to meet any of the medicare conditions of participation  that agency may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor 
if that agency then fails to institute a plan of correction to correct the deficiency within the correction period provided by the state surveyor  that agency could be terminated from the medicare program 
any termination of one or more of our home care agencies from the medicare program for failure to satisfy the program s conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenue and profitability 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  audits and investigations 
any changes to the laws and regulations governing our business  or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations  could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results 
the federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively 
the laws and regulations governing our operations  along with the terms of participation in various government programs  regulate how we do business  the services we offer  and our interactions with patients and the public 
these laws and regulations  and their interpretations  are subject to frequent change 
changes in existing laws and regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or regulations could reduce our profitability by increasing our liability  increasing our administrative and other costs  increasing or decreasing mandated services  forcing us to restructure our relationships with referral sources and providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
in addition  we are subject to various routine and non routine governmental reviews  audits  and investigations 
for example  we are in the process of complying with a civil subpoena from the united states department of health and human services office of inspector general we received in december the subpoena seeks the production of various business records relating to our visiting nurse operations in birmingham  alabama  which we acquired in july and which generated approximately of our consolidated revenues in due to the limited information we currently have about the nature and status of this matter and the preliminary posture of the request  we cannot predict the timing or eventual outcome of this matter 

table of contents violation of the laws governing our operations  or changes in interpretations of those laws  could result in the imposition of fines  civil or criminal penalties  the termination of our rights to participate in federal and state sponsored programs  and the suspension or revocation of our licenses 
if we become subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions are imposed on us  we might suffer a substantial reduction in profitability 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our success depends significantly on referrals from physicians  hospitals and other patient referral sources in the communities that our home care agencies serve  as well as on our ability to maintain good relationships with these referral sources 
our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer home care patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers 
our growth and profitability depend on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of home care by our referral sources and their patients 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets 
our loss of  or failure to maintain  existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably 
we are subject to federal and state laws that govern our financial relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers  including potential or current referral sources 
we are required to comply with federal and state laws  generally referred to as anti kickback laws  that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical services 
in addition to enacting anti kickback laws  some of the states in which we operate have enacted laws prohibiting certain business relationships between physicians and other providers of healthcare services 
we currently have contractual relationships with certain physicians who provide consulting services to our company 
many of these physicians are current or potential referral sources 
although we believe our physician consultant arrangements currently comply with state and federal anti kickback laws and state laws regulating relationships between healthcare providers  we cannot assure you that courts or regulatory agencies will not interpret these laws in ways that will implicate our physician consultant arrangements 
violations of anti kickback and similar laws could lead to fines or sanctions that may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may be subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims 
the services we offer involve an inherent risk of professional liability and related substantial damage awards 
on any given day  we have several hundred nurses and therapists and other direct care personnel driving to and from patients homes where they deliver medical and other care 
due to the nature of our business  we and the caregivers who provide services on our behalf may be the subject of medical malpractice claims 
these caregivers could be considered our agents  and  as a result  we could be held liable for their medical negligence 
we cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees 
we maintain malpractice liability insurance and are responsible for amounts in excess of the limits of our coverage 
delays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems 
our business is characterized by delays in reimbursement from the time we provide services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment for these services 
if we have information system problems or issues that arise with medicare  we may encounter delays in our payment cycle 
such a timing delay may cause working capital shortages 
working capital management  including prompt and diligent billing and collection  is an important factor in our results of operations and liquidity 
we cannot assure you that system problems  medicare issues or industry trends will not extend our collection period  adversely impact our working capital  or that our working 
table of contents capital management procedures will successfully negate this risk 
there are often timing delays when attempting to collect funds from medicaid programs 
we cannot assure you that delays in receiving reimbursement or payments from these programs will not adversely impact our working capital 
our industry is highly competitive 
our home health care agencies compete with local and regional home health care companies  hospitals  nursing homes  and other businesses that provide home nursing services  some of which are large established companies that have significantly greater resources than we do 
our primary competition comes from local companies in each of our markets  and these privately owned or hospital owned health care providers vary by region and market 
we compete based on the availability of personnel  the quality  expertise  and value of our services  and in select instances  on the price of our services 
increased competition in the future from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
some of our existing and potential new competitors may enjoy greater name recognition and greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
this may permit our competitors to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of services 
these competitors may undertake more far reaching and effective marketing campaigns and may offer more attractive opportunities to existing and potential employees and services to referral sources 
we expect our competitors to develop new strategic relationships with providers  referral sources  and payors  which could result in increased competition 
the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings  in combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors  could cause a decline in revenue or loss of market acceptance of our services or make our services less attractive 
additionally  we compete with a number of non profit organizations that can finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us 
we expect that industry forces will continue to have an impact on our business and that of our competitors 
in recent years  the health care industry has undergone significant changes driven by efforts to reduce costs  and we expect these cost containment measures to continue in the future 
frequent regulatory changes in our industry  including reductions in reimbursement rates and changes in services covered  have increased competition among home health care providers 
if we are unable to react competitively to new developments  our operating results may suffer 
a shortage of qualified registered nursing staff  physical therapists  occupational therapists and other caregivers could adversely affect our ability to attract  train and retain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs 
we rely significantly on our ability to attract and retain caregivers who possess the skills  experience  and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our patients 
we compete for personnel with other providers of home nursing services 
our ability to attract and retain caregivers depends on several factors  including our ability to provide these caregivers with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in any of these areas 
in addition  there are occasional shortages of qualified healthcare personnel in some of the markets in which we operate 
as a result  we may face higher costs of attracting caregivers and providing them with attractive benefit packages than we originally anticipated and  if that occurs  our profitability could decline 
finally  although this is currently not a significant factor in our existing markets  if we expand our operations into geographic areas where healthcare providers have historically unionized  we cannot assure you that the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements will not have a negative effect on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel 
generally  if we are unable to attract and retain caregivers  the quality of our services may decline  and we could lose patients and referral sources 

table of contents risks related to our business we depend on medicare for the largest portion of our revenues 
for the years ended december   and  we received  and  respectively  of our revenue from medicare 
further  the acquisitions completed by us in  and substantially increase our dependence on medicare reimbursement 
reductions in medicare reimbursement could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
such reductions in payments to us could be caused by administrative or legislative changes to the base episode rate  the elimination or reduction of annual rate increases based on medical inflation  the imposition by medicare of co payments or other mechanisms shifting responsibility for a portion of payment to beneficiaries  adjustments to the relative components of the wage index  changes to our case mix or therapy thresholds  or other adverse changes to the way we are paid for delivering our services 
our non medicare revenues and profitability also are affected by the continuing efforts of third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by lowering reimbursement rates  narrowing the scope of covered services  increasing case management review of services  and negotiating reduced contract pricing 
any changes in reimbursement levels from these third party payor sources and any changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue to maintain the current payor or revenue mix 
our reliance on government sponsored reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid makes us vulnerable to possible legislative and administrative regulations and budget cut backs that could adversely affect the number of persons eligible for such programs  the amount of allowed reimbursements or other aspects of the programs  any of which could materially affect us 
in addition  loss of certification or qualification under medicare or medicaid programs could materially affect our ability to effectively market our services 
we have a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately  and of our revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of connecticut  ohio and kentucky  respectively 
approximately of our revenues were derived from state medicaid and other government programs  many of which currently face significant budget issues 
the financial condition of the medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate is cyclical and many may be expected from time to time to take actions or evaluate taking actions to control the rate of growth of medicaid expenditures 
among these actions are the following redefining eligibility standards for medicaid coverage redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made limiting reimbursement rate increases increased utilization of self directed care alternatives shifting beneficiaries from traditional coverage to medicaid managed care providers changing regulations under which providers must operate states may be expected to address these issues because the number of medicaid beneficiaries and their related expenditures are growing at a faster rate than the government s revenue 
medicaid is consuming a greater percentage of states budgets 
this issue is exacerbated when revenues slow in a slowing economy 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the states medicaid financing problems 
it is possible  however  that the actions taken by the state medicaid programs in the future could have a significant unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents migration of our medicare beneficiary patients to medicare managed care providers could negatively impact our operating results 
historically  we have generated a substantial portion of our revenue from the medicare fee for service market 
under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of december mma  however  the united states congress allocated significant additional funds and other incentives to medicare managed care providers in order to promote greater participation in those plans by medicare beneficiaries 
if these increased funding levels have the intended result  the size of the potential medicare fee for service market could decline  thereby reducing the size of our potential patient population  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
our business plan calls for significant growth in our business over the next several years 
this growth will place significant demands on our management systems  internal controls  and financial and professional resources 
in addition  we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems  and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and to acquire additional agencies on favorable terms and to integrate and operate these agencies effectively 
if we are unable to do so  our future growth and operating results could be negatively impacted 
development 
we expect to continue to open agencies in our existing and new markets 
our new agency growth  however  will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain locations for agencies in markets where need exists  identify and hire a sufficient number of sales personnel and appropriately trained home care and other health care professionals  obtain adequate financing to fund growth  and operate successfully under applicable government regulations 
acquisitions 
we are focusing significant time and resources on the acquisition of home healthcare providers  or of certain of their assets  in targeted markets 
we may be unable to identify  negotiate  and complete suitable acquisition opportunities on reasonable terms 
we may incur future liabilities related to acquisitions 
should any of the following problems  or others  occur as a result of our acquisition strategy  the impact could be material difficulties integrating personnel from acquired entities and other corporate cultures into our business  difficulties integrating information systems  the potential loss of key employees or referral sources of acquired companies or a reduction in patient referrals by hospitals from which we have acquired home health care agencies  the assumption of liabilities and exposure to undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies  the acquisition of an agency with undisclosed compliance problems  the diversion of management attention from existing operations  difficulties in recouping partial episode payments and other types of misdirected payments for services from the previous owners  or an unsuccessful claim for indemnification rights from previous owners for acts or omissions arising prior to the date of acquisition 
effective january   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented a prohibition of the sale or transfer of the medicare provider agreement for any medicare certified home health agency that has been in existence for less than months or that has undergone a change of ownership in the last months 
this limitation may reduce the number of home health agencies that otherwise would have been available for acquisition and may limit our ability to successfully pursue our acquisition strategy 

table of contents we may require additional capital to pursue our acquisition strategy 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and additional borrowing capacity of approximately million 
based on our current plan of operations  including acquisitions  we cannot assure you that this amount will be sufficient to support our current growth strategies 
we cannot readily predict the timing  size  and success of our acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources  our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing 
in december  we filed a million shelf registration statement with the availability for the issuance of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities 
the registration statement became effective december   and on august   we entered into a distribution agreement to offer and sell from time to time up to  shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million through a distribution agent 
in  we issued  of our shares of common stock and as of december   a maximum of  shares remain available for sale subject to a maximum additional value limit of approximately million 
at some future point we may elect to issue additional equity or debt securities in conjunction with raising capital or completing an acquisition 
we cannot assure you that such issuances will not be dilutive to existing shareholders 
our business depends on our information systems 
our inability to effectively integrate  manage  and keep secure our information systems could disrupt our operations 
our business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing claims  reporting financial results  measuring outcomes and quality of care  managing regulatory compliance controls  and maintaining operational efficiencies 
these systems include software developed in house and systems provided by external contractors and other service providers 
to the extent that these external contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems  our operations could be negatively affected 
our agencies also depend upon our information systems for accounting  billing  collections  risk management  quality assurance  payroll  and other information 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability  or availability of our information systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading  and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
our acquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement  maintain  or expand our systems properly  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  regulatory problems  and increases in administrative expenses 
our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and patient data stored in our information systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems  or those of our providers or regulators  which could disrupt our operations or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented 
further  our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
a failure to restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  loss of electronically 
table of contents stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  possible liability and loss 
our clinical software system has been developed in house 
failure of  or problems with  our system could harm our business and operating results 
we have developed and utilize a proprietary clinical software system to collect assessment data  log patient visits  generate medical orders  and monitor treatments and outcomes in accordance with established medical standards 
the system integrates billing and collections functionality as well as accounting  human resource  payroll  and employee benefits programs provided by third parties 
problems with  or the failure of  our technology and systems could negatively impact data capture  billing  collections  and management and reporting capabilities 
any such problems or failures could adversely affect our operations and reputation  result in significant costs to us  and impair our ability to provide our services in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems may be substantial and could adversely affect our profitability 
we depend on outside software providers 
we depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating our business  some of which are provided by outside software providers 
these information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading  and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
if our providers are unable to maintain or expand our information systems properly  we could suffer from operational disruptions and an increase in administrative expenses  among other things 
our insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs 
we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self insured employee health program 
under our workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for our employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
however  we cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of such insurance  if any  nor can we assure you that any such claims  if successful and in excess of such limits  will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business or on our assets 
our insurance coverage also includes fire  property damage  and general liability with varying limits 
although we maintain insurance consistent with industry practice  we cannot assure you that the insurance we maintain will satisfy claims made against us 
in addition  as a result of operating in the home healthcare industry  our business entails an inherent risk of claims  losses and potential lawsuits alleging employee accidents that may occur in a patient s home 
finally  we cannot assure you that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates  in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms 
any claims made against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could damage our reputation and business 
we have established reserves for medicare and medicaid liabilities that may be payable by us in the future 
these liabilities may be subject to audit or further review  and we may owe additional amounts beyond what we expect and have reserved 
the company is paid for its services primarily by federal and state third party reimbursement programs  commercial insurance companies  and patients 
revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered 
appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
it is common for issues to arise related to medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 

table of contents we depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees 
our success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team  including our chairman and chief executive officer  william b 
yarmuth  and our other named executive officers 
we also depend upon the continued employment of the individuals that manage several of our key functional areas  including operations  business development  accounting  finance  human resources  marketing  information systems  contracting and compliance 
the departure of any member of our senior management team may materially adversely affect our operations 
our operations could be affected by natural disasters 
a substantial number of our agencies are located in florida  increasing our exposure to hurricanes and other natural disasters 
the occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could not only affect the day to day operations of our agencies  but also could disrupt our relationships with patients  employees and referral sources located in the affected areas 
in addition  any episode of care that is not completed due to the impact of a natural disaster will generally result in lower revenue for the episode 
we cannot assure you that hurricanes or other natural disasters will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations in the future 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders 
the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities  particularly securities of health care companies 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including our operating and financial performance  variances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  future sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur  investor perception of our business and our prospects  developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations  changes or proposed changes in health care laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations  or announcements relating to these matters  or general economic and stock market conditions in addition  the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of health care provider companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management team s attention as well as resources from the operation of our business 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the availability of those shares for future sale  could adversely affect our stock price and limit our ability to raise capital

moreover  as of december    shares of our common stock remained reserved for issuance pursuant to our incentive compensation plans and  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock to the public or the perception that substantial sales could occur 
these sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell common stock in the future to raise capital

any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  capital requirements  earnings  and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
our board of directors may use anti takeover provisions or issue stock to discourage control contests 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions or provisions that could have an anti takeover effect  including advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals 
these provisions  and others that the board of directors may adopt hereafter  may discourage offers to acquire us and may permit our board of directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us  even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in asc topic  segment reporting formerly sfas no 

our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or an hourly basis 
of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan emphasizes our vn operations 
our pc operations will help us maintain a level of diversification of reimbursement risk that we believe is appropriate 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  expand the significance of our visiting nurse  medicare based  home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers and through the startup of new agencies  and expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 
health care reform efforts currently underway in congress the us congress has been pursuing a comprehensive reform of the us health care system since early in late  the us house of representatives and the senate passed separate measures either of which  if enacted  would reduce home health reimbursement rates 
due to recent political developments it is unclear if any attempts will be made to reconcile differences in the two bills  to pass either of the two bills or to start anew with new legislation  or whether comprehensive reform efforts will be abandoned entirely 
on february   the president announced his own proposal which we believe mirrors the senate plan as it 
table of contents relates to home healthcare 
should such legislation ultimately be passed by both houses of congress it would then be submitted to the president for his signature before becoming law 
in the event that comprehensive health care reform is not passed into law  the congress and the president could still enact legislation that could impact the company s reimbursement rates 
independent of these legislative developments  on january  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented final regulations for medicare reimbursement for home health services which increased our medicare reimbursement rates for by about 
unless prospectively or retrospectively changed by legislative action  these new rates will remain in effect for the balance of there can be no assurance that comprehensive health care reform  or other legislation impacting the company s reimbursement rates  in any form will or will not be passed into law 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict what impact the ultimate federal budget or the congress consideration of comprehensive health care reform  or reimbursement rates  might have on our financial condition  our results of operations or the realizability of the carrying amount of our assets  in particular intangible assets including goodwill 
we may be unable to take actions to mitigate any of whatever negative reimbursement changes might ultimately be enacted 
the reimbursement changes ultimately enacted could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial position 
further provisions of any ultimate health care reform may impact the health insurance benefits we currently offer or may be required to offer our employees which could also have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial position 
it is reasonable to expect that the proposed changes  if enacted  might have a more immediate and negative impact on those providers generating lower margins than us  with more leverage relative to earnings than us  with less capital resources than us  or with less ability to adapt their operations 
certain aspects of the proposed legislation appear to align with the report of the medicare payment advisory commission medpac 
medpac suggests  in connection with its recommendation for a rebasing or recalculation of home health reimbursement rates for  that such change may result in some agencies exiting medicare 
based on this and our own interpretation of the potential implications of such a rebasing we believe that the proposal  if enacted  may result in a contraction of the number of home health providers 
in the event of such a contraction in the number of providers  we believe the surviving providers may benefit from a higher rate of admissions growth than would have otherwise occurred 
those surviving providers may earn incremental margins on those higher admissions that may serve to offset a portion of the rate reduction from the medicare program 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting such higher admissions 
it is also reasonable to expect that the proposed rate cuts  if enacted  will present additional opportunities for us to make acquisitions of other providers at valuations and on terms that are attractive to us and enable us to spread our segment and unallocated corporate overhead expenses across a larger business base 
however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making such acquisitions 
at this point  we are unable to predict what actions congress may take in passing health care reform or changes to the federal budget for the implications on the potential budget for  which would actually be passed some time during  are even less predictable 
we can provide you with no assurance that the ultimate outcome of health care reform efforts and or the federal budget and resulting medicare reimbursement rates will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  our results of operation  the realizability of the carrying amounts of our intangible assets including goodwill or our financial condition 
further  we are unable to predict what effect  if any  such material adverse effect  if it were to occur  might have on our ability to continue to comply with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility and our ability to continue to access debt capital through that facility 
we are currently formulating actions intended to mitigate or otherwise offset some of the negative effects of the proposed reimbursement changes 
these actions may include any or all of the following 
table of contents attempting to increase our revenues by investing more resources in sales and marketing activities to drive admission growth  establishing startup branch operations to expand our service territories  and acquisitions of underperforming providers with strong referral relationships  attempting to reduce our costs by developing a more efficient delivery model  increasing the productivity standards for our staff  limiting or eliminating the growth in wage rates  limiting or reducing the size of our work force  closing unprofitable branch operations and accelerating our efforts to evaluate the use of various technological approaches to the delivery of patient care  evaluating the potential implications of health care reform proposals on our employee benefit plans and possible changes we may need to make to our plans should the reform proposals become law  and potentially other actions we deem appropriate 
although we will attempt to mitigate or otherwise offset the negative effect of health care reform on our reimbursement and our employee benefit plans  there can be no assurance that our actions will ultimately be cost effective or prove successful 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectability of accounts receivable  insurance reserves  litigation  goodwill  intangibles and contingencies on an on going basis 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements 
receivables and revenue recognition we recognize revenues when patient services are provided 
our receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be their net realizable values

it is common for issues to arise related to medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 
we report accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and adjustments 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience  business and economic conditions and reimbursement trends 
medicare reimbursement on an episodic basis  is subject to change if the actual number of therapy visits differs from the number anticipated at the start of care or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
our revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by 
table of contents the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we recognize medicare revenue on an episode by episode basis during the course of each episode over its expected number of visits 
insurance programs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self insured employee health program 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for the employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we are aware of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we currently carry professional and general liability insurance coverage for this exposure with no deductible 
we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets are stated at fair value at the time of acquisition and goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized 
we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly sfas no 

the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of the related reporting units using a combined market approach guideline company and similar transaction method and income approach discounted cash flow analysis 
these models are based on our projections of future revenues and operating costs and are reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital as well as the weighted average cost of capital of other market participants of and a terminal growth rate of 
a basis point change in either assumption either individually or in the aggregate would not result in any impairment of our goodwill balances 
as of december   we completed our impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
future medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates  admissions  volumes  our liquidity and other factors may have a significant impact on our business and required the recognition of impairment charges in the future 
accounting for income taxes as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of approximately  the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately  of current deferred tax assets and approximately  of long term deferred tax liabilities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based upon our estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation allowance was based in large part on our history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
we have considered the above factors in reaching our conclusion that it is

on august   we entered into a distribution agreement with jp morgan securities inc according to the provisions of this agreement  we may offer and sell from time to time up to  shares of common stock 
table of contents having an aggregate offering price of up to million through jp morgan  as distribution agent 
sales of stock will be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the nasdaq global select market at market prices  or as otherwise agreed between us and jp morgan 
under the terms of this agreement  we also may sell shares of common stock to jp morgan as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of the sale 
any sale of shares of common stock to jp morgan as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate agreement that would be entered into between us and jp morgan 
this agreement provides us the right  but not the obligation  to sell shares of common stock in the future  at prices we deem appropriate 
we retain at all times complete control over the amount and timing of each sale  and we will designate the maximum number of shares of common stock to be sold through jp morgan  on a daily basis or otherwise as we and jp morgan agree 
jp morgan will then use commercially reasonable efforts to sell  as our distribution agent and on our behalf  all of the designated shares of common stock 
we may instruct jp morgan not to sell shares of common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us in any such instruction 
either we or jp morgan may suspend the offering of shares of common stock pursuant to the agreement upon proper notice and subject to other conditions

borrowings other than letters of credit under the credit facility are at either the bank s prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  currently or libor plus a margin ranging from to  currently 
the margin for prime rate or libor borrowings is determined by the company s leverage 
borrowings under the agreement are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all tangible and intangible assets of the company  and all existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company as guarantors

borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions

the four day increase in days revenue outstanding accounted for approximately million while the balance of million resulted from organic revenue growth 
the increase in accounts payable and prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to our increased volume of business 
the cash used in investing activities is primarily due to the apex home healthcare acquisition million completed in march and the patient care acquisition million in august net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the million stock offering in april and million of additional borrowings on our credit facility

we may consider acquisitions of businesses that provide health care services similar to those we currently offer in our personal care segment but we expect most of our acquisition activity to be focused on visiting nurse operations 
factors which may affect future acquisition decisions include  but are not limited to  the quality and potential profitability of the business under consideration  potential regulatory limitations and our profitability and ability to finance the transaction 
acquisitions during during we acquired visiting nurse branch locations

we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december   which benefit our third party insurer administrators for our self insurance programs 
the amount of such insurance program letters of credit is subject to negotiation annually upon renewal and may vary in the future based upon such negotiation  our historical claims experience and expected future claims 
it is reasonable to expect that the amount of the letter of credit will increase in the future  however  we are unable to predict to what degree 

table of contents we currently have no obligations related to acquisition agreements 
however  we periodically seek acquisition candidates and may reasonably be expected to enter into acquisitions in the future 
general and professional liability 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial

we carry insurance coverage for this exposure with no deductible 
health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact our reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as us 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
we cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting our business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in our existing or future markets 
discontinued operations we follow the guidance in asc topic  property  plant and equipment  and  when appropriate  reclassify operating units closed  sold  or held for sale out of continuing operations and into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during we had one personal care facility that met the criteria to be reclassified as discontinued operations and during we had no facilities that met the criteria to be reclassified as discontinued operations

table of contents ebitda ebitda is defined as income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  net interest expense and income taxes 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity 
management routinely calculates and communicates ebitda and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance  measure leverage capacity and debt service ability  and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value 
ebitda is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to ebitda in thousands year ended december  net income from continuing operations add back interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization amortization of stock based compensation earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda from continuing operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had no outstanding amounts on its revolving credit facility and  therefore  a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would have no impact on annual pre tax earnings due to higher interest expense
