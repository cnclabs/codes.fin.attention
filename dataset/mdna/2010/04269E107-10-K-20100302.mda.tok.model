item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a clinical stage biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of innovative cancer therapeutics 
our mission is to produce novel medicines with differentiated mechanisms of action that target the specific biological pathways implicated in a wide range of cancers 
we employ novel technologies such as our arqule kinase inhibitor platform akip to design and develop drugs that have the potential to fulfill this mission 
our products and programs span a continuum of research and development ranging from drug discovery to advanced clinical testing 
they are based on our understanding of biological processes that lead to the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells  combined with our ability to generate product candidates possessing certain pre selected  drug like properties and designed to act specifically against cancer cells 
we believe that these qualities  when present from the earliest stages of product development  increase the likelihood of producing safe  effective and marketable drugs 
our lead product is arq  a non adenosine triphosphate atp competitive inhibitor of the c met receptor tyrosine kinase c met 
c met is a promising target for cancer therapy  as evidence suggests that plays a key roll in cancerous cell proliferation  tumor spread  new blood vessel formation and drug resistance 
our ongoing phase clinical trial program with arq encompasses six tumor types  including non small cell lung cancer  c met associated soft tissue sarcomas  pancreatic adenocarcinoma  hepatocellular carcinoma  germ cell tumors and colorectal cancer 
we believe the trials within the phase program for arq offer the potential for proof of principle data that can be generated in one or more indications beginning in early through  as well as the potential for fast to market regulatory pathways in certain indications 
we have licensed commercial rights to arq for human cancer indications to daiichi sankyo co  ltd 
daiichi sankyo in the us  europe  south america and the rest of the world  excluding japan and certain other asian countries  where we have licensed commercial rights to kyowa hakko kirin co  ltd 
kyowa hakko kirin 
our agreements with these partners provide for possible future milestone payments  royalties on product sales  and development funding  in addition to significant payments that we have already received 
our proprietary pipeline is directed toward molecular targets and biological processes with demonstrated roles in the development of human cancers 
the most advanced candidate in this pipeline is arq  an inhibitor of the eg kinesin motor protein that is in phase clinical testing 
additional pipeline assets include arq and arq  activators of the cell s dna damage response mechanism that we plan to develop further on a partnered basis 
we are also pursuing pre clinical development of an inhibitor of the b raf kinase that is in toxicology testing leading to a potential investigational new drug ind submission in our drug design efforts are focused primarily on the akip  which we are using to generate compounds designed to inhibit kinases without competing with adenosine triphosphate atp for binding to the target kinase 
atp is a chemical found in all living cells and is involved in a variety of physiological processes 
we have assessed akip s potential to target multiple kinases in oncology and other therapeutic areas  and we are generating and validating compounds that inhibit these kinase targets 
with the akip technology  we have discovered and optimized a series of small molecule inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors that are in pre clinical development  with the potential submission of an ind for a lead product candidate in we are also pursuing a drug discovery collaboration with daiichi sankyo that utilizes the capabilities of the akip technology to discover compounds that inhibit two kinase targets in the field of oncology 
we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million from inception through december  we expect research and development costs to increase during the course of  due to clinical 
table of contents testing of our lead product candidates 
we recorded a net loss for   and expect a net loss for our revenue consists primarily of development funding from our alliances with daiichi sankyo and kyowa hakko kirin 
revenue and expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors  notably the timing and extent of our cancer related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials 
on december   roche notified the company of its intention not to exercise its option to license the ef program 
roche s rights to develop and commercialize potential drugs under the agreement terminated as of december  as a result  the company will not receive any further payments under this agreement 
on december   we entered into a license  co development and co commercialization agreement with daiichi sankyo to conduct research  clinical trials and commercialization of arq in human cancer indications in the us  europe  south america and the rest of the world  excluding japan  china including hong kong  south korea and taiwan  where kyowa hakko kirin has exclusive rights for development and commercialization 
the agreement provides for a million cash upfront licensing payment from daiichi sankyo to us  which we received in december  and an additional million in potential development and sales milestone payments 
we and daiichi sankyo will share equally the costs of phase and phase clinical studies  with our share of phase costs payable solely from milestone and royalty payments by daiichi sankyo 
upon commercialization  we will receive tiered  double digit royalties from daiichi sankyo on net sales of arq commensurate with the magnitude of the transaction 
we retain the option to participate in the commercialization of arq in the us revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through december on november   we entered into a research collaboration  exclusive license and co commercialization agreement with daiichi sankyo under which we will apply our proprietary technology and know how from our akip platform for the discovery of therapeutic compounds that selectively inhibit certain kinases 
the agreement defines two such kinase targets  and daiichi sankyo will have an option to license compounds directed to these targets following the completion of certain pre clinical studies 
the agreement provides for a million upfront payment  which we received in november  research support payments for the first two years of the collaboration  licensing fees for compounds discovered as a result of this research  milestone payments related to clinical development  regulatory review and sales  and royalty payments on net sales of compounds from the collaboration 
we retain the option to co commercialize licensed products developed under this agreement in the us revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency adjusted performance model with an estimated performance period through november on april   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with kyowa hakko kirin to develop and commercialize arq  a small molecule  selective inhibitor of the c met receptor tyrosine kinase  in japan and parts of asia 
a million portion of an upfront licensing fee was received by the company under this agreement in the first quarter of  and an additional million in upfront licensing fees was received on may  the agreement includes million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from kyowa hakko kirin to arqule  including the million cash upfront licensing payments 
in february  we received a million milestone payment from kyowa hakko kirin 
upon commercialization  arqule will receive tiered royalties in the mid teen to low twenty percent range from kyowa hakko kirin on net sales of arq kyowa hakko kirin will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain asian countries  consisting of japan  china including hong kong  south korea and taiwan 
in addition to the upfront and possible regulatory milestone payments totaling million  the company will be eligible for future milestone payments based on the achievement of certain levels of net sales 
the company will recognize the payments  if any  as revenue in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
as of december   the company has not recognized any 
table of contents revenue from these sales milestone payments  and there can be no assurance that it will do so in the future 
revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through april in may  we entered into an agreement with daiichi sankyo related to potential future milestones and royalties for our akip collaboration  under which we could receive up to million in potential development and sales milestone payments for each product selected for clinical development 
upon commercialization of a licensed product  we would also receive tiered  double digit royalties on its net sales 
liquidity and capital resources december  increase decrease to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities short term marketable securities long term notes payable working capital december  in millions cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities 
our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices and laboratories  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies and materials  and professional fees 
the sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services 
in  our net use of cash was primarily driven by the difference between cash receipts from our collaborators  and payments for operating expenses which resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
cash flow from investing activities 
our net cash used in investing activities of million in was comprised of net purchases of marketable securities of million  partially offset by acquisitions of fixed assets of million 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities include ustreasury bill funds  money market funds  commercial paper fully guaranteed by the fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  commercial paper  and us federal and state agency backed certificates  including auction rate securities that have investment grade ratings 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of 
table of contents expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
auction rate securities are structured with short term interest reset dates of generally less than days  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to twenty eight days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par value 
if auction rate securities fail an auction  due to sell orders exceeding buy orders  the funds associated with a failed auction would not be accessible until a successful auction occurred  a buyer was found outside the auction process  the underlying securities matured or a settlement with the underwriter is reached 
beginning in the first quarter of and continuing throughout  certain auction rate securities failed at auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
on november   the company accepted an offer the offering by ubs ag ubs of certain rights put option to cause ubs to purchase auction rate securities owned by the company 
the repurchase rights were offered in connection with ubs s obligations under settlement agreements with the us securities and exchange commission and other federal and state regulatory authorities 
the offering  the settlement agreements  and the respective rights and obligations of the parties  including a release by the company of ubs and its employees and agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages relating to ubs s marketing and sale of auction rate securities  are described in a prospectus issued by ubs dated october  as a result of accepting the offering  the company received a put option from ubs to repurchase the securities at par value at any time during the period from june  through july   if the company s auction rate securities have not previously been sold by the company or by ubs on its behalf 
the company has accounted for the put option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the company has classified its auction rate securities as trading securities reflecting the company s intent to exercise the put option during the period june  to july  the net increase in value of our put option and auction rate securities totaling million for the year ended was recorded as a gain in other income expense in the statement of operations 
the net decrease in value of our put option and auction rate securities totaling million for the year ended was recorded as a loss in other income expense in the statement of operations 
our marketable securities portfolio as of december  and includes million at cost and million at cost  respectively  invested in auction rate securities all of which were associated with auctions that failed subsequent to february  on july   we entered into a collateralized  revolving credit line agreement for up to million with ubs bank usa the facility 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in the auction rate securities held by us in an account with ubs financial services inc  an affiliate of ubs bank usa 
the credit line is uncommitted and any outstanding balance  including interest  is payable upon demand 
variable rate advances under the facility currently bear interest at a rate not to exceed the weighted average interest rate that we earn from the underlying auction rate securities securing the loan 
the facility replaced the million standard margin loan agreement with ubs financial services inc that we entered into on may  in july  we drew down million under the facility 
the funds are available for research and development efforts  including clinical trials  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in accordance with the offering by ubs  the million borrowed under the facility remains payable on demand  however  if ubs bank usa should exercise its right to demand repayment of any portion of the company s indebtedness prior to the date the company can exercise its repurchase rights other than for reasons specified in the prospectus  ubs and certain of its affiliates will arrange 
table of contents for alternative financing on terms and conditions substantially the same as those contained in the facility 
if alternative financing cannot be established  then ubs or one of its affiliates will purchase the company s pledged auction rate securities at par 
in light of the above arrangement with our auction rate securities and the financial impact of our two agreements with daiichi sankyo  including a cumulative million in cash and upfront payments received in the quarter ended december  and certain anticipated milestone and cost sharing provisions  we expect that our available cash and cash equivalents  including cash received under our auction rate security credit line agreement as described above  together with cash from operations and investment income  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements through at least the end of cash flow from financing activities 
our net cash used by financing activities of million in the year ended december  was from the million payment on our notes payable  partially offset by additional cash inflow of million from stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily from the million we borrowed under our collateralized  revolving credit line agreement as described above and the million we borrowed under a margin loan agreement with another financial institution collateralized by million of our auction rate securities 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in was comprised primarily of the proceeds from our june stock offering  wherein we sold million shares of common stock at per share for aggregate net proceeds of million after commissions and offering expenses 
during july  the company received net proceeds of million when the underwriters exercised a portion of their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of common stock 
stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases provided additional cash inflow of million 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  unanticipated required capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product 
it is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial  economic and market conditions  and due to global capital and credit market conditions or for other reasons  we may be unable to raise capital when needed  or on terms favorable to us 
if necessary funds are not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some of our development programs  potentially delaying the time to market for any of our product candidates 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years notes payable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total 
table of contents purchase obligations are comprised primarily of outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments to license certain intellectual property to support the company s research efforts 
interest on notes payable is variable and is excluded from the table above 
notes payable of million currently bear interest at a rate not to exceed our weighted average auction rate security coupon rate and million currently bear interest at libor plus basis points 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies 
for additional information  please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
research and development revenue research and development revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development agreements 
the terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable upfront payments  funding for research and development  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations 
research and development payments from our collaborators are recognized as research and development revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model 
under this model  when payments are earned  revenue is immediately recognized on a pro rata basis in the period we achieve the milestone based on the time elapsed from inception of the agreement to the time the milestone is earned over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement 
thereafter  the remaining portion of the milestone payment is recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated development period under the agreement 
this estimated development period may ultimately be shorter or longer depending upon the outcome of the development work  resulting in accelerated or deferred recognition of the development revenue 
royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned 
the costs associated with satisfying research and development contracts are included in research and development expense as incurred 
sale leaseback accounting on may   we completed a transaction to sell our woburn headquarters facility and two parcels of land in exchange for a cash payment of million  net of commissions and closing costs 
simultaneously with that sale  we entered into an agreement to lease back the entire facility and the associated land 
the lease was subsequently amended on june  the amended lease has a term of ten years with an average annual rental rate of million 
we also have options to extend the lease term for up to an additional ten years 
we are applying sale leaseback accounting to the transaction and are treating the lease as an operating lease 
as a result of this transaction  we reduced our net fixed assets by million  representing the net book value of the assets sold on the date of the lease amendment  and realized a gain on the sale of million  which has been deferred and will be amortized over the initial ten year lease term as a reduction in rent expense 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options 
table of contents include the exercise price of the award  expected option term  expected volatility of our stock over the option s expected term  risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and the expected annual dividend yield 
we believe that the valuation technique and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of our stock option grants 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we consider all highly liquid investments purchased within three months of original maturity date to be cash equivalents 
we invest our available cash primarily in us treasury bill funds  money market funds  commercial paper fully guaranteed by the fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  commercial paper  and us federal and state agency backed certificates  including auction rate securities that have investment grade ratings 
auction rate securities are structured with short term interest reset dates of generally less than days  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to twenty eight days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par value 
we generally classify our marketable securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each consolidated balance sheet date 
the company classifies its investments as either current or long term based upon the investments contractual maturities and the company s ability and intent to convert such instruments to cash within one year 
we report available for sale investments at fair value as of each balance sheet date and include any unrealized gains and  to the extent deemed temporary  unrealized losses in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income expense in the statement of operations 
certain of our marketable securities are classified as trading securities and any changes in the fair value of those securities are recorded as other income expense in the statement of operations 
we determine on a quarterly basis the fair value of our investment portfolio 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary using available evidence regarding our investments 
in the event that the cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends  our intent to sell the investment and if it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and a new cost basis in the security is established 
results of operations the following are the results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue increase decrease to to in millions research and development revenue as compared to research and development revenue in is comprised of revenue from the daiichi sankyo development and research collaboration agreements entered into in and the kyowa hakko kirin exclusive license agreement 
the increase in is primarily due to revenue from daiichi sankyo 
revenue of million was recognized in from the roche alliance agreement that was terminated in december 
table of contents as compared to research and development revenue in is comprised of revenue from the kyowa hakko kirin exclusive license agreement  the daiichi sankyo development and research collaborations agreements entered into in  and the roche alliance agreement 
the increase in is primarily due to revenue from kyowa hakko kirin 
following the termination of the roche alliance agreement in  million of deferred revenue was recognized in  in addition to the million recurring annual amount 
no further revenues will be recognized under the collaboration with roche 
research and development increase decrease to to in millions research and development as compared to the million decrease in research and development expense in is primarily due to i a decrease of million in outsourced costs related to the phase and clinical programs with arq and arq  ii a decrease of million in other outsourced preclinical and product development costs  iii a million increase in outsourced costs related to the phase and clinical programs for arq  and iv a million decrease in personnel and related costs 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  up from employees at december  as compared to the million decrease in research and development expense in is primarily due to i a decrease of million in outsourced costs related to the phase and clinical programs with arq and arq  ii a decrease of million in connection with the company s sponsored research agreement with boston biomedical institute bbi that was completed in  iii a million increase in outsourced costs related to the phase and clinical programs for arq iv an increase of million in other outsourced preclinical and product development costs  and v million in additional personnel and related costs  including million incurred in conjunction with the separation agreement of our prior chief medical officer 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  down from employees at december  overview our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with pre clinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license  and sponsored research fees paid to third parties and depreciation of associated laboratory equipment 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our portfolio of oncology programs 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects  and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis 

table of contents the expenses incurred by us to third parties for pre clinical and clinical trials in the current quarter and since inception of our lead clinical stage program were as follows in millions oncology program current status year ended december  program to date c met program arq phase our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous pre clinical studies for safety  toxicology  and efficacy 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for the pre clinical and clinical development of each of these types of products to take nine years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patients  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term product related adverse events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad pipeline of products 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and future financial success do not substantially depend on any one product 
to the extent we are unable to build and maintain a broad pipeline of products  our dependence on the success of one or a few products increases 
our strategy includes entering into alliance arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaboration agreements with daiichi sankyo and kyowa hakko kirin 
in the event that third parties have control over the clinical trial process for a product  the estimated completion date would be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our products will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our oncology programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows 
table of contents from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our oncology programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into appropriate collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our product development strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
general and administrative increase decrease to to in millions general and administrative compared to general and administrative expense in decreased by million principally due to million of stock compensation costs incurred in resulting from senior management transitions that did not recur in  a decrease of million in personnel and related costs and lower professional fees of million 
general and administrative headcount was at december   compared to at december  compared to general and administrative expense increased million in primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense resulting from senior management transitions 
general and administrative headcount was at december   compared to at december  restructuring in december  we announced a major restructuring of our operations in order to realign our workforce and expedite the transition towards becoming a drug discovery company 
the restructuring actions included closing our facility in redwood city  california 
the facility related accrual  which represents the difference between our lease obligation for the california facility and the amount of sublease payments it will receive under its sublease agreement  will be paid out through activities against the restructuring accrual in and were as follows in thousands balance as of december  provisions payments balance as of december  facility related total restructuring accrual balance as of december  provisions payments balance as of december  facility related total restructuring accrual
