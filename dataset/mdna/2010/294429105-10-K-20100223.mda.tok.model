at december   there was outstanding million under the senior credit facility  which is included in long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet  million in cp  and no amounts under our canadian credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on our cp  all with maturities less than days  was per annum 
at december   a total of million was available under our committed credit facilities 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed rate debt and was effectively variable rate debt 
our variable rate debt  consisting of cp  borrowings under our credit facilities and our five year senior notes due against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates  generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers 
the interest rates reset periodically  depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements 
at december   interest rates on our variable rate debt ranged from to 
borrowing and repayment activity 
net short term borrowings repayments primarily represent activity under our cp program  as well as activity under our canadian short term revolving credit agreement 
net repayments borrowings under long term revolving credit facilities relates to activity on our senior credit facility 
we primarily borrow under our cp program  when available 
the increase in net short term borrowings repayments in primarily reflects the net issuance of million of cp notes since december   offset by the repayment of million under our canadian credit facility 
in  the activity in this balance primarily reflects the net repayment of million of the balance outstanding on our cp notes at december   offset by the increase of million in borrowings under our canadian credit facility 
in  net borrowing activity under our cp program was partially offset by net repayments under our trade receivables backed revolving credit facility  which we elected to terminate on november  the increase in net repayments borrowings for under long term revolving credit facilities represents the repayment of borrowings outstanding at december   under our senior credit facility as we increased our use of cp to fund our capital needs 
in  the net borrowing activity under long term revolving credit facilities primarily represents our pay down of million of cp outstanding at december  from cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility to lower the average cost of our debt and due to the adverse conditions in the cp market 
in  the net borrowing activity under long term revolving credit facilities primarily represents our refinancing of the million principal amount relating to our senior notes which matured in november in  we purchased million principal amount of our outstanding ten year senior notes due for million and million principal amount of our outstanding debentures due for million 
during  we purchased million principal amount of the ten year senior notes due for million 
on november   we issued million principal amount of  five year senior notes in an underwritten public offering 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to repay amounts outstanding under our cp program  a portion of which was used to finance our fourth quarter acquisitions 
in conjunction with our sale of five year senior notes  we entered into five year interest rate swaps  designated as fair value hedges  which convert the debt s fixed interest rate to a variable rate 
on june   we issued million principal amount of  ten year senior notes and million principal amount of  thirty year senior notes in underwritten public offerings 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes to reduce the outstanding amount of our cp 
in conjunction with the sale of the and senior notes  we entered into cash flow hedges on million and million notional amount  respectively  of ten year and thirty year treasury notes 
these hedges were settled in cash on june and   respectively  the date the senior notes were sold  requiring a cash payment by us of million and million  respectively 
there were no material proceeds from the issuance of long term debt during debt covenants 
our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  our senior credit facility and canadian credit facility each require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than to  and limit the amount of subsidiary debt 
our leverage ratio was at december  none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and  as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt  however  our senior notes  discussed above  contain change in control provisions 
if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard poor s  or s p  and moody s investors service  or moody s  below an investment grade rating within days of such change of control or notice thereof  then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
credit ratings 
credit ratings reflect an independent agency s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity 
the ratings reflect many considerations  such as the nature of the borrower s industry and its competitive position  the size of the company  its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company s cash flows to changes in the economy 
the two largest rating agencies  s p and moody s  use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings 
the highest quality rating for long term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s p and moody s  respectively 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
long term ratings of bbb and baa or better by s p and moody s  respectively  reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade 
at december   the long term ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa  which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december  a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities  and could limit  or in the case of a significant downgrade  preclude our ability to issue cp 
if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels  we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt 
in addition  the market s demand for  and thus our ability to readily issue  new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

treasury stock purchases dividends paid to equifax shareholders dividends paid to noncontrolling interests proceeds from exercise of stock options excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december   and were as follows under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors  we purchased million  million  and million common shares on the open market during the twelve months ended december   and  respectively  for million  million and million  respectively  at an average price per common share of  and  respectively 
at december   the company had million remaining for stock repurchases under the existing board authorization 
as of february   we had acquired an additional million shares for million since december  during the twelve months ended december   and  we paid cash dividends to equifax shareholders of million  million and million  respectively  at per share for all periods 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time 
some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 
payments due by in millions total less than year to years to years thereafter debt including capitalized lease obligation operating leases data processing  outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations other long term liabilities interest payments the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling million and fair value adjustments of million at december  total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments 
our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment  which include the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions  and certain administrative functions 
these agreements expire between and these long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension  postretirement and other compensation related plans  some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments 
in the table above  we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations  as such required funding amounts beyond have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance 
during january  we made a million contribution to fund our us retirement income plan 
for future interest payments on variable rate debt  which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers  we used the variable rate in effect at december  to calculate these payments 
our variable rate debt at december   consisted of cp  borrowings under our credit facilities and our five year senior notes due against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates 
future interest payments related to our senior credit facility and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december  through their respective maturity dates  assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time 
the variable portion of the rate at december  was between and for substantially all of our variable rate debt 
future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates 
this table excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
a potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to computer sciences corporation  or csc  if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to the option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within days after the exercise of the option 
we estimate that if the option had been exercised at december   the price range would have been approximately million to million 
this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business  current market conditions and other factors  all of which are subject to constant change 
therefore  the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate 
our agreement with csc  which expires on july   also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of csc while the agreement is in effect 
if csc were to exercise its option  or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option  then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding 
we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt and or equity financing 
however  the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors  including credit market conditions  the state of the equity markets  general economic conditions  our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition 
off balance sheet transactions we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
pursuant to the terms of the industrial revenue bonds  we transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with costs of million and million  as of december  and  respectively  to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development 
the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds 
these fixed assets are still recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company 
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit  performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business 
the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december   and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less 
guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units 
the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december  benefit plans prior to december   we had one non contributory qualified retirement plan covering most us salaried employees the equifax inc pension plan  or eipp  a qualified retirement plan that covered us salaried employees the us retirement income plan  or usrip who terminated or retired before january  and a defined benefit plan for most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan  or crip 
on december   the plan assets and obligations of the eipp were merged with the usrip 
the usrip remained as the sole us qualified retirement plan 
at december   the usrip met or exceeded erisa s minimum funding requirements 
in january  we made a contribution of million to the usrip 
during the twelve months ended december  and  we made contributions of million and million  respectively  to the eipp 
we also contributed million to the crip during the twelve months ended december  the equifax employee benefits trust contributed million to the eipp upon dissolution of the trust in in the future  we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions  depending on certain circumstances  including market conditions and liquidity needs 
we believe additional funding contributions  if any  would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs  which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities  available cash and cash equivalents  and our credit facilities 
for our non us  tax qualified retirement plans  we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations 
for the non qualified supplementary retirement plans  we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants  but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 
for additional information about our benefit plans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
seasonality we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams 
revenue generated from the work number business unit within the talx operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year 
revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions  most commonly the second and third calendar quarters 
effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equifax s operating results are not materially affected by inflation  although inflation may result in increases in the company s expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and profitability 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of non us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored 
we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates  although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 
recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap 
this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements 
to account for each of these elements separately  the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer  and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements 
judgments and uncertainties each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables 
these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value  concluding when the element will be delivered  and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 
for certain contracts containing multiple elements  the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their relative fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting or fair value is not known for any undelivered elements  arrangement consideration may only be recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer 
in addition  the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
effects if actual results differ from assumptions we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 
we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future  we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance or trends  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
we have ten reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services  direct marketing services  europe  latin america  canada consumer  north america personal solutions  north america commercial solutions  the work number  tax management services and talent management services 
effective september   the consumer information solutions and consumer financial marketing services reporting units were aggregated into a single reporting unit to better reflect the economic similarities and customer overlap of the two businesses 
prior to aggregation  we assessed the recoverability of goodwill for consumer information solutions and consumer financial marketing services separately and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
the goodwill balance at december   for our ten reporting units was as follows december  in millions consumer information solutions including mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services direct marketing services europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions the work number tax management services talent management services total goodwill judgments and uncertainties in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit s business enterprise value 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and long term revenue growth rates  operating margins for each reporting unit  discount rates  foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges 
the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for benchmark companies 
we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks  participate in similar markets  provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly 
the companies we use as benchmarks are outlined in our competition discussion included in item i of this report  including experian group limited  the dun bradstreet corporation  acxiom corporation  and harte hanks  inc data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information 
consumer information solutions  our largest reporting unit  as well as europe and latin america  have benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type and scope 
the work number and tax management services share a different set of benchmark companies  notably adp and paychex inc  as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units 
valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit s operating result with the comparable companies information 
in addition to these financial considerations  qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple 
the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit s fair value 
we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units 
this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach  with of the value coming from the income approach 
we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 
we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test 
growth assumptions the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance  the details of which are described in our management s discussion analysis of operating performance 
additionally  we consider the impact that known economic  industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts  as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives  client service and retention standards  and cost management programs 
at the end of the forecast period  the long term growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally to based on management s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit  as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product  or gdp  inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 
as a result of the economic downturn experienced in and  and the resultant decline in revenue experienced in certain of our business units  in completing our impairment testing at september   we projected revenue and cash flow to be lower than levels for our direct marketing services reporting unit  which continues to be impacted by reduced mailing volumes 
we anticipate only modest revenue growth in for our other reporting units based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units  such as continued demand for employment verification services and unemployment claims management in the work number and tax management services reporting units 
the anticipated revenue growth  however  is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth 
the long term forecast used to conduct the impairment testing was significantly lower in the aggregate than the long term forecast that was developed in the long term forecast does not anticipate meaningful recovery of the global economy until later in although we do not expect consolidated revenue or cash flow to improve meaningfully until later in  we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units 
discount rate assumptions we utilize a weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 
to calculate the wacc  the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures 
the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the risk free interest rate  beta  equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit 
the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company s tax rate 
for the annual goodwill impairment evaluation  the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units ranged from to 
because of assigned market premiums  discount rates are lowest for reporting units  such as consumer information solutions  whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to the maturity of the market they serve  their position in that market and other macroeconomic factors 
where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition  or participation in less stable geographic markets than the united states  such as our latin america reporting unit  the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit 
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above  incorporating the related projections and assumptions 
an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity 
the estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of september  as a result  no goodwill impairment was recorded 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions  therefore  in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
for example  an increase in the discount rate and decline in the cumulative cash flow projections of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
ultimately  future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for the company s reporting units as of september   ranged from approximately to 
we have experienced declines in fair value excess for the majority of our reporting units since the date of our last impairment analysis december  due to declines in actual and projected financial performance resulting from significant adverse economic conditions 
while no impairment was noted in our impairment tests as of september   our reporting units with the smallest fair value excess may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration in economic conditions and could become impaired in future periods if anticipated levels of forecasted earnings are not achieved 
of the reporting units having a significant amount of goodwill  the calculated percentage excess in the work number reporting unit  at approximately  is less than our other reporting units  in part  due to the fact that the work number was acquired in may as part of our acquisition of talx corporation 
the work number revenues have been strong historically  having grown at a double digit compound annual growth rate since the date of acquisition  therefore revenue growth is expected to continue for each of the years used in the preparation of the discounted cash flows 
the actual growth rate for the work number would have to decline to a compounded rate of growth  with all other factors held constant  for the reporting unit s fair value to drop below its carrying value 
however  in the event that the revenue growth rate was to decline  management would take action to preserve operating margins 
if the fair value dropped below carrying value  we would compare the carrying value of the goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill to determine if a goodwill impairment charge would become necessary 
the reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess fair value over carrying value is our talent management services business 
this reporting unit has been impacted by reduced hiring activity among key clients and  as a result  we have lowered our revenue growth projections 
in addition  we are projecting lower margins due  in part  to our plan to reinvest in the business by expanding our customer portfolio 
the decrease in projected revenues coupled with lower projected margins has resulted in a decline in the fair value of this reporting unit 
while no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of september   if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecasted or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit  there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and may possibly result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of  thus no impairment testing was updated as of december  effect if actual results differ from assumptions we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business 
we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable  reasonably possible or remote 
judgments and uncertainties we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability in our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated settlement costs 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible  but not probable  we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency 
our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies 
however  if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates  we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 
income taxes we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid 
we periodically assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities 
we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations 
regularly  we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 
judgments and uncertainties we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income  mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions  and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and  if so  the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements 
we regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances  such as changes in tax law  interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law 
these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense 
settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash 
at december   million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of which it is reasonably possible that up to million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 
pension and other postretirement plans we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  salary growth  expected return on plan assets  interest cost and mortality and retirement rates 
actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 
judgments and uncertainties we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
we determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality  fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date 
discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
we use a publicly published yield curve to develop our discount rates 
the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period  from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class  as provided by our external investment advisor 
in setting the long term expected rate of return  management considers capital markets future expectations and the asset mix of the plan investments 
prior to  the us pension plans investment returns were  and over three  five and ten years  respectively 
the returns exceeded the s p returns for similar periods of time primarily due to an asset allocation strategy where large allocations to alternative asset classes hedge fund of funds  private equity  real estate and real assets provided consistently higher returns with a low correlation to equity market returns 
these returns historically demonstrate a long term record of producing returns at or above the expected rate of return 
however  the dramatic adverse market conditions in skewed the traditional measures of long term performance  such as the ten year average return 
the severity of the losses  approximately negative  makes the historical ten year average return a less accurate predictor of future return expectations 
in  the investment returns were approximately  reflecting a partial recovery of the losses 
our weighted average expected rate of return declined from in to approximately for primarily related to the us retirement income plan which declined due to our migration to a lower risk investment strategy  with increased allocation to lower risk lower return asset classes  as well as the current forecast of expected future returns for our asset classes  which is lower than the prior year 
the expected long term rate of return is calculated on the market related value of assets 
we are allowed to use an asset value that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets over a period up to five years 
we have elected to smooth asset gains and losses on our pension and postretirement plans over the five year period 
the market related value of our assets was million at december  we do not expect our net periodic benefit cost  which includes the effect of the market related value of assets  to be materially different than our cost 
annual differences  if any  between the expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
we generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all of the participants are inactive 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 
adjusting our expected long term rate of return at december  by basis points would change our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
adjusting our weighted average discount rate at december  by basis points would change our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to hedge certain of these exposures 
we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do transact business in other currencies  primarily the british pound  the canadian dollar  the brazilian real  the chilean peso and the euro 
for most of these foreign currencies  we are a net recipient  and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
we are required to translate  or express in us dollars  the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year 
we record the resulting translation adjustment  and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income  as a component of our shareholders equity 
other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates  although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 
for the year ended december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
for the year ended december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
a stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for and interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate  long term senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings  as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate 
we attempt to achieve the lowest all in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt  and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt 
at december   our weighted average cost of debt was and weighted average life of debt was years 
at december   of our debt was fixed rate  and the remaining was variable rate 
occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt would have increased our interest expense by approximately million 
based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt  we have material exposure to interest rate risk 
in the future  if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variable rate debt  we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt  as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt  can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors
