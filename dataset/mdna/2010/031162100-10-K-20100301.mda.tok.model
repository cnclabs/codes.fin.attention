table of contents effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash 
as required by this new standard  we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt 
under this method of accounting  the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately 
the equity components of our convertible notes  including our convertible notes  convertible notes and modified convertible notes  are included in common stock and additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification  as applicable 
the reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non cash interest expense 
this results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms

overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to assist the reader in understanding amgen s business 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our results of operations discussed in md a are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
we are the largest independent biotechnology medicines company 
we discover  develop  manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses 
we concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology 
our mission is to serve patients 
we operate in one business segment human therapeutics 
therefore  our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and various us and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business 
government authorities in the united states and in other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products and our ongoing r d activities 
the regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies  in particular the fda  to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products  which may lead to fewer products being approved by the fda or other regulatory bodies  delays in receiving approvals or additional safety related requirements or restrictions on the use of our products  including expanded safety labeling  required risk management activities  including a rems  and or additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of pmcs  pmrs or a pharmacovigilance program 
this is increasingly true of new therapies with novel mechanisms of action 
while these therapies may offer important benefits and or better treatment alternatives  they may also involve a relatively new or higher level of scientific complexity and  therefore  generate increased safety concerns 
most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government or private payer healthcare programs  which are placing greater emphasis on cost containment  including requiring that the economic value of products be clearly demonstrated 
governments may regulate access to  prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies 
worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare 
table of contents providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures 
therefore  sales of our principal products have and will continue to be affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third party payers  including government and private insurance plans  and administration of those programs 
additionally  ongoing healthcare reform efforts may also have a significant impact on our business 
for example healthcare reform  focused on expanding healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans and reducing the rate of increase in the costs of healthcare  remains a priority for president obama  us congress and a number of states 
developments in this area have been highly dynamic and difficult to predict 
as recently as february   president obama released a new proposal for healthcare reform which includes a combination of provisions from both the senate and house of representatives bills passed in late certain healthcare reform proposals being considered  which may or may not be adopted into law  could restrict the coverage and reimbursement of our products by medicare  medicaid and other government programs reduce the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition and or require additional healthcare reform costs be borne by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies at this time  we cannot predict which or whether any reform measures will be adopted into law 
we primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care  nephrology and inflammation 
our principal products include aranesp  epogen  neulasta  neupogen and enbrel all of which are sold in the united states 
enbrel is marketed under a co promotion agreement with pfizer in the united states and canada 
our international product sales consist principally of european sales of aranesp  neulasta and neupogen 
for additional information about our products  their approved indications and where they are marketed  see item business marketed products and selected product candidates 
our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year  including wholesaler and customer buying patterns  both of which fluctuate around holidays  and contract driven customer buying 
these factors can periodically result in higher us wholesaler distributor inventory levels in the united states  and therefore higher product sales 
we did not experience as large of an increase in wholesaler inventory levels in the fourth quarter of as in the prior year 
worldwide product sales for the year ended december  were billion  representing a decrease of compared to us product sales for the year ended december  were billion compared to billion in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease in us product sales was largely attributable to a decline in aranesp sales primarily reflecting the negative impact of a product safety related label change that occurred in august combined sales of our other products in the united states in increased compared to as increased epogen sales in largely offset the decline in enbrel sales 
this decrease in enbrel sales primarily reflects the unfavorable change in wholesaler inventories resulting from an approximate million wholesaler inventory build in related to the shift of enbrel to a wholesaler distribution model 
international product sales were relatively unchanged at billion for the year ended december  international product sales for were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate changes of million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  international product sales for the year ended december  increased 
this increase in international product sales is primarily due to the launches of vectibix  mimpara and nplate into our existing international markets and the expansion of neulasta and neupogen into new international territories 
although changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales  the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales are partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure  primarily with respect to the euro 

table of contents our operating expenses for the year ended december  declined approximately million  or  over of which approximately one half of this reduction was attributable to lower legal settlements and restructuring and related costs 
in addition  cost of sales declined in principally due to improved operating efficiencies and lower sales volume  partially offset by a less favorable product mix 
our r d expenses in also declined primarily due to lower clinical trial costs due to the completion of certain late stage registrational studies for denosumab and vectibix 
these decreases in our operating expenses were partially offset by a slight increase in our sg a expenses primarily due to increased promotional expenses  including spending for activities in advance of our anticipated launch of prolia 
this reduction in operating expenses also reflects  in part  our continuing efforts to maintain control over discretionary expenditures 
for the year ended december   our net income was billion  or per share on a diluted basis  reflecting increases of and  respectively  compared to the growth in our net income principally reflects our reduced operating expenses  discussed above  and a reduction in our provision for income taxes primarily due to favorable income tax settlements of approximately million and increased manufacturing and profits in puerto rico  which are taxed under an incentive grant 
our eps also benefited from a reduction in our weighted average shares used to compute diluted eps resulting from our stock repurchase program  including million shares repurchased in at a total cost of billion 
our financial condition remains strong 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregated billion  our total debt outstanding was billion and our stockholders equity aggregated billion 
in addition  our cash flow from operations for the year ended december  aggregated billion  representing a increase over the prior year 
capital expenditures for were approximately million  which represents a decrease from million in due to improved productivity and efficiency in our capital program 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december   billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations 
if these funds were repatriated for use in our us operations  we would be required to pay additional us federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates 
looking forward  we believe that our business will continue to face various regulatory  reimbursement and competitive challenges 
in particular  our esa products  aranesp and epogen  will continue to be impacted by regulatory developments  such as the rems  which has been recently approved by the fda  and recent or potential future product label changes  including any that may result from the advisory committee meeting proposed by the fda to be held in to re evaluate the use of esas in ckd 
in the united states  we rely in large part on the reimbursement of our products through government programs such as medicare and medicaid 
reimbursement challenges may result from the medcac meeting scheduled for march  to examine currently available evidence on the use of esas to manage anemia in patients who have ckd and the provisions of the cms proposed rule to implement a bundling prospective payment system for esrd 
in addition  the outcome of the proposed healthcare reform in the united states is very much uncertain at this time 
further  certain of our products will continue to face increasing competitive pressure  including our marketed products in the united states  in particular enbrel as well as from biosimilar and other products in europe which compete with aranesp  neulasta and neupogen 
we also have various opportunities to grow our business in the future  primarily due to our late stage product candidate  denosumab 
we continue to work with the fda regarding our bla for prolia 
on february   we announced that the fda has evaluated the content of our complete response submission for prolia in the treatment of pmo  which we submitted on january   and classified it as a class resubmission 
with the class designation  the fda set a corresponding pdufa action date of july  additionally  in december  the chmp announced a positive opinion for the marketing authorization for prolia for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures 
furthermore  we announced positive study results from three phase denosumab trials in the treatment of bone metastases that will form the basis of the clinical evidence package for denosumab in advanced cancer  which will be submitted to regulatory authorities later 
table of contents in we also expect the results in of an additional phase study to evaluate denosumab in patients with non metastatic prostate cancer to prevent bone metastases 
in addition  international expansion into emerging markets will also be an important opportunity for growth 
results of operations product sales for the years ended december   and  worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change aranesp epogen neulasta neupogen enbrel sensipar other total product sales total us total international total product sales product sales are influenced by a number of factors  some of which may impact sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others  including demand  third party reimbursement availability and policies  government programs  regulatory developments or guidelines  clinical trial outcomes  clinical practice  contracting and pricing strategies  wholesaler and end user inventory management practices  patient population growth  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  new product launches and indications  expansion into new countries  competitive products  product supply and acquisitions 
in addition  general economic conditions may effect  or in some cases amplify  certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales 
see item business marketed products and selected product candidates for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications 
aranesp for the years ended december   and  total aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change aranesp us aranesp international total aranesp us aranesp sales for the year ended december  decreased 
us sales of aranesp in benefited from certain changes in accounting estimates related to product sales return reserves 
excluding the positive impact of these changes in accounting estimates  us sales of aranesp decreased approximately compared to the year ended december  this decrease was principally driven by a decline in demand reflecting the negative impact  primarily in the supportive cancer care setting  of a product safety related label change which occurred in august and a low single digit decrease in the average net sales price 
in addition  the decline in sales also reflects both a decline in the segment and a slight loss of segment share 

table of contents international aranesp sales for year ended december  decreased  due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended december   excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes of approximately million  international aranesp sales remained unchanged 
the decrease in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  reflects the negative impact on demand  primarily in the supportive cancer care setting  of physician conformance to regulatory and reimbursement developments which principally occurred in the second half of  additional product label changes which occurred in  and to a lesser extent  loss of segment share 
the decline in demand was partially offset by an increase in the average net sales price 
in addition  us sales of aranesp for the year ended december  benefited from a slight change in an accounting estimate related to product sales return reserves 
the regulatory and reimbursement developments negatively impacting sales  included i the loss of aranesp for use in the treatment aoc following the reported results of our aoc phase study in february  ii various esa product safety related label changes in the united states during and and iii the cms ncd issued in july  which significantly restricted medicare reimbursement for use of aranesp in chemotherapy induced anemia cia and which we believe has also negatively impacted aranesp use in cia for patients covered by private insurance plans 
the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which positively impacted sales growth by approximately million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  international aranesp sales decreased 
this decrease reflects dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all esas in europe  which resulted in an overall decrease in the esa market 
in addition to other factors mentioned in the product sales section above  future aranesp sales will be dependent  in part  on such factors as regulatory developments  including the rems for our esas  which has been recently approved by the fda  or other risk management activities undertaken by us or required by the fda or other regulatory authorities  the esa product label changes reflecting certain results of our treat study treat label changes  the proposed fda advisory committee meeting in to re evaluate the use of esas to treat anemia in patients with ckd  future product label changes  including those we are currently discussing with regulatory authorities  reimbursement developments  including those resulting from the cms medcac meeting in march to examine currently available evidence on the use of esas to manage anemia in patients who have ckd  government s and or third party payer s reaction to regulatory developments  including the rems for our esas  the treat label changes and future product label changes  changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the basis for reimbursement by the federal and state governments  including medicare and medicaid  cost containment pressures by third party payers  including governments and private insurance plans  our ability to maintain worldwide segment share and differentiate aranesp from current and potential future competitive therapies or products  including j j s epoetin alfa product marketed in the united states and certain other locations outside of the united states and other competitors products outside of the united states  including biosimilar products that have been launched  proposed healthcare reform in the united states

epogen for the years ended december   and  total epogen sales were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change epogen us epogen sales for the year ended december  increased  primarily due to an increase in demand 
the increase in demand was principally due to patient population growth  increased dose utilization and an increase in the average net sales price 
the decrease in epogen sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in demand  reflecting a decline in the average net sales price 
the increase in demand resulting from patient population growth was offset by a decline in dose utilization in certain settings 
the decline in dose utilization was related to various esa product safety related label changes during and and the cms revision to its emp  which became effective january  we believe that the emp implementation significantly impacted physician behavior resulting in declines in dosing trends  as particularly noted in the quarter of implementation 
however  this dose decline subsequently moderated throughout in addition to other factors mentioned in the product sales section above  future epogen sales will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement developments  including those resulting from changes in reimbursement rates or changes in the basis for reimbursement by the federal and state governments  including medicare and medicaid  such as the cms proposed rule to implement the bundled prospective payment system  which becomes effective in  for dialysis services  drugs and biologicals furnished for treatment of esrd that are currently billed separately  the federal government s reaction to regulatory developments  including the rems for our esas  which has been recently approved by the fda  and future product label changes  the cms medcac meeting in march to examine currently available evidence on the use of esas to manage anemia in patients who have ckd  cost containment pressures from the federal and state governments on healthcare providers

for the year ended december   excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes of approximately million  
table of contents international neulasta neupogen sales increased 
the increase in demand was primarily due to the continued conversion from neupogen to neulasta and expansion into new international territories 
the increase in us neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december  primarily reflects an increase in demand for neulasta driven by an increase in the average net sales price partially offset by a slight decline in units sold 
the increase in international neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december  reflects increased demand principally driven by continued conversion from neupogen to neulasta as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which positively impacted the growth in combined international sales by million

table of contents related to a shift of enbrel to a wholesaler distribution model  partially offset by an increase in demand 
the increase in demand was driven by a mid single digit increase in the average net sales price partially offset by a decline in units sold due to share declines as a result of competitive activity 
enbrel continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments 
enbrel sales growth for the year ended december  reflects higher demand principally due to increases in the average net sales price 
enbrel sales were also favorably impacted by approximately million due to a change in our distribution model for enbrel 
previously  enbrel was shipped directly to pharmacies 
however  beginning in the three months ended march   we commenced using a wholesaler distributor model  similar to our other marketed products 
also  enbrel sales growth for the year ended december  was affected by share declines in the rheumatology and dermatology segments in the united states compared to the prior year due to increased competitive activity

amortization of certain acquired intangible assets amortization of certain acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the immunex acquisition 
for the year ended december   amortization expense also included million related to the impairment of a non enbrel related intangible asset previously acquired in the immunex acquisition 
write off of acquired in process research and development in accordance with the accounting standards for business combinations  prior to january   the fair value of acquired ipr d projects  which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition  were immediately expensed 
in  we wrote off million and million of acquired ipr d related to the acquisitions of alantos and ilypsa  respectively 
the alantos ipr d amount is related to an orally administered treatment for type ii diabetes that  at the date of acquisition  was in phase a clinical trials 
the ilypsa ipr d amount is related to a phosphate binder that  at the date of acquisition  was in phase clinical trials for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ckd patients on hemodialysis 
we used the income method to determine the estimated fair values of acquired ipr d  which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs 
these success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted at success rates of for the alantos product candidate and for the ilypsa product candidate 
the incremental r d expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approval for the alantos and ilypsa product candidates are immaterial 
the above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize  as estimated 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates are our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials  our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs 
we are not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals  and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective 
consequently  the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr d may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition 
we are continuing to develop the product candidate acquired in the alantos acquisition 
we have reviewed data from recently completed phase and clinical trials for amg  the product candidate acquired in the ilypsa acquisition 
the results were consistent with what is likely required for registration of a phosphate binding therapy 
however  in the context of our overall development portfolio  the company will be reviewing other options for the commercialization of this investigational product 
in addition  in  we wrote off acquired ipr d related to the acquisition of abgenix 
the ipr d amount was primarily related to the rights which we did not own pursuant to our agreement with abgenix to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab and related to a royalty that we would have owed to abgenix with respect to future sales of denosumab as a result of using certain of abgenix s patented technologies in the development of this product candidate see item business marketed products and selected product candidates 
the elimination of the royalty on potential future sales of denosumab did not result in us incurring 
table of contents any incremental r d expenses 
panitumumab was abgenix s fully human monoclonal antibody which  at acquisition  was in phase clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of cancer 
the incremental r d expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the various indications of panitumumab were estimated at the time of acquisition at approximately million and would be incurred through and there have been no significant changes in these estimates 
at the date of acquisition  we intended to develop panitumumab for treatment of various types of cancer 
in  panitumumab received fda approval for the treatment of mcrc after disease progression on  or following  fluoropyrimidine  oxaliplatin and irinotecan containing chemotherapy regimens and is marketed under the trademark vectibix 
in december  the european commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for vectibix as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with egfr expressing mcrc with non mutated wild type kras genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens 
this conditional approval is reviewed annually by the chmp  and in december we agreed as a condition of the renewal of approval to conduct an additional clinical trial in the existing approved indication 
the conditional approval was granted again in december we are continuing to develop or are evaluating plans to develop vectibix in all of the remaining indications we had intended at the date of acquisition 
however  since the acquisition  there have been several events that have affected the development plans for vectibix and because of these developments  our expected time to obtain regulatory approvals for the remaining indications has been delayed and the expected cost to obtain necessary approvals has increased compared to our original expectations

income taxes our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for decreased over primarily due to i the favorable resolution of certain prior years matters with tax authorities  ii higher profits and manufacturing in puerto rico  which are taxed under an incentive grant  and iii a tax benefit from adjustments to previously established deferred taxes arising from changes in california tax law enacted in and effective for subsequent periods 
the resolution of prior years tax matters recognized in the year ended december  reduced the effective tax rate by 
our effective tax rate for remained relatively unchanged from although the effective tax rate benefited from the favorable resolution of certain income tax examinations  this benefit was substantially offset by the write off of nondeductible acquired ipr d costs  resulting in a comparable effective tax rate between the two years

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard which amends guidance regarding consolidation of variable interest entities to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity 
this standard also replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
additionally  this standard requires any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity to make ongoing assessments of whether it has a controlling financial interest in the variable interest entity and to provide enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in the variable interest entity 
this standard is effective for us beginning january  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued a new accounting standard which amends guidance on accounting for revenue arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element of goods and or services 
this standard addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables and removes the previous separation criteria that objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any undelivered item must exist for the delivered item to be considered a separate unit of accounting 
this standard also addresses how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each deliverable 
finally  this standard expands disclosures related to multiple element revenue arrangements 
this standard is effective for us beginning january  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
additionally  the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon terms or amounts for some obligations 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the long term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments

to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a libor based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note 
we used an interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps 

table of contents purchase obligations primarily relate to i our long term supply agreements with third party manufacturers  which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity  ii r d commitments including those related to clinical trials for new and existing products  iii capital expenditures  iv open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business and v our agreement with international business machines corporation ibm  which we entered into on october   for certain information systems infrastructure services 
the term of the agreement is five years with three one year renewals  at our option  for a total of up to eight years 
the cost to us for the initial five year term  is estimated to be million  included in the table above is million for the remaining obligation 
the estimated aggregate additional cost of the three one year renewal options not included in the table above is approximately million 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events 
long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits utbs net of federal tax benefits on state taxes and related accrued interest and penalty totaling approximately billion at december  are not included in the table above because  due to their nature  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities 
as of december   we do not have any liabilities for utbs classified as current liabilities 
in addition to the above table  we are contractually obligated to make potential future success based development  regulatory and commercial milestone payments in conjunction with collaborative agreements we have entered into with third parties 
these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and  given the nature of these events  it is unclear when  if ever  we may be required to pay such amounts 
as payment of these amounts is not considered probable  these contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
further  the timing of any future payment is not reasonable estimable 
individually  future payment of any amounts under these arrangements is not expected to be material in any one reporting period 
as of december   the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under all such arrangement is approximately billion 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product sales  sales deductions and returns revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates  wholesaler chargebacks  cash discounts and other deductions collectively  sales deductions and returns  which are established at the time of sale 

table of contents we analyze the adequacy of our sales deductions accruals each quarter 
amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results 
the following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets regarding sales deductions in millions rebates chargebacks cash discounts other deductions total balance as of january  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  for the years ended december   and  total sales deductions were  and of gross product sales 
included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior year sales based on changes in estimates 
such amounts represent less than of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for each of the three years ended december  in late we began shifting our discount structure as a component of broader contracting revisions to be more heavily weighted toward fixed prices to healthcare providers reflected as chargebacks in the table above instead of rebates  resulting in a corresponding reduction in rebates and an increase in chargebacks  as noted in the table above 
in the united states  we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers  such as physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers  hospitals and pharmacies 
products we sell in the eu are principally distributed to hospitals and or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product is sold 
we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using data from our wholesalers and other third parties and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels generally two to three weeks given end user demand 
accordingly  historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns 
accruals for sales deductions are primarily based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns 
sales deductions are substantially product specific and  therefore  for any given year  can be impacted by the mix of products sold 
rebates earned by healthcare providers in the united states may include performance based offers  such as attaining contractually specified segment share or other performance based measures 
as a result  the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate s to be earned over a contractual period 
these rebates totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on our recent experience  changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods 
these changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period 
a change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in would have had an impact of approximately million on our product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers 
when the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices  the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers 
the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers 
these chargebacks from wholesalers totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability 
product returns returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product  when appropriate 
historically  sales return provisions have been insignificant  amounting to less than of gross product sales 
furthermore  changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant 
inventories produced in preparation for product launches the company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches when the related product candidates are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
in connection with the decision to capitalize such inventory  we evaluate among other factors any identified risks or concerns with respect to the product candidate s safety and efficacy  the status of related discussions with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial success  including the existence of current or anticipated competitive products and any reimbursement concerns 
in addition  we evaluate any risks associated with the manufacturing of the product candidate as well as considering the remaining shelf life of the inventory in relation to the expected launch date 
upon capitalization  we continue to monitor any changes in these factors 
in the event of any significant negative developments  we may be required to impair previously capitalized costs 
at december   we had capitalized approximately million of inventory costs related to our late stage product candidate  prolia 
in the united states  prolia is currently being reviewed by the fda for use in the treatment of pmo in women 
on february   we announced that the fda has evaluated the content of our complete response submission for prolia in the treatment of pmo  which we submitted on january   and classified it as a class resubmission 
with the class designation  the fda set a corresponding pdufa action date of july  in addition in december  the chmp announced a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of prolia for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures  and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures 
if approved by the european commission  we would receive marketing authorization for prolia in all eu member states 
the timing of actual launch dates would vary by country based on reimbursement authority approval of pricing which could follow the ema approval by many months 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes based on pretax income  applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
the amount of utbs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances  such as significant amendments to existing tax law  new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or 
table of contents resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties  where appropriate  related to utbs in income tax expense 
certain items are included in the company s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements 
such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities are either i a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or ii an expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on the tax return  but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements 
our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states based on our projected cash flow  working capital and long term investment requirements of our us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable us and state marginal income tax rates which could materially impact our future effective tax rate 
our operations are subject to the tax laws  regulations and administrative practices of the united states  us state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business 
significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
for example  substantial reform of us tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes  contractual disputes  governmental investigations and class action suits 
certain of these proceedings are discussed in note  contingencies and commitments to the consolidated financial statements 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies 
while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items  one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a global biotechnology company with operations in various countries 
we are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business 
to reduce certain of these risks  we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits  requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance  as we deem appropriate 
in addition  we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer 
we also enter into various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program 
we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has led to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors 
short term interest rates on us treasury instruments have declined considerably while other short term rates have fluctuated in excess of historical norms 
as a result  in the discussion that follows  we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points from those at december  and similarly  over this same period there has been extraordinary 
table of contents volatility in the currency markets  and we have consequentially assumed a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of december  and interest rate sensitive financial instruments our investment portfolio of available for sale debt securities at december  and was comprised primarily of us treasury securities  obligations of us government agencies and fdic guaranteed bank debt  corporate debt securities  mortgage and asset backed securities  money market mutual funds  and other short term interest bearing securities  principally comprised of commercial paper 
the fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a basis point change in interest rates 
applying a duration model  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates at december  and would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates 
in addition  a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
as of december   we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of billion and a fair value of billion 
as of december   we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of billion and a fair value of billion 
our outstanding debt at december  and was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt 
changes in interest rates would  however  affect the fair values of fixed rate debt 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at december   would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at december   would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date 
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  which qualify and have been designated as fair value hedges  for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
these derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a libor based floating rate coupon over the life of the respective note 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  and would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
foreign currency sensitive instruments our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately the euro  as a result of the sale of our products in foreign markets 
increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses 
to further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations  we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts 
we enter into forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of december   we had open forward and options contracts  primarily euro based  with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
as of december   we had open forward and options contracts  primarily euro based  with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
as of december   the net unrealized losses and at december  the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material 
with regard to forward and option contracts that were open at december   a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately million on this date and  in the ensuing year  a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately million 
with regard to contracts that were open at december   a hypothetical adverse 
table of contents movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of approximately million on this date and  in the ensuing year  a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately million 
also at december  and  we had open forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million  respectively  that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
these contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at december  and with regard to forward contracts that were open at december  and a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december  and would not have had a material impact on fair value on these dates or would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions or on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset 
market price sensitive instruments as of december  and  we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments  which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio at december  and was not material 
counterparty credit risks our financial instruments  including derivatives  are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement 
we attempt to mitigate this risk through credit monitoring procedures
