we manage our business as three separate operational segments exploration and production  marketing  gathering and compression midstream  and service operations  which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and trucking operations 
we refer you to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for  and and our assets as of december   and executive summary we are the second largest producer of natural gas in the united states 
we own interests in approximately  producing oil and natural gas wells that are currently producing approximately bcfe per day  of which is natural gas 
our strategy is focused on discovering  acquiring and developing conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves onshore in the us  primarily in our big natural gas shale plays the barnett shale in the fort worth basin of north central texas  the haynesville and bossier shales in the ark la tex area of northwestern louisiana and east texas  the fayetteville shale in the arkoma basin of central arkansas  the marcellus shale in the northern appalachian basin of west virginia  pennsylvania and new york and the eagle ford shale in south texas 
we also have substantial operations in the granite wash plays of western oklahoma and the texas panhandle regions as well as various other plays  both conventional and unconventional  in the mid continent  appalachian basin  permian basin  delaware basin  south texas  texas gulf coast and ark la tex regions of the us we have recently announced that we are extending our strategy to apply the horizontal drilling expertise we have gained in our natural gas shale plays to unconventional oil reservoirs 
we expect to begin increasing our production of oil and natural gas liquids in in new developing unconventional oil plays  particularly in the granite wash and eagle ford 
chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of tcfe and ended the year with tcfe  an increase of tcfe  or 
during  we replaced bcfe of production with an estimated tcfe of new proved reserves  for a reserve replacement rate of 
reserve replacement through the drillbit was tcfe  or of production  including bcfe of downward revisions resulting from changes to previous estimates and bcfe of downward revisions resulting from lower natural gas prices using the average month price in compared to the spot price as of december  during  we acquired bcfe of estimate proved reserves and divested bcfe of estimated proved reserves 
chesapeake continued the industry s most active drilling program in and drilled  gross net operated wells and participated in another gross net wells operated by other companies 
the company s drilling success rate was for company operated wells and for non operated wells 
also during  we invested billion in operated wells using an average of operated rigs and million in non operated wells using an average of non operated rigs for total drilling  completing and equipping costs of billion 
since  chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold million net acres and d seismic million acres in the us we are currently using operated rigs and non operated rigs to further develop our inventory of approximately  net drillsites  which represents more than a year inventory of drilling projects 

table of contents business strategy our exploration  acquisition and development activities require us to make substantial operating and capital expenditures 
our current budgeted drilling capital expenditures  net of drilling carries  are billion to billion in and billion to billion in we anticipate directing approximately of the drilling capital expenditure before drilling carries during and to our big shale plays 
during  our exploration and development costs were significantly lower than costs as a result of a significant decrease in drilling activity and the benefit of approximately billion of joint venture drilling carries in four of our big shale plays 
we expect exploration and development costs to generally increase in  partially offset by the use of a portion of our remaining billion of drilling carries associated with our joint ventures in the barnett and marcellus shales 
these drilling carries create a significant cost advantage for us that will allow us to continue to drive down finding costs 
the following table provides information about the joint ventures in millions shale play joint venture partner a joint venture date proceeds received at closing total drilling carries drilling carries remaining haynesville and bossier pxp july   b fayetteville bp september  marcellus sto november    c barnett tot january   d a joint venture partners include plains exploration production company pxp  bp america bp  statoil sto and total sa tot 
b in august  we amended our haynesville shale joint venture agreement with plains exploration production company pxp 
as part of the amendment  pxp accelerated the payment of its remaining joint venture drilling carries as of september  in exchange for an approximate reduction in the total amount of drilling carry obligations due to chesapeake 
as a result  on september   chesapeake received billion in cash from pxp and beginning in the fourth quarter chesapeake and pxp each began paying their proportionate working interest costs on drilling 
c as of december  d as of january  collectively  in these four joint ventures  we received upfront cash payments of billion and future drilling cost carries of up to billion for total consideration of up to billion against a cost basis of approximately billion in the property interests we sold 
moreover  chesapeake retained an interest in the haynesville and bossier shale properties  a interest in the fayetteville shale properties  a interest in the marcellus shale properties and a interest in the barnett shale properties 
the joint ventures in our big shale plays are a complementary part of our business strategy to maximize the value of our leasehold inventory and minimize our investment risk 
there are other new plays we are identifying and developing which may become additional joint venture opportunities 
our joint venture with global infrastructure partners in is another example of our joining with a strong partner to develop key assets  in this case  our midstream assets in the barnett shale and other midstream assets in the mid continent 
at the closing of this transaction  we received proceeds of million 
during  we sold non core natural gas and oil assets for proceeds of million 
over the next two years  we expect to be a net seller of leasehold and producing properties 

table of contents apart from asset monetizations  cash flow from operations is our primary source of liquidity used to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures 
our billion corporate revolving bank credit facility  our million midstream revolving bank credit facility and the company s million midstream joint venture revolving bank credit facility  discussed more fully in liquidity and capital resources  provide us with additional liquidity 
in february  we issued billion principal amount of our senior notes due net proceeds of billion were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving bank credit facility  which we reborrow from time to time to fund drilling and leasehold acquisition initiatives and for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had borrowings of billion and letters of credit of million outstanding under our credit facilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate asset monetization transactions in order to create additional value from our proved and unproved properties and to increase our financial flexibility 
management believes that our leasehold and development joint ventures and various asset monetization programs benefit the company by improving our asset base  reducing our financial risk  decreasing our dd a rate and increasing our profitability per unit of production  thereby increasing our returns on capital and advancing future value creation 
we may also consider alternative sources of public or private investment in the company or its subsidiaries 
while we believe that our anticipated internally generated cash flow  cash resources and other sources of liquidity will allow us to fully fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements  further deterioration of the economy and other factors could require us to fund these expenditures from monetization transactions or further curtail our spending 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds cash flow from operations is a significant source of liquidity used to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures 
cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion in and billion in the billion decrease from to was primarily due to lower natural gas and oil prices 
the million increase from to was primarily due to higher natural gas volumes and higher oil prices 
changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income  excluding non cash items such as depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives 
see the discussion below under results of operations 
changes in market prices for natural gas and oil directly impact the level of our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate the risk of declines in natural gas or oil prices and to provide more predictable future cash flow from operations  as of february   we have hedged through swaps and collars approximately of our expected natural gas and oil production in at average prices of per mcfe 
our natural gas and oil hedges as of december  are detailed in item a of this report 
depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and management s view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
our billion corporate revolving bank credit facility  our million midstream revolving bank credit facility  our million midstream joint venture revolving bank credit facility and cash and cash equivalents are other sources of liquidity 
following the january closing of our barnett shale joint venture with total for million in cash and the february closing of our sixth vpp transaction for million in cash  as of february   there was billion of borrowing capacity under the corporate credit facility  million of borrowing capacity under the midstream credit facility and million under the midstream joint venture credit facility 
we use the facilities and cash on hand to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed 
we borrowed billion and repaid 
table of contents billion in  we borrowed billion and repaid billion in and we borrowed billion and repaid billion in under our bank credit facilities 
a substantial portion of our natural gas and oil properties is currently unencumbered and therefore available to be pledged as additional collateral under our corporate revolving bank credit facility if needed based on our periodic borrowing base and collateral redeterminations 
accordingly  we believe our borrowing capacity under this facility will not be reduced as a result of any such future periodic redeterminations 
our two midstream facilities are secured by substantially all of our midstream assets and are not subject to periodic borrowing base redeterminations

in september  we formed a joint venture with global infrastructure partners gip  a new york based private equity fund  to own and operate natural gas midstream assets 
as part of the transaction  we contributed certain natural gas gathering and processing assets into a new entity  chesapeake midstream partners  llc cmp  and gip purchased a interest in cmp for million in cash 
in june  we received net proceeds of million from the mortgage financing of our regional barnett shale headquarters building in fort worth  texas 
the interest only loan has a five year term at a floating rate of prime plus basis points 
at our option  we may prepay the loan in full without penalty beginning in year four 
in april  we financed real estate surface assets in the barnett shale area in and around fort worth  texas for net proceeds of approximately million and entered into a master lease 
table of contents agreement under which we agreed to lease the assets for years for approximately million to million annually 
this lease transaction was recorded as a financing lease 
our primary use of funds is for capital expenditures related to exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties 
we refer you to the table under investing activities below  which sets forth the components of our natural gas and oil investing activities and other investing activities for  and we retain a significant degree of control over the timing of our capital expenditures which permits us to defer or accelerate certain capital expenditures if necessary to address any potential liquidity issues 
in addition  higher drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
we paid dividends on our common stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend of common stock from to per share beginning with the dividend paid in july dividends paid on our preferred stock decreased to million in from million in and million in as a result of conversions and exchanges of preferred stock into common stock during  and in  and  we received million  and paid million and million  respectively  to settle a portion of the derivative liabilities assumed in our acquisition of columbia natural resources  llc 
additionally in  we received million for settlements of derivatives which were classified as financing derivatives 
credit risk a significant portion of our liquidity is concentrated in derivative instruments that enable us to hedge a portion of our exposure to natural gas and oil prices and interest rate volatility 
these arrangements expose us to credit risk from our counterparties 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into derivative contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers  and we attempt to limit our exposure to non performance by any single counterparty 
during the more than years we have engaged in hedging activities  we have experienced a counterparty default only once lehman brothers in september  and the total loss recorded in that instance was immaterial 
on december   our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments were spread among counterparties 
additionally  our multi counterparty secured hedging facility requires our counterparties to secure their natural gas and oil hedging obligations in excess of defined thresholds 
our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of natural gas and oil million at december  and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate million at december  
this industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
during  we recognized million of bad debt expense related to potentially uncollectible receivables 

table of contents investing activities while we continue to maintain an active drilling program and acquire leasehold and unproved property needed for planned natural gas and oil development  cash used in investing activities declined significantly in cash used in investing activities decreased to billion in  compared to billion in and billion in our investing activities in and reflected our increasing focus on acquiring unproved leasehold  converting our resource inventory into production  redeploying our capital by selling natural gas and oil properties with lower rates of return and increasing our investment in properties with higher return potential 
we also invested in drilling rigs  gathering systems  compressors  and other property and equipment to support our natural gas and oil exploration  development and production activities 
these activities continued in  but at a reduced rate in response to a low natural gas price environment  lower demand and the benefit of our joint venture carries

hedging facilities we began with six secured hedging facilities  each of which permitted us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil commodity transactions  valued by the counterparty  for up to a stated maximum value 
outstanding transactions under each of the facilities were collateralized by certain of our natural gas and oil properties that did not secure any of our other obligations 
on june   we entered into a multi counterparty hedge facility with counterparties that have committed to provide approximately tcfe of trading capacity and an aggregate mark to market capacity of billion under the terms of the facility 
the new multi counterparty facility has consolidated and replaced the six secured hedge facilities 
all prior trades with these counterparties have been novated and pledged collateral transferred to the multi counterparty facility  which had a total of tcfe hedged and collateral value of approximately billion as of december  trades from the original six secured hedging facilities will continue to be subject to pre existing exposure fees  but we are not required to pay an exposure fee for any new trades in the multi counterparty facility 
the multi counterparty facility allows us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil price and basis hedges with the counterparties 
our obligations under the multi counterparty facility are secured by natural gas and oil proved reserves  the value of which must cover the fair value of the transactions outstanding under the facility by at least times  and guarantees by certain subsidiaries that also guarantee our corporate revolving bank credit facility and indentures 
the counterparties obligations under the facility must be secured by cash or short term us treasury instruments to the extent that any mark to market amounts they owe to chesapeake exceed defined thresholds 
the maximum volume based trading capacity under the facility is governed by the expected production of the pledged reserve collateral  and volume based trading limits are applied separately to price and basis hedges 
in addition  there are volume based sub limits for natural gas and oil hedges 
chesapeake has significant flexibility with regard to releases and or substitutions of pledged reserves  provided that certain collateral coverage and other requirements are met 
the facility does not have a maturity date 
counterparties to the agreement have the right to cease trading with the company on a prospective basis as long as obligations associated with any existing trades in the facility continue to be satisfied in accordance with the terms of the agreement

the notes are convertible  at the holder s option  prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process 
one such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter 
convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarter by quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and  as a result  the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the first quarter of under this provision 
the notes are also convertible  at the holder s option  during specified five day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock 
in general  upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note  the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
we will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years  under certain conditions

hedging activities natural gas and oil hedging activities our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company s hedging program at its quarterly board meetings 
we believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  collars  call options  put options  knockout swaps and basis protection swaps 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged natural gas and oil production 
we closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss 
commodity markets are volatile and chesapeake s hedging activities are dynamic 
mark to market positions under natural gas and oil hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices 
as described above under hedging facilities  our secured multi counterparty hedging facility allows us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations in the value of our natural gas and oil hedges by pledging natural gas and oil properties

a detailed explanation of accounting for foreign currency derivatives appears under application of critical accounting policies hedging elsewhere in this item results of operations general 
for the year ended december   chesapeake had a net loss of billion  or a loss of per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion during the year ended december   and net income of billion  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion during the year ended december  natural gas and oil sales 
during  natural gas and oil sales were billion compared to billion in and billion in in  chesapeake produced and sold bcfe of natural gas and oil at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to bcfe in at a weighted average price of per mcfe  and bcfe in at a weighted average price of per mcfe weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in prices in resulted in a decrease in revenue of billion and increased production resulted in a million increase  for a total decrease in revenues of billion excluding unrealized gains or losses on natural gas and oil derivatives 
the increase in production from period to period was primarily generated from the drillbit 
for  we realized an average price per mcf of natural gas of  compared to in and in weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives

realized gains or losses from our natural gas and oil derivatives resulted in a net increase in natural gas and oil revenues of billion or per mcfe in  a net decrease of million or per mcfe in and a net increase of billion or per mcfe in 
table of contents a change in natural gas and oil prices has a significant impact on our natural gas and oil revenues and cash flows 
assuming production levels  a change of per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately million and million  respectively  and a change of per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately million and million  without considering the effect of hedging activities

marketing  gathering and compression activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in chesapeake operated wells 
chesapeake realized billion in marketing  gathering and compression sales in  with corresponding marketing  gathering and compression expenses of billion  for a net margin before depreciation of million 
this compares to sales of billion and billion  expenses of billion and billion  and margins before depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
in and  chesapeake realized an increase in marketing  gathering and compression net margin primarily due to an increase in third party marketing volumes 
service operations revenue and operating expenses 
service operations consist of third party revenue and operating expenses related to our drilling and oilfield trucking operations 
chesapeake recognized million in service operations revenue in with corresponding service operations expenses of million  for a net margin before depreciation of million 
this compares to revenue of million and million  expenses of million and million and a net margin before depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
these operations have grown as a result of assets and businesses we acquired and leased as seen in the growth in revenues 
however  the net margins have decreased each of the previous three years 
this is the result of increased expenses associated with the leasing cost of the numerous rigs we have sold and leased back in the previous three years 

table of contents production expenses 
production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the expense decrease in was primarily due to lower service costs in the field as a result of the economic downturn 
our per unit decrease in was also affected by the increase in production 
we expect that production expenses per mcfe produced for will range from to

production taxes were million in compared to million in and million in on a unit of production basis  production taxes were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in and per mcfe in the million decrease in production taxes from to is due to a decrease in the realized average sales price of natural gas and oil of per mcfe excluding gains or losses on derivatives  which more than offset the production increase of bcfe 
in general  production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when natural gas and oil prices are higher 
we expect production taxes for to range from to per mcfe based on estimated nymex prices ranging from to per mcf of natural gas and an oil price of per barrel 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  including stock based compensation but excluding internal costs capitalized to our natural gas and oil properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were  and per mcfe for  and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily the result of decreased spending related to media relations 
included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of million in  million in and million in restricted stock grants are expensed at the price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the increase in was the result of a larger number of unvested shares being expensed during compared to we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for will be between and per mcfe produced  including stock based compensation ranging from to per mcfe produced 

table of contents our stock based compensation for employees and non employee directors is in the form of restricted stock 
employee restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of four or five years 
our non employee director awards vest over a period of three years 
the discussion of stock based compensation in note and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of our stock based compensation 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with natural gas and oil property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we capitalized million  million and million of internal costs in  and  respectively  directly related to our natural gas and oil property acquisition  exploration and development efforts 
natural gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of natural gas and oil properties was billion  billion and billion during  and  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the average rate from in to in is due primarily to reductions of our natural gas and oil full cost pool resulting from our divestitures in and and impairments of our full cost pool in and as well as the addition of reserves through our drilling activities 
we expect the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe produced 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the average dd a rate per mcfe was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase from to was mainly due to the significant increase in our investment in gathering systems  compressors  buildings and drilling rigs 
property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis 
buildings are depreciated over to years  gathering facilities are depreciated over years  drilling rigs are depreciated over years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from two to twenty years 
to the extent company owned drilling rigs are used to drill our wells  a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in natural gas and oil properties as exploration or development costs 
we expect depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between and per mcfe produced 
impairment of natural gas and oil properties and other assets 
due to lower commodity prices in the second half of and throughout  we reported a non cash impairment charge on our natural gas and oil properties of billion in and billion in we account for our natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting  which limits the amount of costs we can capitalize and requires us to write off these costs if the carrying value of natural gas and oil assets in the evaluated portion of our full cost pool exceeds the sum of the present value of expected future net cash flows of proved reserves using a pre tax discount rate based on pricing and cost assumptions and the present value of certain natural gas and oil hedges 
additionally  in  we recorded an impairment of million associated with certain of our midstream assets and million associated with certain of our service operations assets 
other income expense 
other income expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the loss consisted of million of interest income  a million loss related to our equity in the net losses of certain investments  a million gain on sale of assets and million of miscellaneous income 
the loss consisted of million of interest 
table of contents income  a million loss related to our equity in the net losses of certain investments  a million gain on sale of assets  million of expense related to consent solicitation fees and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million of interest income and million of miscellaneous income 
income related to equity investments was not significant in interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in and million in as follows years ended december  in millions interest expense on senior notes interest expense on credit facilities capitalized interest realized gain loss on interest rate derivatives unrealized gain loss on interest rate derivatives amortization of loan discount and other total interest expense average long term borrowings interest expense  excluding unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivatives was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in and per mcfe in the decrease in interest expense per mcfe for and is due to increased production volumes and an increase in capitalized interest 
capitalized interest increased in and as a result of a significant increase in unevaluated properties  the base on which interest is capitalized 
we expect interest expense for to be between and per mcfe produced before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives 
impairment of investments 
we recorded a million and million impairment of certain investments in and  respectively 
each of our investees has been impacted by the dramatic slowing of the worldwide economy and the freezing of the credit markets in the fourth quarter of and into the economic weakness has resulted in significantly reduced natural gas and oil prices leading to a meaningful decline in the overall level of activity in the markets served by our investees 
associated with the weakness in performance of certain of the investees  as well as an evaluation of their financial condition and near term prospects  we recognized that an other than temporary impairment had occurred on the following investments in gastar exploration  ltd  million  chaparral energy  inc  million  dhs drilling company  million  ventura refining  transmission llc  inc  million  and mountain drilling company  million 
we recognized that an other than temporary impairment had occurred on the following investments in chaparral energy  inc  million  dhs drilling company  million  mountain drilling company  million  and ventura refining and transmission llc  inc  million 
loss on exchanges or repurchases of chesapeake debt 
during  we privately exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
through these transactions  we were able to redeem this debt for common stock valued at less than of the face value of the notes 
associated with these exchanges  we recorded a loss of million 
in connection with accounting guidance for debt with conversion and other options  we are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately 
of the million principal amount of convertible notes exchanged in  million was allocated to the debt component and the remaining million was allocated to the equity 
table of contents conversion feature and was recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital 
the difference between the debt component and the value of the common stock exchanged in these transactions resulted in a million loss 
in addition  we expensed million in deferred charges associated with these exchanges 
during  we exchanged approximately million  million and million in aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due  contingent convertible senior notes due  and contingent convertible senior notes due  respectively  for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
through these transactions  we were able to redeem this debt for common stock valued at less than of the face value of the notes 
associated with these exchanges  we recorded a gain of million 
of the combined million principal amount of convertible notes exchanged in  million was allocated to the debt component and the remaining million was allocated to the equity conversion feature and was recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital 
the difference between the debt component and the value of the common stock exchanged in these transactions resulted in a million gain 
this gain was partially offset by the write off of million in deferred charges associated with these exchanges 
also during  we repurchased million of our senior notes due in order to re finance a portion of our long term debt at a lower rate of interest 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a million loss  which consisted of a million premium and million of discounts  interest rate derivatives and deferred charges associated with the notes 
gain on sale of investments 
in  we sold our limited partnership interest in eagle energy partners i  lp  which we first acquired in  for proceeds of million and a gain of million 
income tax expense benefit 
chesapeake recorded an income tax benefit of billion in compared to income tax expense of million in and million in of the income tax benefit recorded in  million is reflected as current income tax expense and billion is reflected as a deferred income tax benefit 
of the billion decrease in  billion was the result of the decrease in net income before taxes which was offset by million as the result of a decrease in the effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences 
we expect our effective income tax rate to be in loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock 
loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock was  million and million in  and  respectively 
the loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for further detail regarding these transactions 
application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the three policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies are an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 

table of contents hedging 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in natural gas and oil  changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of natural gas and oil derivative transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales  and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within natural gas and oil sales or interest expense 
cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged  or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments 
accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in natural gas and oil sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   
table of contents and  the fair value of our derivatives was a liability of million  an asset of billion and a liability of million  respectively 
the derivatives that we acquired in our cnr acquisition represented million and million of liability at december  and natural gas and oil properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for natural gas and oil business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of natural gas and oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher natural gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
under the full cost method  capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved natural gas and oil reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves or future development costs changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
for  capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceeded the estimated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves  net of related income tax considerations  resulting in a write down in the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties of billion  net of tax 
in calculating future net revenues  effective december   current prices are calculated as the average natural gas and oil prices during the preceding month period prior to the end of the current reporting period  determined as the unweighted arithmetical average of prices on the first day of each month within the month period and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts  including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges 
based on the average prices for natural gas and oil during the months of  these cash flow hedges increased the full cost ceiling by billion  thereby reducing the ceiling test write down by the same amount 

table of contents two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and natural gas and oil prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
any excess of the net book value  less deferred income taxes  is generally written off as an expense 
in december  the sec issued its final rule for modernization of oil and gas reporting 
pursuant to this rule the sec adopted revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosures effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves  which should help investors evaluate the relative value of oil and gas companies 
in the three decades that have passed since the original adoption of oil and gas disclosure items  there have been significant changes in the oil and gas industry 
these revisions are designed to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
the new rules include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves 
the requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of the technical person s primarily responsible for the preparation or audit of reserve estimations and to file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare or audit reserve estimates 
in addition  the new rules require that oil and gas reserves be reported and the full cost ceiling value calculated using average first of the month natural gas and oil prices during the month period ending in the reporting period  compared to prices at period end under prior sec rules 
it is not practicable for chesapeake to estimate the effect of adopting the new reserve rules  however  these revisions and requirements affect the comparability between reporting periods for reserve volume and value estimates  full cost pool write down calculations and the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas assets 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
as of december   chesapeake had proved reserves of tcfe at nymex spot prices of per mcf and per barrel before price differential adjustments 
as of december   we had proved reserves of tcfe at month average prices of per mcf and per barrel before price differential adjustments 
the increase in proved reserves is  in part  due to the new reserve rules in effect for this filing 
our december  proved undeveloped pud reserve volume was tcfe and our december  pud reserve volume was tcfe 
this increase is partially attributable to the modernized rules  which allow for the reporting of pud reserves more than one direct spacing area offsetting producing wells if reasonable certainty can be shown using reliable technology 
chesapeake has utilized and developed reliable geologic and engineering technology to book pud reserves more than one location offsetting production in the barnett shale and fayetteville shale 
within the barnett and fayetteville shale plays  we used both public and proprietary geologic data to establish continuity of the formation and its producing properties 
this included seismic data and interpretations d  d and micro seismic  open hole log information both vertical and horizontally collected and petrophysical analysis of the log data  mud logs  gas sample analysis  drill cutting samples  measurements of total organic content  thermal maturity  sidewall cores  whole cores and 
table of contents data measured from internal core analysis facility 
once the continuous geologic area was established  statistical analysis of established producing wells was used to generate reasonable certainty defined as probability aggregated to the field level 
the analysis required a statistically significant number of producing wells within the defined geologic area and then tested for confidence by insuring the variance in results over time  area and distance was evaluated 
proper development spacing was also statistically analyzed 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
under accounting guidance for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefit  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if i natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  ii exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or iii we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
guidance is also provided regarding de recognition  classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions 
based on this guidance  we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed 
tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions 
we accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense 
penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses 
additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties since chesapeake was founded in  our ceo  aubrey k 
mcclendon  has acquired working interests in virtually all of our natural gas and oil properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of the founder well participation program fwpp and predecessor participation arrangements provided for in mr 
mcclendon s employment agreements 
under the fwpp  approved by our shareholders in june  mr 
mcclendon may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of chesapeake during a calendar year  but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake s board of directors not less than days prior to the start of each calendar year 
his participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the fwpp  which  among other things  limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake s working interest would be reduced below as a result of his participation 
in addition  the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by mr 
mcclendon as a result of his well participation 
on december   we entered into a new five year employment agreement with mr 
mcclendon that contained a one time well cost incentive award to him 
the total cost of the award to chesapeake was million plus employment taxes in the amount of approximately million 
we will recognize the incentive award as general and administrative expense over the five year vesting period for the clawback described below  resulting in an expense of approximately million per year that began in in addition to state and federal income tax withholding  similar employment taxes were imposed on mr 
mcclendon and withheld from the award 
the net incentive award of approximately million was fully applied against costs attributable to interests in company wells acquired by mr 
mcclendon or his affiliates under the fwpp in the incentive award is subject to a clawback if during the initial five year term of the employment agreement  mr 
mcclendon resigns from the company or is terminated for cause by the company 
as disclosed in note  in  chesapeake had revenues of billion from natural gas and oil sales to eagle energy partners i  lp  a former affiliated entity 
we sold our limited partnership interest in eagle energy in june recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued amendments to the consolidation standard applicable to variable interest entities in response to concerns about the transparency of involvement with variable interest entities 
the amended standard is effective for calendar year companies beginning on january  beginning january   we will deconsolidate our joint venture with gip and account for the investment in the joint venture under the equity method going forward 
adoption of this guidance will result in a cumulative effect adjustment for the difference in our equity in the joint venture at january   which was originally recorded at carryover basis  and the fair value of our equity at the formation of the joint venture based on the then fair value 
this cumulative effect adjustment will create a basis difference between our equity investment balance and the underlying equity in the net assets of the joint venture 
this difference will be accreted through earnings over the expected useful life of the underlying assets held by the joint venture 
in january  the fasb updated its oil and gas estimation and disclosure requirements to align its requirements with the sec s modernized oil and gas reporting rules  which are described above under application of critical accounting policies 
the update amends the definition of proved reserves to use the average of first day of the month prices during the months preceding the end of the reporting period  adds definitions used in estimating and disclosing proved oil and natural gas quantities and expands the disclosures required for equity method investments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk natural gas and oil hedging activities our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas and oil prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives 
our general strategy for attempting to mitigate exposure to adverse natural gas and oil price changes is to hedge into strengthening natural gas and oil futures markets when prices allow us to generate high cash margins and when we view prices to be in the upper range of our predicted most likely future price range 
information we consider in forming an opinion about future prices includes general economic conditions  industrial output levels and expectations  producer breakeven cost structures  liquefied natural gas import trends  natural gas and oil storage inventory levels  industry decline rates for base production and weather trends 
throughout and  we restructured many of our trades that included knockout features as commodity prices decreased 
the knockouts were typically restructured into straight swaps or collars based on strip prices at the time of the restructure 
additionally  in the latter half of we took advantage of attractive strip prices in through and sold natural gas and oil call options to our counterparties in exchange for and natural gas swaps with strike prices above the then current market price 
this effectively allowed us to sell out year volatility through call options at terms acceptable to us in exchange for straight natural gas swaps with strike prices well in excess of the then current market price for natural gas 
we use a wide range of derivative instruments to achieve our risk management objectives  including swaps  various collar arrangements and options puts or calls 
all of these are described in more detail below 
we typically use swaps or collars for a large portion of the natural gas and oil volume we hedge 
swaps are used when the price level is acceptable and collars are used when the downside protection from the bought put is meaningful and the cap on upside from the sold call is at a satisfactory level 
we also sell calls  taking advantage of market volatility for a portion of our projected production volumes when the strike price levels and the premiums are attractive to us 
typically  we sell call options when we would be satisfied to sell our production at the price being capped by the call strike or believe it to be more likely than not that the future natural gas or oil price will stay below the call strike price plus the premium we will receive 
we determine the volume we may potentially hedge by reviewing the company s estimated future production levels  which are derived from extensive examination of existing producing reserve estimates and estimates of likely production risked from new drilling 
production forecasts are updated at least monthly and adjusted if necessary to actual results and activity levels 
we do not hedge more volumes than we expect to produce  and if production estimates are lowered for future periods and hedges are already executed for some volume above the new production forecasts  the hedges are reversed 
the actual fixed hedge price on our derivative instruments is derived from bidding and the reference nymex price  as reflected in current nymex trading 
the pricing dates of 
table of contents our derivative contracts follow nymex futures 
all of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed price payment and the floating price payment  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
hedging positions  including swaps and collars  are adjusted in response to changes in prices and market conditions as part of an ongoing dynamic process 
we review our hedging positions continuously and if future market conditions change and prices have fallen to levels we believe could jeopardize the effectiveness of a position  we will mitigate such risk by either doing a cash settlement with our counterparty  restructuring the position  or by entering into a new swap that effectively reverses the current position a counter swap 
the factors we consider in closing or restructuring a position before the settlement date are identical to those we reviewed when deciding to enter into the original hedge position 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of the following swaps chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty for the hedged commodity 
collars these instruments contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price 
if the market price is between the put and the call strike price  no payments are due from either party 
three way collars include an additional put option in exchange for a more favorable strike price on the collar 
this eliminates the counterparty s downside exposure below the second put option 
call options chesapeake sells call options in exchange for a premium from the counterparty 
at the time of settlement  if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess and if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option  no payment is due from either party 
put options chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a put option 
if the market price falls below the fixed price of the put option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such shortfall 
if the market price settles above the fixed price of the put option  no payment is due from either party 
knockout swaps chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for the possibility to reduce the counterparty s exposure to zero  in any given month  if the floating market price is lower than certain pre determined knockout prices 
basis protection swaps these instruments are arrangements that guarantee a price differential to nymex for natural gas from a specified delivery point 
for non appalachian basin basis protection swaps  which typically have negative differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
for appalachian basin basis protection swaps  which typically have positive differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract 
in accordance with accounting guidance for hedging and derivatives  to the extent that a legal right of set off exists  chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
cash settlements of our derivative arrangements are generally classified as operating cash flows unless the derivative contains a significant financing element at contract inception  in which case  all cash settlements are classified as financing cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows

we have determined the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been mitigated under our new secured hedging facility which requires counterparties to post collateral if their obligations to chesapeake are in excess of defined thresholds 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 

table of contents the table below reconciles the years ended december   and changes in fair value of our natural gas and oil derivatives 
of the million fair value asset as of december   million relates to contracts maturing in the next months  of which we expect to transfer approximately million net of income taxes from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income loss  and million relates to contracts maturing after months 
all transactions hedged as of december  are expected to mature by december  in millions fair value of contracts outstanding  as of january change in fair value of contracts fair value of contracts when entered into contracts realized or otherwise settled fair value of contracts when closed fair value of contracts outstanding  as of december the change in natural gas and oil prices during the year ended december  increased the value of our derivative assets by billion 
this gain is recorded in natural gas and oil sales or in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we entered into new contracts which had premiums of million  and a liability was recorded 
we settled and closed out contracts  reducing our assets by billion and million  respectively  and the realized gain is recorded in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production 
pursuant to accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging  certain derivatives qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
following these provisions  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as the physical transactions being hedged occur 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is currently recognized in natural gas and oil sales as unrealized gains losses 
changes in the fair value of non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity ie  temporary fluctuations in value are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses within natural gas and oil sales 
realized gains losses are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production 
chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap 
under the counter swap  chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty 
the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap 
generally  at the time chesapeake enters into a counter swap  chesapeake removes the original swap s designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge 
the reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
instead  the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain or loss that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in natural gas and oil prices 
any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production 

table of contents the components of natural gas and oil sales for the years ended december   and are presented below

chesapeake pays the fixed price and receives the floating price 
the fair value of these swaps as of december  was an asset of million

years of maturity thereafter total in millions liabilities long term debt fixed rate a average interest rate long term debt variable rate average interest rate a this amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of million and interest rate derivatives of million 
changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facilities 
all of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of fluctuations in earnings or cash flow due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to volatility in interest rates related to our senior notes and credit facilities  we enter into interest rate derivatives 
as of december   our interest rate derivative instruments were comprised of the following types of instruments swaps chesapeake enters into fixed to floating interest rate swaps we receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating market rate to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of our senior notes 
we enter into floating to fixed interest rate swaps we receive a floating market rate and a pay fixed interest rate to manage our interest rate exposure related to our bank credit facility borrowings 

table of contents collars these instruments contain a fixed floor rate floor and a ceiling rate cap 
if the floating rate is above the cap  we have a net receivable from the counterparty and if the floating rate is below the floor  we have a net payable to the counterparty 
if the floating rate is between the floor and the cap  there is no payment due from either party 
collars are used to manage our interest rate exposure related to our bank credit facilities borrowings 
call options occasionally we sell call options for a premium when we think it is more likely that the option will expire unexercised 
the option allows the counterparty to terminate an open swap at a specific date 
swaptions occasionally we sell an option to a counterparty for a premium which allows the counterparty to enter into a swap with us on a specific date

in  we closed interest rate derivatives for gains totaling million of which million was recognized in interest expense 
the remaining million was from interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges which are accounted for as a reduction to our senior notes 
the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to realized interest expense over the remaining term of the related senior notes ranging from four to eleven years 
for interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets liabilities  and the debt s carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative 
changes in the fair value of non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity ie  temporary fluctuations in value are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses within interest expense 

table of contents gains or losses from interest rate derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
the components of interest expense for the years ended december   and are presented below 
years ended december  in millions interest expense on senior notes interest expense on credit facilities capitalized interest realized gains losses on interest rate derivatives unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivatives amortization of loan discount and other total interest expense foreign currency derivatives on december   we issued million of euro denominated senior notes due concurrent with the issuance of the euro denominated senior notes  we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes 
under the terms of the cross currency swap  on each semi annual interest payment date  the counterparties pay chesapeake million and chesapeake pays the counterparties million  which yields an annual dollar equivalent interest rate of 
upon maturity of the notes  the counterparties will pay chesapeake million and chesapeake will pay the counterparties million 
the terms of the cross currency swap were based on the dollar euro exchange rate on the issuance date of to 
through the cross currency swap  we have eliminated any potential variability in chesapeake s expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
the fair value of the cross currency swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset of million at december  the euro denominated debt in notes payable has been adjusted to million at december  using an exchange rate of to
