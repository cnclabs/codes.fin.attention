overview we are a leading provider of payroll  human resource  and benefits outsourcing solutions for small to medium sized businesses 
our payroll and human resource services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs 
our payroll services are the foundation of our service portfolio 
they are provided through either our core payroll or major market services mms  which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs  and include payroll processing  payroll tax administration services  employee payment services  and regulatory compliance services new hire reporting and garnishment processing 

table of contents in addition to the above  our software as a service option through our mms platform provides human resource management  employee benefits management  time and attendance systems  online expense reporting  and applicant tracking 
our human resource services primarily include paychex hr solutions  under which we offer our administrative services organization aso and our professional employer organization peo  retirement services administration  insurance services  eservices  and other human resource services and products 
we mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed 
service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients  checks or transactions per client per pay period  and utilization of ancillary services 
we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
our business strategy is focused on achieving strong long term financial performance by providing high quality  timely  accurate  and affordable services  growing our client base  increasing utilization of our ancillary services  leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure  and expanding our service offerings 
our financial results for fiscal were impacted by the cumulative adverse effects of the economic recession in the united states us and global financial crisis that began in unemployment rates in the us reached a high in october  and have remained high 
the equity markets hit a low in march  with interest rates available on high quality instruments remaining low since then 
the federal funds rate has been at a range of zero to since december our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of for fiscal  compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the weak economy affects our ability to acquire and retain clients  reduces our transaction volumes related to fewer employees in our client base  and results in lower average invested balances in our funds held for clients portfolio 
our results  while reflecting a decline compared to fiscal  were in line with our expectations 
although the economy has remained weak throughout fiscal  our key indicators have reflected modest improvement as the fiscal year progressed 
highlights of our financial results for fiscal compared to fiscal are as follows payroll service revenue decreased to billion 
human resource services revenue increased to million 
interest on funds held for clients decreased to million 
total revenue decreased to billion 
operating income decreased to million  and operating income  net of certain items  decreased to million 
refer to the non gaap financial measure discussion on page for further information on operating income  net of certain items 
operating income reflected an expense charge of million to increase the litigation reserve for the rapid payroll court decision during the third quarter of fiscal  which reduced diluted earnings per share by per share 
net income and diluted earnings per share decreased to million and per share  respectively 

table of contents cash flow from operations decreased to million  primarily related to the decline in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities 
dividends of million were paid to stockholders  representing of net income 
non gaap financial measure in addition to reporting operating income  a us generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure  we present operating income  net of certain items  which is a non gaap measure 
we believe operating income  net of certain items  is an appropriate additional measure  as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period 
it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year s targets and measuring management s performance in connection with certain performance based compensation payments and awards 
operating income  net of certain items  excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal to increase the litigation reserve 
interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates  which are not within the control of management 
the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature 
it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period 
operating income  net of certain items  is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission sec 
as such  it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and  therefore  should not be used in isolation  but in conjunction with the gaap measure 
the use of any non gaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non gaap measure used by other companies 
operating income  net of certain items  decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal business outlook our client base was approximately  clients as of may   compared to approximately  clients as of may   and approximately  clients as of may  our client base declined for fiscal  compared to a decline of for fiscal and growth of for fiscal the reduction in our client base for fiscal reflects the impact of weaker economic conditions on our ability to acquire and retain clients 
the environment for new sales remained difficult and new sales units decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of low levels of new business formation and fewer companies moving to outsourcing 
for fiscal  client retention was approximately of our beginning of the fiscal year client base 
while this was relatively consistent with the prior year  we have begun to see some signs of improvement  as clients lost in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees decreased for fiscal  compared to an increase of for fiscal we focus on satisfying customers to maximize client retention  and for fiscal we again received high client satisfaction results 
ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and  therefore  are beneficial to our operating margin 
although the growth rates for our ancillary services for fiscal were slower than we have seen 
table of contents historically due to the impacts of the weak economy  we continue to see opportunities within these services 
the following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings as of may  payroll tax administration services penetration employee payment services penetration paychex hr solutions client employees served paychex hr solutions clients insurance services clients retirement services clients includes workers compensation insurance clients and health and benefits services clients 
continued investment in our business is critical to our success 
in fiscal  we made investments in our sales force and in our technological infrastructure 
our sales force increased to  sales representatives for fiscal  and is expected to grow to  sales representatives for the fiscal year ending may  fiscal 
this growth is driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other human resource services offerings 
we have invested over million in an enhanced platform for our core payroll processing capability  which was fully implemented in fiscal this new platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients 
over the next few years  we expect to expand our enhanced platform to additional service offerings 
we continued expansion of our insurance services nationwide  simplifying the process for our clients to obtain coverage through our network of national and regional insurers 
we see our insurance services as an area that continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth 
we also strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and other interested parties 
the new paychex insurance agency website  www 
paychexinsurance 
com  helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage 
in addition  we provide information for existing and prospective clients on the impacts of regulatory changes  such as the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act and the recently passed federal health care reform bill 
our aso and peo are now being offered under paychex hr solutions 
we integrated the sales and service model to support and expand our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services nationwide 
this allowed us to eliminate redundancies  and create more flexible options for potential clients 
peo services will continue to be sold by the registered and licensed paychex business solutions  inc and its affiliates 
looking to the future  we continue to focus on investing in our products  people  and service capabilities 
this will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long term growth 
financial position and liquidity the current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented volatility in the global financial markets  which has curtailed available liquidity and limited investment choices 
despite this macroeconomic environment  as of may   our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of million and no debt 
we continue to follow our conservative investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal 
in the past twenty months  this has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments  negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments 
since september  our primary short term investment vehicle has been us agency discount notes 
since then  we have seen gradual improvement in liquidity in certain money market sectors  and starting in november we began to invest in select a p rated variable rate demand notes vrdns 
during fiscal  we earned an after tax rate of approximately for vrdns compared to approximately for us agency discount notes 
we invest primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings 

table of contents we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer 
as of may   we had no exposure to british petroleum bp or any of its subsidiaries 
we believe that our investments as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired  nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other than temporary impairment 
all investments held as of may  are traded in active markets 
our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations 
cash flow from operations was million for fiscal historically  we have funded our operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments from our operating activities 
our positive cash flows in fiscal allowed us to support our business and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders 
during fiscal  dividends paid to stockholders were of net income 
it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may   along with projected operating cash flows  will support our normal business operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years   and  and our financial position as of may   refer to the tables and analysis in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this item and the discussion in the critical accounting policies section of this item outlook our outlook for fiscal is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes 
consistent with our policy regarding guidance  our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates 
we project that payroll service revenue for fiscal will be flat compared to fiscal human resource services revenue is anticipated to increase in the range of to 
interest on funds held for clients is expected to decrease in the range of to  while investment income  net is expected to increase in the range of to 
operating income  net of certain items  as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from to for fiscal the effective income tax rate is expected to approximate for fiscal net income is expected to improve slightly over fiscal however  when the impact of the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is excluded from fiscal  net income growth for fiscal is expected to be flat 
interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment 
the average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to be for fiscal as of may   the long term investment portfolio had an average yield to maturity of and an average duration of years 
in the next twelve months  slightly over of this portfolio will mature  and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 
investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations 
under normal financial market conditions  the impact to our earnings from a basis point increase or decrease in short term interest rates would be approximately million  after taxes  for a twelve month period 
such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 
purchases of property and equipment for fiscal are expected to be in the range of million to million  as we continue to invest in our technological infrastructure 
fiscal depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of million to million  and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal to be approximately million

our client base decreased during fiscal and checks per client decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal checks per client has shown modest improvement in each sequential quarter of fiscal  reflecting year over year declines of   and for the first through third fiscal quarters  and an increase of for the three months ended may  the fourth quarter 
at the end of fiscal  checks per client were slightly higher than at the end of fiscal payroll service revenue increased to billion for fiscal due to our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services  offset by impacts of weak economic conditions 
during fiscal  our client base declined  affected by a decline in new client sales from new business starts and clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees 
checks per client declined for fiscal our payroll tax administration services were utilized by of all our clients as of may   compared with as of may  and may  our employee payment services were utilized by of our clients as of may   compared with as of may  and as of may  nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than of new clients select a form of our employee payment services 
human resource services revenue human resource services revenue increased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
the following factors contributed to human resource services revenue growth for fiscal and fiscal in billions as of may  change change paychex hr solutions client employees served paychex hr solutions clients insurance services clients retirement services clients asset value of retirement services client employees funds includes workers compensation insurance clients and health and benefits services clients 
in addition  growth in products that are primarily beneficial to our mms clients contributed positively to human resource services revenue growth for fiscal health and benefits service revenue increased to million for fiscal and increased to million for fiscal 
table of contents while the above factors contributed to the revenue growth in both fiscal and fiscal as compared to the respective prior year periods  the rates of growth have been adversely affected by the cumulative impact of weak economic conditions on our client base growth 
this particularly affected retirement services  although we have seen client growth for retirement services rebound somewhat late in fiscal as client losses have improved compared to the prior year 
retirement services revenue growth was impacted in both fiscal and fiscal by billings in fiscal related to restatements of clients retirement plans required by statute  which are not expected to recur for approximately six years 
this favorably impacted retirement services revenue growth for fiscal by million and did not recur in fiscal in fiscal  human resource services revenue was also impacted by the sale of stromberg time and attendance stromberg  an immaterial component of paychex 
our human resource services revenue growth  excluding stromberg revenue and the retirement plan restatement billings  would have been as follows change human resource services revenue  as reported human resource services revenue excluding stromberg revenue and retirement plan restatement billings in fiscal  the increase in the asset value of retirement services client employees funds was driven by recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to paychex 
for fiscal  the volatility in the financial markets caused the asset value of retirement services client employees funds to decline 
the s p declined during the same period 
for both fiscal and fiscal  retirement services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the retirement services client employees funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers 
for fiscal  the decline in asset value and the shift in client employees retirement portfolios to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers reduced retirement services revenue growth by million 
also for fiscal  paychex hr solutions revenue growth was adversely impacted by fewer employees per client  decreasing revenue by million 
total service revenue total service revenue declined for fiscal and increased for fiscal the cumulative effect of the weak economy had a negative impact on service revenue growth as previously described 
interest on funds held for clients the decrease of in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances  offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities 
the decrease of in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of lower average interest rates earned  lower average investment balances  and lower net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities 
average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased for fiscal and for fiscal these declines were the result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the american recovery and reinvestment act of the economic stimulus package 
in the second half of fiscal  the impact of these factors was partially offset by increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the calendar year 
the economic stimulus package went into effect in april  and its impact on year over year comparisons of average invested balances has abated in the fourth quarter of fiscal this factor  along with the increases in state unemployment insurance rates  resulted in average invested balances for funds held for clients growing for the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal refer to the market risk factors section  contained in item a of this form k  for more information on changing interest rates 

table of contents combined operating and sg a expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal years in millions change change compensation related expenses stock based compensation costs facilities expenses depreciation of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets other expenses expense charge to increase the litigation reserve total operating and sg a expenses during fiscal  we recorded an expense charge of million to increase our litigation reserve 
refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional information on legal matters 
excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve  combined operating and sg a expenses decreased for fiscal and increased for fiscal the decline for fiscal was generated from cost control measures and lower headcount  offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force  customer service  and technological infrastructure 
in fiscal  we had a freeze on salary increases and made no matching contributions to our k plan 
we reinstituted salary increases beginning march   but the freeze saved us approximately million for fiscal as of may   no decision had been made on the reinstatement of the k match  although we saved approximately million for fiscal from its suspension 
the increase for fiscal was primarily due to increases in personnel  though at a slower pace than prior years  and other costs related to selling and retaining clients and promoting new services 
as of may   we had approximately  employees compared with approximately  employees as of may  and  employees as of may  depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings  furniture and fixtures  data processing equipment  and software 
increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business 
amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions  which are amortized using either straight line or accelerated methods 
the increase in amortization in fiscal was a result of intangibles from acquisitions and client list acquisitions 
other expenses include items such as delivery  forms and supplies  communications  travel and entertainment  professional services  and other costs incurred to support our business 
operating income operating income declined and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 
operating income  net of certain items  is as follows for fiscal years in millions change change operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients expense charge to increase the litigation reserve operating income  net of certain items 
table of contents refer to the previous discussion of operating income  net of certain items  in the non gaap financial measure section on page investment income  net investment income  net  primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities 
investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients  which is included in total revenue 
the decrease of in investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations 
the decrease of in investment income for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances attributed to funding the stock repurchase program  which was completed in december income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal  compared with for fiscal  and for fiscal the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal was primarily the result of higher state income tax rates from state legislative changes 
the increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal was primarily the result of lower levels of tax exempt income derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios 
refer to note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional disclosures on income taxes 
net income and earnings per share net income decreased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
diluted earnings per share decreased for fiscal and for fiscal to per share and per share  respectively 
these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed 
in particular  the million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve reduced diluted earnings per share by per share for fiscal combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income for fiscal decreased or million  reducing diluted earnings per share by per share 
for fiscal  combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income decreased or million  reducing diluted earnings per share by per share 
for fiscal  diluted earnings per share decreased at a lower rate than net income due to a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program completed in december liquidity and capital resources the volatility in the global financial markets that began in september curtailed available liquidity and limited investment choices 
despite this macroeconomic environment  our financial position as of may  remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of million and no debt 
we also believe that our investments as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired  nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other than temporary impairment 
it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may   along with projected operating cash flows  are expected to support our normal business operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
commitments and contractual obligations lines of credit as of may   we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted  secured  short term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows financial institution amount available expiration date jp morgan chase bank  na million february bank of america  na million february pnc bank  national association million february wells fargo bank  national association million february our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex  inc and each of the financial institutions the lenders  pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts 
the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders 
under certain circumstances  individual lenders may require that 
table of contents collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 
the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business  if necessary 
no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal or as of may  jp morgan chase bank  na and bank of america  na are also parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit  which arrangements are discussed below 
letters of credit as of may   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling million  required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies 
the letters of credit expire at various dates between july and may  and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios 
no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal or as of may  subsequent to may   the letter of credit expiring in july was renewed and will expire in july other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that  under gaap  are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may  the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may  payments due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment used in our branch operations 
purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations 
included in the total purchase obligations is million of commitments to purchase capital assets 
amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately million as of may  refer to note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for more information on income taxes 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 
we are currently under a state income tax audit for the years ended may  through the examination phase of the audit is ongoing and we have received a summary of proposed audit adjustments 
it is not possible for us to reasonably estimate the impact  if any  if resolution of these proposed adjustments is ultimately unfavorable to us 
certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities amounting to million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 
advantage payroll services inc advantage has license agreements with independently owned associate offices associates  which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions  while paychex and advantage provide all centralized back office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services 
under these arrangements  advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients 
when we acquired advantage  there were fifteen associates 
over the past few years  some arrangements with various associates have been discontinued  and there are currently fewer than ten associates 
since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain  obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above 
commission expense for the associates for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents we guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party 
in the normal course of business  we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients 
historically  there have been no material losses related to such guarantees 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  which require us to defend and  if necessary  indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 
we currently self insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans 
our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
historically  the amounts accrued have not been material 
we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability  errors and omissions  warranty liability  and acts of terrorism  and capacity for deductibles and self insured retentions through our captive insurance company 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
we do maintain investments as a limited partner in low income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations 
these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than of our total assets as of may  operating cash flow activities year ended may  in millions net income non cash adjustments to net income cash used in provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal related primarily to lower net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in non cash adjustments to net income in fiscal is primarily due to the million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve  partially offset by the related increase in deferred tax benefit 
the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal was attributable to lower net income 
the increase in non cash adjustments to net income in fiscal is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and intangible assets 
the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal and fiscal were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation  peo payroll  income tax  and other liabilities

the fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of investments 
as a result of volatility in the financial markets  in september we divested of any vrdn securities held and began to utilize us agency discount notes as our primary short term investment vehicle 
us agency discount notes are cash equivalents 
vrdns  although priced and traded as short term securities  are classified as available for sale securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these securities are included in investing activities 
as a result of the divestiture  the proceeds from sales of available for sale securities exceeded the purchases of available for sale securities in fiscal much of these proceeds were held as cash equivalents in the funds held for clients portfolio 
in november  we began to again invest in select a p rated vrdns  although at considerably lower levels than in the prior year 
we utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these vrdns  and in fiscal these purchases of available for sale securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of available for sale securities 
also in fiscal  more corporate funds have been invested in longer term municipal bonds 
there is a significant decline in net cash received from changes in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities in fiscal compared to fiscal related to proceeds from sales of available for sale securities in fiscal that were not reinvested as part of the funding of the billion stock repurchase program completed in december in general  fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases  sales  or maturities of investments 
the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds  and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services

table of contents result of may  being a federal holiday  client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on friday  may  that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until june also  in fiscal we have seen an increase in client fund obligations as a result of higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for the calendar year

actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period 
our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed 
the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue  and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred  which include wages  taxes  benefit premiums  and claims of peo worksite employees 
direct costs billed and incurred were billion for fiscal  and billion for both fiscal and fiscal revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized when all of the following are present persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  typically a non cancelable sales order  delivery is complete for the 
table of contents software and hardware  the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions 
revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
in certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund 
we maintain an allowance for returns  which is based on historical data 
the allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services  and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to days after receipt  with some items extending to days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting  holding  and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities 
peo workers compensation insurance workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us 
these reserves include estimates for reported losses  plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 
in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves  we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections  and is subject to change due to multiple factors  including economic trends  changes in legal liability law  and damage awards  all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves 
adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
such adjustments could possibly be significant  reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 
our maximum individual claims liability was million under both the fiscal and fiscal policies 
as of may  and may   we had recorded current liabilities of million and million  respectively  and long term liabilities of million and million  respectively  for workers compensation claims 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have million and million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of may  and may   respectively  resulting from acquisitions of businesses 
the decrease in goodwill was due to the divestiture in fiscal of stromberg  an immaterial component of the company 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our business is largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter 
based on the results of our reviews  no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal or fiscal subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation costs all stock based awards to employees  including grants of stock options  are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured 
table of contents as of the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life 
we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility 
expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior 
we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest 
our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience 
forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change  and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 
the assumptions of volatility  expected option life  and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior  stock price trends  and changes to type or provisions of stock based awards 
any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 
we have determined that the black scholes option pricing model  as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application  is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants 
we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model  and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value  or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock based compensation costs recognized for certain stock based awards 
at the time of exercise of non qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards  we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid in capital 
we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock based awards 
we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements 
prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements  we must conclude that tax positions must be more likely than not to be sustained  assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities 
if a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard  the benefit can no longer be recognized 
assumptions  judgment  and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit 
a change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions was million as of may  and million as of may  refer to note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities 
corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
as a result of our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
changes in interest rates will impact the 
table of contents earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer term available for sale securities 
we follow a conservative investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal 
we invest primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and short term securities with a p ratings 
we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediate term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes 
we manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
all investments held as of may  are traded in active markets 
since september  our primary short term investment vehicle has been us agency discount notes 
in september  we sold all of our holdings of vrdns and prime money market funds as a result of turmoil in the related markets 
no losses were recognized on those sales 
the proceeds from the sales of these investments were reinvested in us agency discount notes 
since then  we have seen gradual improvement in liquidity in certain money market sectors  and starting in november we began to invest in select a p rated vrdns 
during fiscal  we earned an after tax rate of approximately for vrdns compared to approximately for us agency discount notes 
we have no exposure to high risk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities  sub prime mortgage securities  asset backed securities or asset backed commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds  or structured investment vehicles sivs 
we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
during fiscal  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was  compared with for fiscal and for fiscal with the turmoil in the financial markets  our conservative investment strategy has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments 
when interest rates are falling  the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and long term interest rate changes 
during a falling interest rate environment  the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short term investments  and over time decrease earnings from our longer term available for sale securities 
earnings from the available for sale securities  which as of may  had an average duration of years  would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 
in the next twelve months  slightly over of our available for sale portfolio will mature  and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 
the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities that had stated maturities as of may  are shown below by contractual maturity 
expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 
may  in millions amortized cost fair value maturity date due in one year or less due after one year through three years due after three years through five years due after five years total vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically to years 
although these securities are issued as long term securities  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

table of contents the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate decrease first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields end of fiscal year the federal funds rate was a range of zero to as of may  and may  calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale securities  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous  and financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 
subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions  a basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately billion for fiscal our anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities and available for sale securities with an average duration of less than days  and invested in available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 
the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of million as of may   compared with a net unrealized gain of million as of may  during fiscal  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from million to million 
during fiscal  the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of million to a net unrealized gain of million 
the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately million as of july  as of may  and may   we had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at fair value 
the weighted average yield to maturity was and as of may  and may   respectively 
the weighted average yield to maturity excludes available for sale securities tied to short term interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may  we held no vrdns as of may  assuming a hypothetical decrease in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available for sale securities as of may   would be approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value 
this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity 
these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations  unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other than temporary and an impairment loss recognized 

table of contents credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns 
we believe that the investments we held as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired 
while million of our available for sale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost  we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms  and that the decline in the fair value to million below amortized cost was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns 
all of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may  and the majority of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may  held an aa rating or better 
we intend to hold these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity  and further believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these investments prior to that time 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment
