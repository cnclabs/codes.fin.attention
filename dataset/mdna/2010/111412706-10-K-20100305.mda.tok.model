overview since  broadvision has been a pioneer and consistent innovator of e business solutions 
we deliver a combination of technologies and services into the global market that enable customers of all sizes to power mission critical web initiatives that ultimately deliver high value to their bottom line 
our offering consists of a robust framework for personalization and self service  modular applications and agile toolsets that customers use to create e commerce  portal solutions  and enterprise social networks 
as of december   we had licensed our products to more than companies including audible 
com  baker hughes  biorad laboratories  bnp paribas  canon  efg bank  epson america  fiat  hilti  indian railway catering and tourism company  ing bank  laposte  mettler toledo  office of controller general of defence accounts government of india  oreck corporation  petco  prime polymer  standard bank of argentina  sony computer entertainment inc  thomas cook india ltd  us air force  vodafone  us grainger and xerox 
our objective is to further our position as a global supplier of web based  self service applications 
this will require us to continue to build new functionality into our applications that offer our customers a compelling value proposition to license our products rather than design and build custom solutions 
we generate revenue from fees for licenses of our software products  and related maintenance  consulting services and customer training 
we generally charge fees for licenses of our software products either based on the number of persons registered to use the product or based on the number of cpus utilized by the machine on which the product is installed 
payment terms are generally days from the date the products are delivered  the maintenance contract is booked or the consulting services are provided 
from to  we incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations 
in fiscal years and  we incurred significant cash usage related to the termination of excess real estate obligations  certain reductions in workforce and the execution and subsequent termination of an acquisition agreement 
although we generated net income in year and and net loss in year due to goodwill impairment  our ability to generate profits or positive cash flows in future periods remains uncertain 
we strive to anticipate changes in the demand for our services and aggressively manage our labor force appropriately 
as part of our budgeting process  cross functional management participates in the planning  reviewing and managing of our business plans 
this process is intended to allow us to adjust our cost structures to changing market needs  competitive landscapes and economic factors 
our emphasis on cost control helps us manage our margins even if revenues generated fall short of our expectations 
our operations in faced two challenges severe worldwide recession and continued consolidation of the enterprise software industry 
consequently  revenues from our existing products declined over we managed these challenges by rigorously controlling costs to operate profitably despite lower revenues  diligently caring for and serving our installed base to improve customer loyalty  and heavily investing in new products  most notably the cloud based clearvale enterprise social network 
in february  we announced a subscription rights offering to existing stockholders 
the primary purpose of the rights offering was to allow the holders of broadvision common stock on the record date an opportunity to further invest in broadvision in order to maintain their proportionate interest in broadvision common stock  at the same price per share as the per share price afforded to our chief executive officer  founder and largest stockholder  dr 
pehong chen  in connection with a transaction in which we issued shares to dr 
chen in exchange for the cancellation of notes he held 
the rights offering expired on november  eligible participants exercised rights to purchase million shares  resulting in million in net proceeds 
we deregistered the shares not sold in the rights offering and subject to the registration statement we filed in connection with the rights offering 
then we reduced our total number of authorized shares of common stock from  to  in february dr 
chen s ownership was approximately as a result of closing the rights offering in the fourth quarter of as of december   dr 
chen s ownership was approximately 
in order to complete the issuance of shares to dr 
chen without violating nasdaq applicable listing standards  we delivered to nasdaq a notification of voluntary delisting of broadvision common stock from the nasdaq national market effective prior to the opening of trading on march  effective as of the opening of trading on october   we effected a one for twenty five reverse split of our common stock 
as of november   we transferred the quotation of our common stock from the otc bulletin board to the nasdaq global market under the trading symbol bvsn 
in june  william meyer resigned as our chief financial officer  a position mr 
meyer had held since april dr 
chen has served as chief financial officer on an interim basis until january when dr 
shin yuan tzou was appointed to this position 
in late  we broadened our business model with the introduction of our first product that is offered to customers through a licensing model known as software as a service  or saas 
saas  which has gained popularity in recent years  is a different way of commercializing computer software than the enterprise license model that we and most other software vendors have traditionally used 
in the saas model  instead of licensing software to customers for use on their computers  the software is operated  or hosted  on the vendor s own computers  and customers are allowed to access and utilize the software remotely in return for the payment of one time or recurring subscription fees 
on november   broadvision delaware llc  a delaware limited liability company bvd  which was then our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a share purchase agreement with chrm llc  a delaware limited liability company  and we and chrm llc then entered into an amended and restated operating agreement of broadvision delaware llc dated as of november  the bvd operating agreement 
under these agreements  chrm llc received  in exchange for the assignment of certain intellectual property rights  class b shares of bvd  representing the right to receive of any net profit from a capital transaction as such terms are defined in the bvd operating agreement of broadvision barbados limited bvb 
a capital transaction under that agreement is any merger or sale of substantially all of the assets of bvb as a result of which the members of bvb will no longer have an interest in bvb or the assets of bvb will be distributed to its members 
change in filer status commencing with this annual report on form k  we are no longer deemed to be an accelerated filer as defined in rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended because our public float was below the required threshold as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter of as a result of becoming a non accelerated filer  we are not required to provide an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting 
we have elected to not include such an attestation report in this annual report  which election was approved by the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of our financial conditions and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivable reserves  stock based compensation  investments  impairment assessments  income taxes and restructuring  as well as contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview our revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products  maintenance  consulting services and customer training 
we generally charge fees for licenses of our software products either based on the number of persons using the product or based on the number of cpus on which the product is installed 
licenses for software for which fees are charged based upon the number of persons using the product include licenses for development use and licenses for use by registered users of the customer s website deployment use 
licenses for software for which fees are charged on a per cpu basis differentiate between development and deployment usage 
our revenue recognition policies comply with asc  software revenue recognition asc  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab 
we apply the separation criteria in asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc  to determine whether our arrangements with multiple deliverables should be treated as separate units of accounting 
asc indicates that revenue recognized for any multiple element contract is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element 
the determination of the fair value of each element is based on our analysis of objective evidence from comparable sales of the individual element 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
for the fixed or not to exceed fees contracts  revenues are recognized based on asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts asc 
we estimate the proportional performance on contracts on a basis of utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
software license revenue we license our products through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers and application service providers asp 
in general  software license revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier 
in case of electronic delivery  delivery occurs when the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
for products that cannot be used without a licensing key  the delivery requirement is met when the licensing key is made available to the customer 
if collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
subscription based license revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of list prices 
we do not grant resellers the right of return 
we recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of asc revenues recognized from multiple element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements  such as licenses for software products  maintenance  consulting services or customer training 
the determination of fair value is based on vendor specific objective evidence  which is specific to us 
we limit our assessment of objective evidence for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we have not yet adopted accounting standards update asu an update to asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asu  and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we record unearned revenue for software license agreements when cash has been received from the customer and the agreement does not qualify for revenue recognition under our revenue recognition policy 
we record accounts receivable for software license agreements when the agreement qualifies for revenue recognition but cash or other consideration has not been received from the customer 
services revenue consulting services revenues and customer training revenues are recognized as such services are performed 
maintenance revenues  which include revenues bundled with software license agreements that entitle the customers to technical support and future unspecified enhancements to our products  are deferred and recognized ratably over the related agreement period  generally twelve months 
our consulting services  which consist of consulting  maintenance and training  are delivered through the broadvision global services bvgs organization 
in january  we renamed bvgs to worldwide e business solution organization webso 
in order to support our customers expanded needs relating to recently launched products  webso involves more internal departments than did the bvgs organization 
the services that we provide are not essential to the functionality of the software 
we record reimbursement from our customers for out of pocket expenses as an increase to services revenues 

table of contents receivable reserves occasionally  our customers experience financial difficulty after we record the sale but before payment has been received 
we maintain receivable reserves for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our normal payment terms are generally to days from the invoice date 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make the contractual payments  additional reserves may be required 
losses from customer receivables in the three year period ended december   have not been significant 
if all efforts to collect a receivable fail  and the receivable is considered uncollectible  we would write off against the receivable reserve 
research and development and software development costs asc  costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed asc  requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model 
to date  costs incurred by us between the completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have been insignificant 
accordingly  we have charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred 
impairment assessments as of december   we performed a goodwill impairment analysis and no impairment was deemed necessary at december  in the year ended december   we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million  which represented a full write off of our remaining goodwill balance in accordance with the requirements of asc  goodwill asc 
as of december   we performed step under the provisions of asc by determining that we have a single reporting unit and then comparing our net book value to our market capitalization based upon the quoted market price of our stock 
based upon the results of step  which showed impairment indicators of our goodwill balance  we completed step and recognized an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended december  we had no goodwill or identifiable intangible assets as of december  income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes are computed using an asset and liability approach in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of the enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  is not expected to be realized 
we analyze our deferred tax assets with regard to potential realization 
we have established a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to the extent that management has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized based upon the uncertainty of their realization 
we consider the effects of estimated future taxable income  current economic conditions and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted asc  compensation stock compensation asc  using the modified prospective transition method 
under asc  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated pre vesting forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we adopted the alternative transition method provided in asc for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to asc in the fourth quarter of fiscal the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of asc the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we did not recognize any significant share based employee compensation costs in our statements of operations prior to january   as options granted to employees and non employee members of the board of directors generally had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
prior to the adoption of asc  we provided pro forma disclosure of net income loss applicable to common stockholders as if the fair value based method had been applied 
in the pro forma information for periods prior to  we accounted for pre vesting forfeitures as they occurred 
our operating results for prior periods have not been restated 
for our one for twenty five reverse stock split event effective on october   we were not required to recognize any incremental compensation cost for this equity restructuring 
based on asc  if an award is adjusted based on an existing antidilution provision that requires adjustment in the event of an equity restructuring  and is properly structured to preserve the value of the awards upon completion of the equity restructuring  incremental fair value generally should not result from the modification 
our equity restructuring did not result in any additional compensation expense related to our equity awards 
further details related to our stock benefit plans and our adoption of asc are provided in note stockholders equity in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents restructuring through december   we have approved restructuring plans to  among other things  reduce our workforce and consolidate facilities 
restructuring and asset impairment charges were taken to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization 
our restructuring charges are comprised primarily of i severance and benefits termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce  ii lease termination costs and or costs associated with permanently vacating our facilities  iii other incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan  and iv impairment costs related to certain long lived assets abandoned 
we account for each of these costs in accordance with sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges sab 
excess facilities costs 
we account for excess facilities costs as follows l for exit or disposal activities initiated on or prior to december   we account for lease termination and or abandonment costs in accordance asc exit or disposal cost obligations asc 
accordingly  we recorded the costs associated with lease termination and or abandonment when the leased property had no substantive future use or benefit to us 
l for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   we account for lease termination and or abandonment costs in accordance with asc  which requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured initially at fair value on the cease use date of the facility 
severance and termination costs and excess facilities costs we record under these provisions are not associated with nor do they benefit continuing activities 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
in determining the charges related to the restructurings to date  the majority of estimates made by management have related to charges for excess facilities 
in determining the charges for excess facilities  we were required to estimate future sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates have related to the timing and extent of future sublease income in which to reduce our lease obligations 
we based our estimates of sublease income  in part  on the opinions of independent real estate experts  current market conditions and rental rates  an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made  the status of negotiations with potential subtenants  and the location of the respective facility  among other factors 
we have recorded the low end of a range of assumptions modeled for restructuring charges 
adjustments to the facilities accrual will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
we will review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to our restructuring obligations in current operations based on management s most current estimates 
during  one of our leases located in redwood city  california expired 
we incurred an asset retirement obligation of  before returning the property back to the landlord 
we also reversed  in severance accruals due to the expiration of the statute of limitations related to these accruals  which was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in in our consolidated statements of operations 
during  there were no restructuring charges related to severance and benefits termination costs 
we recognized restructuring credits in the amount of  due to sublease income in excess of rent expense we incurred during the year during  we signed a sublease termination and release agreement the sublease termination agreement with our subtenant dexterra inc under the terms of the sublease termination agreement  dexterra inc was to i surrender the premises  on an as is basis  and all of its rights and interest in the premises  ii pay a termination fee to us and iii be entitled to a partial refund of the termination fee if any party subleases the office space during the period from june  through january  in addition to the termination fee  we retained dexterra inc s security deposit of  the termination fee of  less the retained security deposit of  is payable in two installments 
dexterra inc paid the first installment of  to us on june   and shall pay the second installment of  on june   subject to certain conditions set forth in the sublease termination agreement 
the second installment of the termination fee is being amortized into restructuring charges over the remaining term of the lease  which will expire on june  because of the early termination of our sublease agreement  we recalculated our restructuring liability in accordance with asc as a result  we recognized restructuring charges of  as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of march   the  square feet of formerly subleased space remains vacant 
we are making the lease payments and paying operating expenses  and actively seeking to sublease the space

it is likely that our operating results in one or more future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock almost certainly would decline 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu an update to asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asu  which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after june   however  early adoption is permitted 
in arrangements with multiple deliverables  asu permits entities to use management s best estimate of selling price to value individual deliverables when those deliverables have never been sold separately or when third party evidence is not available 
in addition  any discounts provided in multiple element arrangements will be allocated on the basis of the relative selling price of each deliverable 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the provisions of asu in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codificationtm the codification which was effective for us in the third quarter ended september  the codification became the single authoritative source for us gaap

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we had no derivative financial instruments as of december  and we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards and the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments we consider all debt and equity securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
short term investments consist of debt and equity securities that have a remaining maturity of less than one year as of the date of the balance sheet 
cash and cash equivalents that serve as collateral for financial instruments such as letters of credit are classified as restricted cash 
restricted cash in which the underlying instrument has a term of greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as non current 
management determines the appropriate classification of short term investments at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date 
all short term investments to date have been classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
our short term investments contractual maturities are before november total realized gains during fiscal years and were  and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents  and restricted cash consisted of the following as of december  and in thousands classified on consolidated balance sheet as purchase amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses aggregate fair value cash and cash equivalents short term investment restricted cash  current restricted cash  non current as of december  cash and cash equivalents money market funds held to maturity securities short term bonds and certificates of deposit total as of december  cash and cash equivalents money market funds held to maturity securities short term bonds and certificates of deposit total concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and accounts receivable 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality institutions 
our management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and requires certain of these customers to provide security deposits or letters of credit 
cash deposits in foreign countries of approximately million are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the united states 
as part of our cash and investment management processes  we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions we use and we have not sustained any credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions 
from time to time  our financial instruments maintained in our foreign subsidiaries may be subject to political risks or instability that may arise in foreign countries where we operate 
at december   one customer in the medical device industry accounted for more than of our accounts receivable balance 
at december   no customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable balance 
for the year ended december   one customer in the retail industry accounted for of our total revenues

table of contents fair value of financial instruments effective january   we adopted the provision of asc  fair value measurement asc 
asc establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements by establishing a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
we measure the following financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis 
the fair value of these financial assets as of december  in thousands were as follows fair value measurements at reporting date using balance at december  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable input level total gains losses cash and cash equivalents short term investments total includes money market funds 
includes held to maturity bonds and certificates of deposit 
our financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
we believe the reported carrying amounts of our financial instruments approximates fair value  based upon the short maturity of cash equivalents  accounts receivable and payable  and based on the current rates available to us on short term investments 
foreign currency we license our products and maintain significant operations in foreign countries 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  principally the euro  british pound and japanese yen  relative to the united states dollar have impacted our operating results in the past and may do so in the future 
we expect that international licenses  maintenance and consulting revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies and do not currently engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 
equity investments our equity investments consist of equity investments in public and non public companies that are accounted for under either the cost method of accounting or the equity method of accounting 
equity investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting when we have a minority interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value when readily determinable market values exist or at cost when such market values do not exist 
adjustments to fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income unless the investments are considered permanently impaired in which case the adjustment is recorded as a component of other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
equity investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting when we have a minority interest and have the ability to exercise significant influence 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at cost with periodic adjustments to carrying value for equity in net income loss of the equity investee 
such adjustments are recorded as a component of other income  net 
any decline in value of our investments  which is other than a temporary decline  is charged to earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs 
these investments were either liquidated or written off in and a net gain of  was recorded 
there was no net gain or loss in in  we received approximately  cash related to investments we made and wrote off in prior years 
in  we received approximately  cash related to investments in prior years 
those investments were accounted for under the lower of cost or market method and were written off in prior years 
the gain is reported under other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
