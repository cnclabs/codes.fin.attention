item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
part i item business overview anadys pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patient care by developing novel medicines for the treatment of hepatitis c 
we believe hepatitis c represents a large and significant unmet medical need 
our objective is to contribute to an improved treatment outcome for patients with this serious disease 
we are currently focusing our efforts on the development of ana  a small molecule  non nucleoside inhibitor of the nsb polymerase for the treatment of hepatitis c 
we also have investigated ana  an oral  small molecule inducer of endogenous interferons that acts via the toll like receptor  or tlr  pathway in a phase i trial in hepatitis c 
our expertise is based on two distinct scientific approaches to treating disease 
with ana we are focused on developing a direct antiviral  meaning a product candidate that acts by directly interacting with  and blocking the function of  a component of the virus 
we discovered ana through an extensive structure based drug design program that focused on parameters we feel are critical for success in chronic viral diseases  including potency and sustained drug levels in blood 
with ana  the focus is to stimulate the patients own immune systems to block cells infected with the hepatitis c virus from further producing more virus particles and amplifying the infection 
ana stimulates the immune system through activating a key receptor on immune cells known as tlr our knowledge of tlr is buttressed by an extensive preclinical program exploring the pharmacology of this receptor and by previous clinical experience with other molecules that act via the tlr mechanism 
activation of the tlr receptor may also allow the patient s immune system to attack cancer cells 
accordingly  we have also investigated ana in a separate phase i trial for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer 
in june  we initiated a strategic restructuring to focus our operations on the development of ana  in particular the phase ii study of ana in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin 
as part of the restructuring  we suspended further development of ana the strategic restructuring resulted in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 
we retained the clinical development infrastructure required to conduct the phase ii study of ana  key capabilities directed toward pharmaceutical development and next generation non nucleosides and a streamlined administrative staff 
anadys retains all commercialization rights to both ana and ana  which were discovered at anadys 
ana ana is a direct antiviral that blocks the hepatitis c virus hcv ability to multiply by inhibiting the viral rna polymerase 
ana belongs to a class of direct antivirals referred to as non nucleosides 
we believe non nucleosides will become an important component of future combination regimens used to treat hcv infection  similar to the role played by non nucleoside inhibitors in hiv therapy 
ana has demonstrated positive antiviral response and a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the ongoing phase ii combination trial  as described below 
ana has also completed two long term chronic toxicology studies weeks duration in rats and weeks duration in monkeys with favorable results 
furthermore  ana has demonstrated the preclinical properties  including potency  pharmacokinetics and early safety  that we believe are prerequisites for successful development in the hcv area 

table of contents we are currently conducting a phase ii clinical trial of ana in combination with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin  which is the current standard of care soc for the treatment of hepatitis c 
the first dose cohort  receiving ana at mg twice daily bid  initiated dosing in september and has completed the week ana dosing portion of the trial 
the second dose cohort  receiving ana at mg bid  initiated dosing and fully enrolled in january in the ongoing phase ii study  treatment na ve previously untreated genotype patients are to receive ana or placebo in combination with soc for weeks at dose levels of mg bid or mg bid  each with a loading dose of mg bid on day one 
after week  patients are to continue receiving standard of care alone 
patients who achieve undetectable levels of virus at weeks four and will be randomized to stop all treatment at week or the primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who achieve undetectable levels of virus at week defined as complete early virological response  or cevr 
additional endpoints include safety and tolerability as well as the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of virus at week four defined as rapid virological response  or rvr 
patients will be followed for weeks after stopping therapy to determine the rate of sustained virological response  or svr 
approximately patients were to be and have been enrolled in this study with approximately patients receiving ana and receiving placebo at each dose level 
the study is being conducted at a number of clinical sites in the united states 
in december  we reported positive preliminary antiviral response and safety results at week four from the first dose cohort mg bid and in february  we reported positive preliminary antiviral response and safety results at week for this dose cohort 
of patients receiving ana at mg bid in combination with soc achieved undetectable levels of virus iu ml at week  referred to as rvr  and of patients receiving ana at mg bid in combination with soc achieved undetectable levels of virus iu ml at week  referred to as cevr 
we are currently dosing patients at mg bid and expect to analyze and release four week data from this dose cohort prior to the end of the first quarter of and expect to analyze and release week data from this dose cohort during the second quarter of we are in the early stages of phase ii drug development with ana substantial further investment will be necessary in order to progress ana beyond the events referenced above and through additional clinical testing before we will be able to seek regulatory approval 
ana ana is a novel  oral inducer of endogenous interferons that acts via the tlr pathway that we have investigated as a treatment for both hcv and cancer 
both the prodrug and its active substance were discovered  designed and synthesized by anadys scientists 
pharmacology studies have shown that ana can elicit desired immune responses and that components of the response can be modulated by both dose and schedule of administration 
we have also shown in our phase i hcv clinical study that ana can stimulate the immune system at a tolerated dose 
however  we have elected to suspend further development of ana in order to focus our resources on ana currently  we are not actively pursuing the development of ana for either indication  except to allow currently enrolled patients in the oncology trial described below to continue to receive ana until disease progression is observed 
further development of these programs will be contingent on obtaining additional resources allocated to such programs or entering into a collaborative or licensing arrangement around ana with a third party 
the activities we have completed to date with ana are part of early drug development 
in order for us to develop ana further  we will require substantial additional funding or support from a collaborator or licensee 
we do not have any plans to further the development of ana at this time 
if continued  substantial further investment would be necessary in order to progress ana beyond the events referenced above and through additional clinical testing before regulatory approval could be sought 
ana for hcv because interferon alpha is the foundation of the current standard of care for hepatitis c and the current development of direct antivirals is based on the addition of such direct antivirals to interferon based regimens  we believe that an oral agent that stimulates interferon production with improved tolerability could potentially displace interferon from future regimens that contain direct antivirals 
we believe that ana may offer the opportunity to be such an oral interferon replacement 

table of contents in we concluded a phase i clinical trial of ana in hcv patients 
in the final cohort of the trial  in which patients received mg of ana every other day over days  the mean maximal decline in viral load was log  compared to a mean maximal decline of log 
in patients who received placebo 
five of the eight patients who received mg ana experienced a maximal decline of greater than log  while none of the eight patients who received placebo experienced a decline of greater than log 
the mean end of treatment decline was log in patients who received mg ana compared to log in patients who received placebo 
ana was well tolerated in patients throughout the course of the study and there were no serious adverse events reported 
ana for cancer we have also investigated ana for the treatment of cancer in a phase i clinical trial that we initiated in we plan for currently enrolled patients to continue to receive ana until disease progression is observed and to conclude the trial once all patients reach this point 
through our experience with the development of ana for hcv  we have shown that ana can stimulate the human immune system at a tolerated dose and we continue to believe that ana holds promise as a therapy for cancer 
tlr agonists are of particular interest because there is precedent for their use in cancer and small molecule ligands for this receptor have been identified 
topical imiquimod aldara is approved for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma in the united states us  and has demonstrated activity against other tumor types including melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
immunotherapy is potentially synergistic with other treatment modalities and new approaches to manipulate conventional cancer therapies to work in concert with the immune system are being explored 
industry background hcv based on available market data  we estimate that the global hcv market in was between and billion 
due to significant global prevalence and substantial unmet medical need  improving the treatment of chronic hcv infection remains an important priority for the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry 
many patients with chronic hcv infection do not receive the current standard of care due to concerns about adverse events or have incomplete response to the current standard of care 
if untreated or inadequately treated  chronic hcv infection can result in significant liver damage cirrhosis  liver transplantation and liver cancer 
the world health organization who estimates that million persons globally are chronically infected with hcv and to million people are newly infected each year 
cirrhosis develops in about to of people with chronic infection  and liver cancer develops in to of people with chronic infection over a period of to years 
it is estimated that more than million people are chronically infected with hcv in the us and that only about  of these patients are currently under treatment 
the national institutes of health estimates that hcv results in  to  deaths in the us annually and the center for disease control and prevention estimates that the number of deaths could increase to nearly  by hcv also exacerbates the severity of underlying liver disease when it coexists with other hepatic conditions 
in particular  liver disease progresses more rapidly among persons with alcoholic liver disease and hiv infection 
there is currently no vaccine available to prevent infection with hcv 
the current standard of care for treatment of chronic hcv infection is a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin 
interferon alpha is administrated by injection and results in abnormally high levels of this cytokine circulating systemically throughout the body 
therapy with interferon alpha causes a number of side effects in many patients  including depression  drops in blood cell count and flu like symptoms  sometimes experienced during the entire year long primary course of therapy that is standard for treatment of patients infected with genotype hcv  the most difficult patient group to treat 
these side effects may make patients feel worse than foregoing treatment  which reduces their motivation to initiate or continue hcv therapy 
many patients take additional drugs to treat these side effects  further increasing the cost and the risk of additional side effects to the patient 
as a result  poor compliance with the hcv course of therapy may decrease the patient response rate 
in addition to the side effects  current therapies do not provide sustained elimination of the virus  called sustained virologic response svr  for a large proportion of chronically infected patients 
for example  in clinical trials  approximately percent of the genotype patients  which represent the largest portion of hcv patients in the us  europe and japan  do not achieve sustained virologic response six months after the end of the treatment 
due to the lack of alternative treatments  patients without a sustained virologic response have no other treatment option but to undergo a second week course of interferon alpha based therapy with a different brand of interferon alpha 
this second course of therapy subjects the relapsed patient to a similar risk of side effects as the previous course of therapy and offers the benefit of svr in only a small fraction of patients who complete the week treatment 

table of contents in response to the limitations of existing treatments for hcv infection  direct antiviral therapies including protease  polymerase and nsa inhibitors have emerged as a potential addition to or alternative to the current standard of care 
unlike interferons  which work by stimulating the immune system s response to viral infection  hcv direct antivirals directly target the virus by inhibiting the protease  polymerase or nsa region of the virus 
accordingly  direct antivirals have the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes  when added to the standard of care in difficult to treat patients  including patients infected with hcv genotype the addition of direct antivirals to the standard of care could also lead to shorter treatment duration  which could increase patient compliance 
while direct antivirals will likely initially be used in combination with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin  it may be possible eventually to replace one or both components of the current treatment regimen with a combination of oral therapies directed at hcv  including protease  polymerase and nsa inhibitors 
quantification of viral concentration viral load in the blood is an accepted surrogate of clinical effect in viral diseases 
new treatments are evaluated on the ability to decrease or eliminate detectable viral particles in blood 
with viral load as an accepted surrogate  proof of concept in the treatment of viral diseases can be obtained in phase i human clinical trials 
we believe this early proof of concept results in a higher probability of success post phase i than the probability of success associated with drug development in many other therapeutic areas 
cancer cancer remains a disease with significant unmet medical need 
each year  an estimated million people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer and more than half will eventually die from their disease 
according to the american cancer society  the number of new cancer cases in the united states is projected at million for  and approximately one out of every two men  and one out of every three women  will develop cancer during his or her lifetime 
cancer accounts for nearly one quarter of all deaths in the united states  exceeded only by heart disease 
cancer treatment today current treatments for cancer include surgery  chemotherapy  and radiation  as well as small molecules  antibodies  hormone therapy  and other targeted agents 
surgical and radiation treatments are limited in their effectiveness because they treat the tumor at a specific site  may not remove all the cancer cells  and are not effective if the cancer has spread beyond its initial site 
chemotherapy can treat the cancer at multiple sites  but causes severe side effects because it destroys healthy cells and tissues as well as cancer cells 
in many cases  chemotherapy can only reduce tumors in size and not eliminate them completely  resulting in disease recurrence 
targeted molecular therapies  including antibody and small molecule therapies  have shown promise  but typically are most effective for only subsets of the patient population 
furthermore  all drug therapies  both new and old  have been vulnerable to the emergence of tumor resistance and disease recurrence 
several clinical observations support the importance of tumor immune surveillance in humans 
the increased risk of tumor development in immunosuppressed patients  cases of spontaneous tumor regression and the presence of tumor reactive t cells and b cells correlating with improved prognosis all point to a role for the immune system in controlling tumor growth 
immunotherapy has had success in treating certain tumors and this approach remains of interest for improving cancer treatment options 
immunotherapy is potentially synergistic with other treatment modalities and new approaches to manipulate conventional cancer therapies to work in concert with the immune system will be explored 
rational combinations and sequences of therapy  coupled with treatment strategies based on emerging understanding of immunobiology  may result in therapies that control and or eradicate established cancer 
toll like receptors toll like receptors or tlrs are a relatively new scientific discovery  though their origins date back hundreds of millions of years 
tlrs evolved as a way to protect organisms against pathogens such as viruses and bacteria 
this defense mechanism has proven so effective that it is an integral part of the human immune system today and a promising target for innovative new medicines 
in  the first human tlr was cloned 
to date  scientists have discovered tlrs in humans  each recognizing generic molecular patterns associated with a variety of invading pathogens 

table of contents tlr agonists in viral diseases certain tlrs are responsible for fighting bacterial and fungal infections  others respond specifically to viral infections 
unlike adaptive immunity  which enables the immune system to remember and fight specific infections that it has encountered before  innate immunity is the ability to recognize foreign invaders upon their very first meeting 
this function is regulated in part by tlrs  a family of proteins that serve as a first line of defense in the body 
once a tlr recognizes a particular pathogen  it launches a dual assault 
first  it triggers the body s innate immunity  initiating an inflammatory response to fight the invader that includes induction of interferon  a natural disease fighter that is the basis for many approved products 
it then alerts and educates the body s adaptive immune system so that it will recognize the pathogen in the future 
if tlrs fail  the body is left vulnerable to infection 
tlr agonists in cancer as key regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses  tlrs have been shown in research studies to affect several diseases  including cancer 
clinical studies have demonstrated that activation of tlr is effective in treating certain cancers that appear on the skin 
specifically  topical imiquimod aldara is approved for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma 
unfortunately  however  imiquimod is poorly tolerated when administered orally  limiting its utility for broader indications requiring systemic exposure 
additional justification for the investigation of tlr agonists for the treatment of cancer comes from the many studies conducted with tlr agonists 
tlr and tlr agonists share common signaling pathways  partially overlap in cell type expression  and have comparable direct and indirect activities as immunostimulants 
a large body of data exists from animal models and human studies suggesting the potential utility of appropriately modified natural agonists of tlr either in monotherapy or combination therapy for the treatment of cancer 
tlr and tlr agonists are  however  administered differently to patients tlr agonists can be administered orally  while tlr agonists are thus far only injectable 
our strategy the key elements of our strategy include the following advance the development of ana in hcv 
we are developing ana  a non nucleoside inhibitor of the hcv nsb polymerase 
during we intend to o obtain week data from the mg bid cohort in the phase ii clinical trial in hcv infected patients  o obtain week data from the mg bid cohort in the phase ii clinical trial in hcv infected patients  and o obtain initial svr data from patients able to stop soc at week pursue the development of novel  high quality product candidates in major disease areas 
we select our product candidates based on demonstrated properties that suggest the potential to change treatment paradigms and become important products in time 
our strategy is to couple high quality candidates with a disciplined investment approach  pursuing time and cost efficient paths to obtaining clinical data 
during we intend to identify a non nucleoside inhibitor of the hcv nsb polymerase as a pre clinical candidate that could be suitable as a next generation agent to follow ana opportunistically explore strategic alliances around our product candidates 
we intend to explore potential strategic alliances and other transactions around ana and ana we currently have no ongoing collaborations 

table of contents our development programs ana for hcv ana is a direct antiviral that blocks the hepatitis c virus ability to multiply by inhibiting the viral rna polymerase 
ana belongs to a class of direct antivirals referred to as non nucleosides 
we believe non nucleosides will become an important component of future combination regimens used to treat hcv infection  similar to the role played by non nucleoside inhibitors in hiv therapy 
in we selected ana as a development candidate 
this selection represented the culmination of a comprehensive structure based drug design program directed towards the viral rna polymerase 
ana has demonstrated positive antiviral response and a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the ongoing phase ii combination trial  as described below 
ana has also completed two long term chronic toxicology studies weeks duration in rats and weeks duration in monkeys with favorable results 
furthermore  ana has demonstrated the preclinical properties  including potency  pharmacokinetics and early safety  that we believe are prerequisites for successful development in the hcv area 
we believe that non nucleoside nsb polymerase inhibitors offer an exciting potential new way to target treating hcv infection  as part of combination regimens which may include other direct antivirals such as protease inhibitors  nucleoside polymerase inhibitors and or nsa inhibitors and or immunomodulators such as pegylated interferon 
we believe that polymerase inhibitors have the potential to be equally important components of future regimens as protease inhibitors  which is another class of hcv direct antivirals currently in clinical development by a number of companies  including vertex with mitsubishi and johnson johnson and merck 
historically  it has been challenging to identify non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors that display both potency and sustained drug levels in blood 
with ana  we believe we have created a product candidate that has the potential to overcome this challenge 
we believe that we have the opportunity to be competitive in the effort to develop non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors for the treatment of hcv  since  to our knowledge the number of non nucleosides in development is smaller than the number of potentially attractive combinations that can be formed with attractive protease inhibitors and nucleoside polymerase inhibitors in development 
we believe that the future evolution of hcv therapy will likely include protease inhibitors  nucleosides and non nucleosides used in various combinations 
therefore  we view ana as complementary to  rather than competitive with  protease inhibitors and nucleosides that are currently in development as hcv therapies 
preclinical evaluation of ana required for initiation of clinical investigation was completed in the first quarter of  leading to submission of an investigational new drug ind to the food and drug administration fda  subsequent allowance of the ind by the fda and initiation of clinical investigation in the second quarter of in december  we announced that the fda granted fast track designation to ana for the treatment of chronic hcv infection 
we have completed three phase i studies of ana that have demonstrated potent antiviral activity and good tolerability 
we are currently conducting a phase ii study of ana in combination with current standard of care 
in the ongoing phase ii study  treatment na ve genotype patients are to receive ana or placebo in combination with soc for weeks at dose levels of mg bid or mg bid  each with a loading dose of mg bid on day one 
after week  patients are to continue receiving soc alone 
patients who achieve undetectable levels of virus at weeks four and will be randomized to stop all treatment at week or the primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who achieve undetectable levels of virus at week defined as cevr 
additional endpoints include safety and tolerability as well as the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of virus at week four defined as rvr 
patients will be followed for weeks after stopping therapy to determine the rate of svr 
approximately patients were to be and have been enrolled in this study with approximately patients receiving ana and receiving placebo at each dose level 
the study is being conducted at a number of clinical sites in the united states 
in december  we reported positive initial antiviral response and safety results from the mg bid dose cohort based on a planned interim analysis of data at four weeks 
in the group receiving ana added to soc  there was a steady increase in the percentage of patients with undetectable levels of virus from week one through week four  with of patients achieving undetectable levels of virus defined as iu ml at week four  referred to as rvr  compared to of patients receiving placebo plus soc achieving an rvr 
in february  we reported positive preliminary antiviral response and safety results at weeks from the mg bid dose cohort 
of patients receiving ana at mg bid in combination with soc achieved undetectable levels of virus iu ml at week  referred to as cevr  compared to of patients receiving placebo plus soc achieving a cevr 
based on historical reports of cevr rates for soc control arms in larger hcv trials  which generally range from to  the seen in our mg bid dose cohort appears to be anomalously high and may be due to the small number of patients in the control arm 
also  the mg bid week data showed the ability for ana to significantly accelerate the rate of patients achieving undetectable levels of virus when added to current treatment 
in clinical trials with other agents  accelerating the rate of achieving undetectable levels of virus is associated with an increased chance of achieving a sustained viral response  or svr 
although we cannot predict whether this will be the case with ana  we hope to show the same benefit at the conclusion of this phase ii trial 
further  no patient in the mg bid dose cohort experienced viral rebound defined as an increase in viral load of greater than log from a prior measurement while receiving ana 
table of contents in the ongoing phase ii study  ana at mg bid demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile through weeks  although definitive conclusions regarding safety and tolerability cannot be made until additional results in more patients and potentially over longer duration are known 
there were no serious adverse events reported and the profile of adverse events reported was as expected for patients receiving soc alone  with comparable rates observed between the ana and control arms 
the incidence of rash was comparable between groups and consistent with historical reports of rash rates due to interferon and ribavirin 
in the ana arm  of patients developed a rash while of patients in the control group developed a rash 
eleven of the twelve instances of rash in the ana arm were mild 
one patient in the ana arm who had achieved undetectable levels of virus by week four developed a grade rash after week seven which began resolving rapidly upon stopping all study medication 
in this instance  the rash was characterized as grade due to the extent of body surface covered by the rash  which was maculopapular in nature red spots  some raised 
in accordance with the study design  this patient resumed interferon ribavirin alone  and continued in the study and maintained undetectable levels of virus through week the five instances of rash in the control arm were mild 
we are currently dosing patients at mg bid and expect to analyze and release four week data from this dose cohort prior to the end of the first quarter of and expect to analyze and release week data from this dose cohort during the second quarter of based on preliminary pharmacokinetic data from the mg bid dose cohort  which show ana levels in the patients blood through four weeks  it appears that the mg loading dose given twice on day one has had the desired effect of rapidly dropping viral load and minimizing the difference in response between a genotype and b genotype patients 
because this loading dose is also being administered to patients in the mg bid cohort  we expect to see a similar early response in patients receiving ana in that cohort 
from the data seen to date  it is also apparent that patients in the mg bid cohort achieved undetectable levels of virus after four weeks of dosing even when the level of ana in their blood was among the lowest levels observed across patients 
accordingly  it may be that  for a substantial number of patients  the antiviral response will plateau at mg bid when administered with an effective loading dose  and that we may not see an increase in antiviral response in the mg bid cohort 
if this turns out to be the case and if mg bid is identified as the optimal dose to take forward in future clinical trials  we believe that the favorable profile we have seen at the low dose of mg bid will facilitate combining ana with other direct antivirals 
in january and april  we announced data from the ana phase i study in which ana was dosed as monotherapy over three days in hcv patients at twice daily doses of mg  mg or mg 
the data from the study demonstrated potent antiviral activity and good tolerability of ana as a single agent at all dose levels 
the median viral load reduction over three days ranged from to log in the three dose groups studied 
no patient at any dose level showed evidence of viral rebound while on ana and there were no serious adverse events reported 
also in april  we reported results from a day study of ana in healthy volunteers 
ana was generally well tolerated in all cohorts in the healthy volunteer study with no serious adverse events 
three instances of mild to moderate rash were observed at the higher dose levels 
pharmacokinetic results from this trial confirmed the plasma half life of ana of approximately hours  and demonstrated that steady state levels of ana in plasma are reached after six to seven days of dosing 
during we also completed two long term chronic toxicology studies of ana weeks duration in rats and weeks duration in monkeys with favorable results 
the completed toxicology studies confirm the favorable toxicology profile of ana and support dosing durations of as long as one year if desirable in future clinical studies 
in  we presented in vitro data showing that combinations of ana with interferon alpha  the protease inhibitor telaprevir and the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor psi appear to be synergistic 
synergistic means that the actual combined effect of the two agents is greater than would be predicted from simply adding the effects of each agent alone 
these studies also show that ana retained activity in vitro against mutants known to confer resistance to other classes of direct antivirals  including protease inhibitors  nucleoside inhibitors and non nucleosides that  through virtue of binding at a different site than ana  display a resistance profile distinct from that of ana we also showed that genotypic mutations resistant to ana appear to be fully susceptible to interferon alpha  telaprevir and psi previously  we have also presented data demonstrating synergy between ana and immunoregulatory proteins termed cytokines induced by ana  anadys tlr agonist oral prodrug which has also been investigated for hepatitis c 
ana for hcv because interferon alpha is the foundation of the current standard of care for hepatitis c and the current development of direct antivirals is based on the addition of such direct antivirals to interferon based regimens  we believe that an oral agent that stimulates interferon production with improved tolerability could potentially displace interferon from future regimens that contain direct antivirals 
we believe that ana may offer the opportunity to be such an oral interferon replacement 

table of contents in we concluded a phase i clinical trial of ana in hcv patients 
in the first three cohorts of the patient portion of this trial  hcv patients received oral ana or placebo at every other day over days  at doses of mg  mg or mg  with six subjects receiving ana and two receiving placebo in each cohort 
at these doses  data showed an encouraging trend toward viral load reduction 
we then amended the protocol to provide for a higher dose 
in this final cohort of the trial  in which patients received mg of ana every other day over days  the mean maximal decline in viral load was log  compared to a mean maximal decline of log in patients who received placebo 
five of the eight patients who received mg ana experienced a maximal decline of greater than log  while none of the eight patients who received placebo experienced a decline of greater than log 
the mean end of treatment decline was log in patients who received mg ana compared to log in patients who received placebo 
ana was well tolerated in patients throughout the course of the study and there were no serious adverse events reported 
results from pre clinical pharmacology studies showed that ana elicited desired immune responses and that the profile of response could be modulated by both dose and schedule of administration 
results of week glp toxicology studies showed that with every other day dosing of ana  immune stimulation of a magnitude believed to confer therapeutic potential could be achieved without adverse toxicology findings 
the immune stimulation observed with every other day dosing of ana in monkeys included induction of interferon alpha and interferon dependent responses at levels that were sustained over weeks of dosing 
ana for cancer we have also investigated ana as a potential treatment for cancer 
ana stimulates the body s immune system through activation of the tlr receptor 
through our experience with the development of ana for hcv we have shown that ana can stimulate the human immune system at a tolerated dose 
the pharmacologic consequences of tlr activation are broad and include induction of cytokines such as interferon alpha as well as activation of immune effector cell populations known as natural killer nk cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls 
the cytokine induction and cellular activation mechanisms both offer the potential for direct control of tumor cell growth 
furthermore  there is evidence to support the concept that activation of nk and ctl cells may be beneficial in enhancing the effect of existing cancer therapies  including monoclonal antibodies and certain chemotherapies 
there is a degree of precedent to support the use of the tlr mechanism in cancer 
one marketed product that works by stimulating the immune system via the tlr mechanism is imiquimod aldara 
while the fda approved indications for imiquimod are limited to topical treatment of skin diseases  such as superficial basal cell carcinoma  actinic keratosis and warts induced by the human papillomavirus  there are several reports of imiquimod demonstrating activity against skin metastases from solid tumors  such as breast cancer 
however  to date no one has successfully developed an oral tlr agonist for cancer 
we believe the combination of our prodrug approach  described below  and our understanding of tlr pharmacology provides us an opportunity to utilize the tlr mechanism to systemically treat a broad spectrum of cancers  including solid tumors and b cell diseases  with oral administration of ana ana is a prodrug of an active tlr agonist we believe may confer benefit in cancer treatment 
as a prodrug  ana itself does not activate the tlr receptor 
rather  the body s metabolic processes transform ana to an active form after absorption from the digestive tract  resulting in the active tlr agonist circulating in the blood 
both ana and the active agent it delivers were designed and synthesized by our scientists 
the use of a prodrug provides for efficient delivery of the active agent to the bloodstream and avoids undesirable effects of an active tlr agent in the digestive tract prior to absorption 
we have shown in multiple preclinical studies that oral delivery of ana produced the desired blood concentrations of the active agent and provided immune stimulation 
in our clinical investigations  we have administered ana orally 
we have reported the activity of ana and its active form at multiple scientific conferences 
in october  we presented data showing that activation of tlr in vivo by the active form of ana leads to the expected cellular responses  including activation of nk cells and ctls 
earlier in  we presented data from an in vitro study demonstrating that ana and its active metabolite stimulate secretion of interferon alpha and enhance direct tumor cell killing by nk cells 
in addition to enhancing direct nk cell killing  the active metabolite of ana also enhanced the ability of rituximab  an antibody against cd  to trigger immune mediated cell killing of transformed b cells 
we have also presented data from in vivo preclinical studies showing that the schedule of administration had a significant effect on the profile of immune stimulation induced by ana alternating dosing with periods of no dosing led to more robust nk cell activation and more stable levels of interferon alpha induction  compared to chronic daily administration 
we anticipate that different dosing schedules may be required in different tumor settings if ana is pursued in the future as a therapy for cancer 

table of contents manufacturing and supply all of our manufacturing is out sourced to third parties  with control by our internal managers 
we rely on third party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of ana and ana for use in clinical trials 
we intend to continue this practice for any future clinical trials and large scale commercialization of ana and or ana both ana and ana are small molecule drugs 
historically  these drugs have been simpler and less expensive to manufacture than biologic drugs

we also rely upon trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology  inventions and improvements we consider important to our business  defend and enforce our patents  preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets  and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties

in addition  we hold patents and patent applications in the united states and foreign countries covering composition of matter and methods of use of certain other tlr agonists and tlr agonist prodrugs  with patent expiration dates beginning in we intend to continue using our scientific expertise to pursue and file patent applications on new developments with respect to uses  methods and compositions of matter in order to enhance our intellectual property position in our areas of therapeutic focus 
we intend to aggressively prosecute our patent applications and enforce and defend our patents and otherwise protect our proprietary technology 
although we believe our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage  the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may not be able to develop patentable products or processes  and may not be able to obtain patents from pending applications 
even if patent claims are allowed  the claims may not issue  or in the event of issuance  may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us 
any patents or patent rights that we obtain may be circumvented  challenged or invalidated by our competitors 

table of contents we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained 
our practice is to require our employees  consultants  outside scientific collaborators  sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or other relationships with us 
these agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed by or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
in the case of employees  the agreements generally provide that all discoveries  developments  inventions and other intellectual property conceived or reduced to practice by the individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property 
in the case of advisors and consultants  the agreements generally provide that all discoveries  developments  inventions  and other intellectual property conceived or reduced to practice by the individual as a result of performance of services for us and not resulting from research related to work supported by another entity with which the individual is party to a confidentiality agreement  shall be our exclusive property 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property  and may not provide an adequate remedy to us in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are very competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our product candidates  if approved for sale  will compete with existing therapies 
in addition  a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and medical conditions that we are targeting 
we believe that a significant number of drugs are currently under development and may become available in the future for the treatment of hcv and cancer 
due to the level of focus on developing treatments for these indications  ongoing research efforts are intense and new treatments are being sought out and developed by our competitors 
some of these products use therapeutic approaches that may compete directly or indirectly with ana or ana in addition  less expensive generic forms of currently marketed drugs could lead to additional competition upon patent expiration or invalidations 
hcv treating hcv with interferon based therapies current standard treatments for hcv include an interferon based product combined with ribavirin 
although interferons result in antiviral effects  they are injectable products and cause numerous side effects 
next generation interferon based products  so called pegylated interferons  were developed to provide an improved dosing regimen and are approved as once per week injected products 
currently approved therapies for the treatment of hcv infection include peg intron pegylated interferon alpha b and intron a interferon alpha b  which are marketed by merck  pegasys pegylated interferon alpha a and roferon a interferon alpha a  which are marketed by roche and several branded and generic versions of ribavirin 
many patients experience unpleasant side effects when receiving interferon based products  including flu like symptoms such as fatigue  pyrexia  myalgia  cough  headache  and rigors  psychiatric reactions  such as depression  irritability and anxiety  as well as neutropenia and thyroid dysfunction 
due to the nature of hcv infection  patients may not show any symptoms from the hcv itself when they initiate therapy 
ironically  harsh side effects often make patients feel sicker than the disease itself 
as a result  physicians often delay treatment of hcv infected patients until tests of liver function demonstrate initial liver degeneration due to the infection 
in clinical studies  harsh side effects have caused discontinuation of treatment in approximately to percent of patients 
these side effects also require additional drug therapies  which increase the cost to the patient 
further  the optimal dose  treatment length and response rates to interferon and ribavirin therapy vary considerably based on hcv genotype and mode of therapy  ie  monotherapy or combination therapy 
direct antivirals in development for treating hcv in response to the limitations of existing treatments for hcv infection  the development of direct antiviral therapies including protease  polymerase and nsa inhibitors has emerged as a potential addition to or alternative to the standard treatment 
unlike interferons  which work by stimulating the immune system s response to viral infection  hcv direct antivirals directly target the virus by inhibiting the protease  polymerase or nsa region of the virus 
accordingly  direct antivirals may significantly improve treatment outcomes  when added to the standard of care in difficult to treat patients  including patients infected with hcv genotype  relative to treatment with the standard of care alone 
the addition of direct antivirals to the standard of care could also lead to shorter treatment duration  which could increase patient compliance 
while direct antivirals will likely initially be used in combination with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin  it may be possible eventually to replace one or both components of the current treatment regimen with a combination of oral therapies directed at hcv  including both protease and polymerase inhibitors 

table of contents ana belongs to a class of direct antivirals known as non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
if approved  ana would likely be used in combination with the current standard of care and or other direct antiviral agents such as protease inhibitors  other polymerase inhibitors  or nsa inhibitors 
although any product currently approved or approved in the future for the treatment of hcv infection could potentially decrease or eliminate the commercial opportunity of ana  we expect that in a combination setting a non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor would be complementary with a protease inhibitor  a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor and an nsa inhibitor 
we believe that other non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors would likely be the most direct competitors of ana  but depending on the resistance profiles of the compounds  it is possible that even two non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors could be complementary 
to our knowledge  other non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor programs are currently under clinical evaluation by pfizer  gilead  merck  abbott  boehringer ingleheim and vertex 
further  a number of companies have non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor research programs 
additional compounds in late stage clinical trials for hcv that may be complementary to or competitive with ana include zalbin joulferon albinterferon alfa b  in development by human genome sciences and novartis  telaprevir  in development by vertex pharmaceuticals  janssen pharmaceutica johnson johnson and mitsubishi tanabe pharma  boceprevir  narlaprevir and mk in development by merck  itmn  in development by intermune and roche  tmc  in development by tibotec and medivir  bi  in development by boehringer ingelheim  and rg in development by roche and pharmasset 
immunological agents in development for treating hcv due to the side effects and poor treatment response to interferon therapy discussed above  there are currently a number of agents in development that could potentially replace today s pegylated interferons 
ana is an oral prodrug of a tlr agonist that we have evaluated for the treatment of hcv 
there are a number of agents in clinical development that could potentially compete with ana as new agents for the treatment of hcv  including  zalbin joulferon albinterferon alfa b  in development by novartis and human genome sciences  and locteron  in development by biolex therapeutics  both of which are longer acting versions of interferon alfa 
also  in development as potential improvements to existing interferons are peg interferon lambda  in development by zymogenetics and bristol myers squibb  and omega interferon in development by intarcia therapeutics 
imo  a tlr agonist in development by idera  and sd  a tlr agonist in development by dynavax technologies are also being studied in early stage clinical trials in hcv patients 
cancer current treatments for cancer include surgery  chemotherapy  and radiation  as well as small molecules  antibodies  hormone therapy  and other targeted agents 
surgical and radiation treatments are limited in their effectiveness because they treat the tumor at a specific site  may not remove all the cancer cells  and are not effective if the cancer has spread beyond its initial site 
chemotherapy can treat the cancer at multiple sites  but causes severe side effects because it destroys healthy cells and tissues as well as cancer cells 
in many cases  chemotherapy can only reduce tumors in size and not eliminate them completely  resulting in disease recurrence 
targeted molecular therapies  including antibody and small molecule therapies  have shown promise  but typically are most effective for only subsets of the patient population 
furthermore  all drug therapies  both new and old  have been vulnerable to the emergence of tumor resistance and disease recurrence 
ana is a prodrug of a tlr agonist that we have evaluated for oncology indications 
any product currently approved or approved in the future for the treatment of cancer could decrease or eliminate the commercial opportunity of ana programs that most directly compete with ana at this time are several tlr agonists under evaluation for oncology indications  including imo  in development by idera and merck kgaa  and a cancer program in development by dynavax 
competitive risks we are in the early stages of a phase ii study of ana  which was initiated following completion of three short term phase i studies  and we have only conducted short term phase i studies of ana therefore  it is difficult to predict the efficacy  safety and tolerability that these product candidates will demonstrate in longer term trials  alone or in combination with other agents 
it is also difficult to predict how these product candidates will interact with other product candidates in development or on the market  until we perform combination studies 
further  it is difficult to predict whether our product candidates will cause any toxicity issues  potential side effects  or other negative consequences associated with their long term use 
during the course of future clinical trials  we may discover that these product candidates are less effective  require unacceptable dosing regimens  or have a similar side effect profile as the profile associated with current therapies or future competitors 
this may result in our product candidates being less advantageous or less desirable from a patient and treating physician perspective as compared to current therapies for hcv or cancer 

table of contents we face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies both in the us and abroad 
our competitors may utilize discovery technologies and techniques or partner with collaborators in order to develop products more rapidly or successfully than we or our future collaborators are able to do 
many of our competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and far more experience in the discovery and development of product candidates and the commercialization of potential products 
in addition  academic institutions  government agencies  and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies 
these organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors 
we believe that our ability to compete depends  in part  upon our ability to create  maintain and license scientifically advanced technology 
further  we need to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology 
we expect that competition among hcv and cancer therapies approved for sale will be based on various factors  including improved product efficacy  safety and tolerability  ease of administration eg  oral vs 
intravenous administration  availability  price  reimbursement status and patent position 
potential competitors may develop treatments for hcv or cancer that are more effective and or safer or more convenient than our product candidates or that would make our technology and product candidates obsolete or non competitive 
government regulations we are subject to regulation by the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries with respect to the development and commercialization of products and services resulting from our drug discovery activities 
these agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing  manufacture  quality control  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of these products and services 
as an initial step in the drug approval process of pharmaceuticals  an applicant typically conducts preclinical laboratory and animal studies of the product candidate 
following these studies  the applicant will submit an ind or equivalent application to the fda or comparable foreign regulatory agency 
once the ind becomes effective  the applicant can commence clinical studies of the product candidate in humans to determine safety  tolerability and efficacy 
following clinical studies  the marketing of a new drug requires the filing of a new drug application nda with the fda and its subsequent approval similar requirements exist within foreign agencies 
the process required by the fda and comparable agencies before a pharmaceutical or biologic device may be marketed in the us or in any other country generally requires many years and substantial effort and financial resources  and approval from the fda may not be received in a timely manner  if at all 
the time required to satisfy fda requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease 
even if a product receives regulatory approval  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
under the fda s regulations  the clinical testing program required for marketing approval of a new drug typically involves three sequential phases  which may overlap 
phase i studies are conducted on normal  healthy human volunteers or patients to determine safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
if possible  phase i studies may also be designed to gain early evidence of effectiveness 
phase ii studies are conducted on small groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease to gain preliminary evidence of efficacy  to determine the common short term side effects and risks associated with the substance being tested and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage 
phase iii involves large scale studies conducted on disease afflicted patients to provide statistical evidence of efficacy and safety and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling 

table of contents frequent reports are required in each phase  and  if unwarranted hazards to subjects are found  the fda may request modification or discontinuance of clinical testing until further preclinical testing is conducted 
additional testing phase iv may be conducted after fda approval for marketing is granted and could be designed to evaluate alternative utilizations of drug products prior to their being marketed for such additional utilizations as well as to test for complications resulting from long term exposure not revealed in earlier clinical testing 
environmental and safety matters certain of our development activities involve the controlled use of biological  hazardous and radioactive materials and waste 
we are also subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products 
the cost of compliance with and any violation of these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  we cannot assure investors that accidental contamination or injury from these materials will not occur 
to date  compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or our competitive position 
however  we are not able to predict the extent of government regulation  and the cost and effect thereof on our results of operations  which might result from any legislative or administrative action pertaining to environmental or safety matters 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for substantial damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources  and our clinical trials could be suspended 
in addition  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the discovery  preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
research and development expenses are the primary source of our expenses and totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

risk factors you should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below  together with the other information contained in this annual report and in our other public filings before making any investment decisions regarding our stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our common stock would likely decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
risks related to our business any significant set back regarding  or the failure of  ana will have a large negative impact on our business and stock price 
currently  we are actively pursuing only the development of ana as a result  our development portfolio entails a highly concentrated risk of failure 
if the timing or results of clinical trials and non clinical studies of ana do not meet our  your  analysts or others expectations  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
any significant set back regarding  or the failure of  ana will have a significant negative impact on us and our stock price 

table of contents we may be unable to enter into future strategic transactions  and in particular transactions around ana or ana  on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our near and long term viability will depend in part on our ability to successfully establish strategic transactions with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
since we do not currently possess the resources necessary to independently fully develop and commercialize ana or ana  we either will need to develop or acquire these resources on our own  which will require substantial funding  time and effort  or will need to enter into collaborative agreements to assist in the development and commercialization of these potential products 
if we fail to establish collaborations or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms  we may need to delay or terminate one or more of our programs 
even if we successfully establish new collaborations  these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any product candidates or the generation of sales or royalty revenue 
more specifically  we elected to initiate the phase ii study of ana prior to further exploring interest in a possible transaction around ana in addition  we plan to seek outlicensing opportunities as a way to potentially continue advancing the development of ana there is no guarantee that we will enter into a future transaction around ana or ana on favorable terms  or at all  or that discussions will initiate or progress on our desired timelines 
completing transactions of this nature is difficult and time consuming 
potentially interested parties may decline to re engage or may terminate discussions based upon their assessment of our competitive  financial  regulatory or intellectual property position or for any other reason 
furthermore  we may choose to defer consummating a transaction relating to ana until additional data is obtained 
if we do not actively pursue a transaction around ana until we have additional data  we and our stockholders will bear the risk that ana will fail prior to any future transaction 
we will need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed  which would force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our development programs 
our december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million 
we believe that this balance will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operational cash needs for at least the next months 
however  we will need to seek additional funding in order to conduct future development activities 
there is no guarantee that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs 
in addition  we will need to raise additional capital if we choose to conduct certain activities  including fund our development programs  acquire rights to products or product candidates  technologies or businesses  establish and maintain manufacturing  sales and marketing operations  and commercialize our product candidates  if any  that receive regulatory approval 
our future funding requirements will depend on  and could increase significantly as a result of many factors  including the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our nonclinical development activities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the pace and timing of development activities conducted under joint development arrangements we may establish  
table of contents the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory and commercialization of drug supply  the commercialization of ana  ana and any additional products  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products technologies and businesses 
we do not anticipate that we will generate significant revenues from operations for at least several years  if ever 
until we can generate significant revenues from operations  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  strategic alliances or other transactions  project financing and grant funding  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
raising additional funds by issuing securities or through debt or project financing or strategic alliances and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders  restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  project financings or strategic alliances and licensing arrangements 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders ownership will be diluted 
other financing activities may also have an equity component  which also may lead to dilution 
any debt or project financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
these restrictive covenants may include limitations on borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem capital stocks or make investments 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through strategic alliances and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
for example  we might be forced to relinquish all or a portion of our sales and marketing rights with respect to potential products or license intellectual property that enables licensees to develop competing products 
we are at an early stage of development  and we may never attain product sales 
our existing organizational structure was formed in may since then  most of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our proprietary drug discovery technologies  research and development and preclinical and early stage clinical testing of compounds 
our current product candidates are at only the very early stages of clinical trials 
ana  ana and any other compounds that we may develop  may never be approved for commercial sales 
these compounds will require extensive and costly development  preclinical testing and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory approval for commercial sales 
the time required to attain product sales and profitability is lengthy and highly uncertain  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or maintain product sales 
we expect our net losses to continue for at least several years  and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses and when we will become profitable in our business operations  if ever 
we have incurred net losses since our incorporation in  and through december  we have an accumulated deficit of million 
our losses are attributable in large part to the significant research and development costs required to identify and validate potential product candidates and conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials 
to date  we have generated limited revenues  consisting of one time or limited payments associated with past collaborations or grants  and we do not anticipate generating product revenues for at least several years  if ever 
we would need to increase our operating expenses over at least the next several years in order to fund the development costs of our product candidates and further our development activities 
as a result  over time  we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our research and product development efforts  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable in our business operations  if ever 
even if we do achieve profitability in our business operations  we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability on an ongoing basis 

table of contents the technologies on which we rely are unproven and may not result in the development of commercially viable products 
our current product candidates  ana and ana  were selected based on the presumption that intervention at their respective targets  hcv polymerase and tlr  offers a therapeutic benefit 
there can be no assurance that intervention at either target will offer sufficient benefit and acceptable toxicity to warrant continued development and approval 
ana relies on the biology of a specific receptor  or protein  named toll like receptor  or tlr however  the interaction between small molecules and tlr represents a relatively new mechanism of action for the treatment of disease  including hcv and cancer  and there is no guarantee that an acceptable balance between therapeutic benefit and risk will be achieved with tlr agonists in hcv infected patients or in cancer patients 
for example  in june we suspended dosing of ana  a tlr agonist prodrug  in our then on going ana clinical trial due to information from week toxicology studies in animals that showed intense immune stimulation 
we subsequently conducted additional pre clinical studies and were unable to identify an acceptable balance between therapeutic benefit and risk using a daily dosing schedule over weeks 
accordingly  we subsequently discontinued the development of ana as a therapy for hcv infection 
the science underlying ana is also new and unproven  as no products acting at the hcv polymerase have been approved for marketing 
ana and ana are at only the early stage of clinical investigation 
the process of successfully discovering product candidates is expensive  time consuming and unpredictable  and the historical rate of failure for drug candidates is extremely high 
if our approaches to drug discovery and development are not successful  we will not be able to establish or maintain a clinical development portfolio or generate product revenue 
because the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results  we can provide no assurances that ana or ana will have favorable results in future clinical trials  or receive regulatory approval 
positive results from preclinical studies or early clinical trials should not be relied upon as evidence that later or larger scale clinical trials will succeed 
there is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials 
there is no guarantee that viral load declines seen in early patient trials will be replicated in future trials of longer duration and or larger patient populations 
for example  short term viral load data from our ana phase ib study may not translate into long term benefit due to the potential emergence of resistant variants or other factors 
in particular  there is a perception by some within the scientific community that the administration of non nucleosides is more likely to result in resistance than the administration of other types of direct acting antivirals in development for hcv including protease inhibitors and nucleoside polymerase inhibitors due to the lower genetic barrier of resistance to non nucleosides relative to these other types of compounds  however  we and others within the scientific community believe that this concern is not likely to be a significant issue when non nucleosides are dosed in combination with other agents 
however  the outcome of this debate will not be known until data from longer term trials of non nucleosides dosed in combination with other agents become available 
similarly  there is no guarantee that favorable safety and tolerability seen in short term studies will be replicated in studies of longer duration and or in larger subject populations 
for example  in a day healthy volunteer study conducted in  three of the subjects who received ana discontinued from the study due to the onset of a skin rash during the study 
furthermore  if future toxicology studies have unexpected results  the clinical development of the compound at issue could be suspended  delayed and or terminated 
if ana  or any other product candidate  fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial or shows unexpected findings in future toxicology studies  we would experience potentially significant delays in  or be required to abandon  development of ana if we delay or abandon our development efforts related to ana  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to become profitable  and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged  each of which would cause our stock price to decrease significantly 
we intend to develop ana as a component of combination treatments  which presents additional challenges to the drug development process 
we are developing ana as a potential component of future combination treatments 
we may face additional challenges with this approach  as opposed to developing product candidates for monotherapy 
for example  any negative properties of our product candidates may be exacerbated when combined with other agents and or have unexpected effects in humans 
furthermore  the optimal development of our product candidates may entail explorations of combinations with other agents  which could require us to establish agreements or alliances with other companies or third parties 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into such alliances or agreements on terms that we view as favorable  or at all 
an important element of development for an agent such as ana will be to test the agent in combination with one or more other direct antivirals 
in order for us to pursue this development strategy  we will need to engage the interest of other biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies  since we do not have another direct antiviral to combine with ana our ability to engage this interest will be impacted by other companies internal hcv portfolio dynamics  with such dynamics influencing the companies perceived need to combine with an agent such as ana for those companies 
table of contents that have a perceived need to combine with an agent such as ana  we will be dependent on their perception of the profile of ana and their desire to test ana in combination with their agents 
if they do not view the profile of ana as favorably as we do  or if they establish other criteria for combination that we have not yet satisfied with ana  we could experience difficulties or delays in pursuing such combination trials 
if we are unable to optimize the development of ana  our business prospects could be harmed  causing our stock price to suffer 
there is no guarantee that in future studies of ana  in which ana may be dosed for longer duration in combination with other agents  that we will be able to identify safe and tolerable doses that result in clinical benefit  as measured by clearance of virus and durability of that clearance 
although we are currently conducting a phase ii study in which ana is being dosed for weeks with current standard of care  it is presently unknown what duration of dosing of ana will be most appropriate when used as a component of combination therapy  and further studies of longer duration may need to be explored 
in addition  although we have presented in vitro data showing that combinations of ana with current standard of care and with certain direct antiviral agents appear to be synergistic  these results may not be replicated in clinical trials 
also  it is possible that ana will not be additive or synergistic with other potential components of future treatment regimens 
furthermore  it is possible that tolerability will be worse over longer durations of treatment than was seen for the same dose at a shorter duration of treatment 
for example  in a day healthy volunteer study conducted in  three of the subjects who received ana discontinued from the study due to the onset of a skin rash characterized as mild to moderate with itching during the study  at comparable dose levels that were well tolerated over three days in patients 
similarly  if the tolerability of doses of ana required for long term treatment as part of future combinations is unacceptable or unfavorable relative to competitive product candidates  then the prospects for developing ana as a treatment for chronic hepatitis c will be diminished  causing our stock price to decrease significantly 
the fda could impose additional requirements on the development of ana which could result in unexpected cost increases and or delays to our development timelines 
the development of ana in the united states is subject to ongoing regulation by the fda 
there is no guarantee that the fda will not impose additional requirements on our development program for ana  including requirements associated with patient enrollment  manufacturing processes of our clinical trials materials or other development activities related to ana  which could result in increased costs to us or a delay in our desired timelines 
fast track designation does not guarantee approval  or expedited approval  of ana and there is no guarantee that ana will maintain fast track designation 
in december  we announced that the fda granted fast track designation to ana for the treatment of chronic hcv infection 
under the fda modernization act of  fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions 
compounds selected must demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for such a condition 
mechanisms intended to facilitate development include opportunities for frequent dialogue with fda reviewers and for timely review of submitted protocols 
however  the designation does not guarantee approval or expedited approval of any application for the product 
furthermore  the fda may revoke fast track designation from a product candidate at any time if it determines that the criteria are no longer met 
during we completed a phase i clinical trial of ana for hcv and intend to explore partnership opportunities as a way to potentially continue the development of ana there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain a partnership around ana or that the development of the program will be continued 
during we completed a phase i trial of ana in hcv infected patients 
while we are encouraged by the data obtained to date  particularly at the higher doses at which we were able to confirm a dose response for ana in hcv infected patients  further schedule exploration will likely be advisable before proceeding into larger scale studies 
in connection with the restructuring we implemented in the middle of and our desire to focus our resources on our ana program  we have decided to suspend further development of ana while we look for a partner to potentially fund further development of the program 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain a partnership around ana or that the development of the program will be able to be continued 
if the program is continued  if we or a licensee are unable to achieve viral load reduction at levels comparable to injectable interferon but with a cleaner side effect profile  the prospects for developing ana as a competitive hcv product will be diminished 
furthermore  the phase i clinical trial was conducted in the netherlands and not under a us investigational new drug 
table of contents application  or ind 
if  in the future  we or a licensee want to proceed with the development of ana for hcv in the united states  approval from the fda under a us ind will be required 
there is no assurance that the fda will agree that ana should be tested as an investigational treatment for hcv 
currently  there is no evidence that a tlr agonist can confer long term benefit as a therapy for hcv at an acceptable safety risk  and there is no assurance that the fda will view the data from our phase i study in the netherlands as sufficiently compelling to allow clinical investigation 
if the fda does not view the data from our phase i study in the netherlands as sufficiently compelling  it may not allow studies under a us ind  in which case development and commercialization of ana for hcv in the united states would be precluded 
in we terminated our ana development program due to challenges seen in animal toxicology studies 
to the extent that the ana toxicology observations are mechanism related  our ana programs for cancer and hepatitis c and ability to out license this product candidate could be negatively impacted  causing our stock price to decline 
ana is an oral prodrug of isatoribine  a tlr agonist 
in we discontinued the development of ana as a treatment for hcv infection due to intense immune stimulation in animals 
to the extent that any of the ana toxicology observations are mechanism related  rather than compound specific  we  or a potential future collaborator  will need to determine whether the level of immune stimulation induced by tlr agonists can be modulated to achieve a potential therapeutic benefit with an acceptable safety profile 
although results from our ana week animal toxicology study indicated that with every other day dosing of ana  immune stimulation of a magnitude believed to confer therapeutic potential can be achieved without adverse toxicology findings  there is no guarantee that this favorable toxicology profile will persist in future toxicology studies of longer duration  or that we will not see adverse safety findings in humans 
if we are unable to modulate the immunomodulatory effect with a dose and schedule that provides therapeutic benefit without causing unacceptable adverse events  then the future development of ana may not be viable or attractive to a potential licensee  which could materially and adversely affect our business and cause our stock price to decline 
delays in the commencement of clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenues 
our potential drug products will require additional nonclinical testing and extensive clinical trials prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial sales 
previously  we have conducted only early stage clinical trials on our own 
as a result  we have very limited experience conducting clinical trials 
in part because of this limited experience  we cannot be certain that planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time  if at all 
delays in the commencement of clinical testing could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization 
in addition  many of the factors that may cause  or lead to  a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate 
the commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial  reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations and trial sites  manufacturing sufficient quantities or producing drug meeting our quality standards for a product candidate  obtaining approval of an ind application or proposed trial design from the fda  and obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site 
in addition  the commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment  which is a function of many factors  including the size and nature of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease  the number of other products under development competing for the same patients in trials and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial 
delays in the completion of  or the termination of  clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay or prevent us from generating revenues 
once a clinical trial has begun  it may be delayed  suspended or terminated by us  potential future collaborators  the fda  or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors  including 
table of contents ongoing discussions with the fda or other regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials  failure to conduct clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements  lower than anticipated enrollment or retention rate of patients in clinical trials  inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold  lack of adequate funding to continue clinical trials  negative results of clinical trials  negative or potentially problematic results of ongoing and concurrent non clinical toxicology studies  requests by the fda for supplemental information on  or clarification of  the results of clinical trials conducted in other countries  insufficient supply or deficient quality of drug candidates or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials  or serious adverse events or other undesirable drug related side effects experienced by participants 
many of the factors that may lead to a delay  suspension or termination of clinical testing of a current or potential product candidate may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a current or potential product candidate 
if we experience delays in the completion of  or termination of  clinical testing  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed  and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed 
even if we successfully complete clinical trials of ana or any future product candidate  there are no assurances that we will be able to submit  or obtain fda approval of  a new drug application 
there can be no assurance that if our clinical trials of ana or any other potential product candidate are successfully completed  we will be able to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the fda or that any nda we submit will be approved by the fda in a timely manner  if at all 
if we are unable to submit a nda with respect to ana or any future product candidate  or if any nda we submit is not approved by the fda  we will be unable to commercialize that product in the united states 
the fda can and does reject ndas and may require additional clinical trials  even when drug candidates performed well or achieved favorable results in large scale phase iii clinical trials 
if we fail to commercialize ana or any future product candidate  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to attain profitability  and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be damaged  each of which would cause our stock price to decrease 
if we successfully develop products but those products do not achieve and maintain market acceptance  our business will not be profitable 
even if ana or any future product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the fda or other regulatory authorities  the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by physicians  healthcare professionals and third party payors and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy  relative convenience and ease of administration  the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects  availability of alternative treatments  pricing and cost effectiveness  
table of contents effectiveness of our or our collaborators sales and marketing strategy  our ability to obtain sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement  and our ability to establish or maintain an attractive price for ana when used in combination with other agents 
if ana or any future product candidate does not provide additional clinical benefit when included within a treatment regimen  that product likely will not be accepted favorably by the market 
similarly  if ana does not provide additional clinical benefit when included within a treatment regimen  that product will likewise not be accepted favorably by the market 
if any products we or our collaborators may develop do not achieve market acceptance  then we will not generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  even if our products achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products  are more cost effective or render our products obsolete  or complications  such as long term toxicities and viral resistance  arise with respect to use of our products 
we depend on outside parties to conduct our clinical trials  which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or successfully commercializing product candidates 
we engage clinical investigators and medical institutions to enroll patients in planned clinical trials and contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
as a result  we depend on these clinical investigators  medical institutions and contract research organizations to properly perform the studies and trials 
if these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons  our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated 
we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or excessive expenditures 
if there are delays in testing or regulatory approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties  our drug development costs will increase and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain any of these existing relationships  or establish new ones on acceptable terms  if at all 
we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities  and if we fail to develop and maintain supply relationships with future collaborators or other outside manufacturers  we may be unable to develop or commercialize any of our products 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend in part on our ability to manufacture  or arrange for collaborators or other parties to manufacture  our products at a competitive cost  in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for clinical testing and eventual commercialization 
our current manufacturing agreements reflect a much smaller scale than would be required for commercialization 
if we are unable to enter into or maintain commercial scale manufacturing agreements with future collaborators or capable contract manufacturers on acceptable terms the development and commercialization of our products could be delayed  which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and would increase our expenses 
if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market any products we may develop  we may not be able to generate product revenue 
we do not currently have the capabilities for the sales  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
in order to commercialize any products  we would have to build our sales  marketing  distribution  managerial and other non technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
the establishment and development of our own sales force to market any products we may develop in the united states will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch  and we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully develop this capacity 
if we are unable to establish our sales and marketing capability or any other non technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any product we may develop  we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell any products we may develop in the united states 
we will also need to develop a plan to market and sell any products we may develop outside the united states 
if we are unable to establish adequate sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  whether independently or with third parties  we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable 

table of contents if we are unable to retain key management and scientific staff  we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates 
we are a small company and have approximately employees 
our success depends on our continued ability to retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel 
in particular  our programs depend on our ability to retain highly skilled clinical and preclinical personnel in the field of hcv  as well as biologists and chemists 
we may not be able to retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses  particularly in the san diego  california area 
if we are not able to retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience constraints that will impede significantly the achievement of our development objectives 
in addition  all of our employees are at will employees  which means that any employee may quit at any time and we may terminate any employee at any time 
currently we do not have employment agreements with any employees or members of senior management that provide any guarantee of continued employment by us 
we do not currently carry key person insurance covering members of senior management other than steve worland  phd  our president and chief executive officer 
the insurance covering dr 
worland is in the amount of million 
if we lose the services of dr 
worland  or james l 
freddo  md  our senior vice president  drug development and chief medical officer  or other members of our senior management team or key personnel  we may not be able to find suitable replacements  and our business may be harmed as a result 
earthquake or wildfire damage to our facilities could delay our research and development efforts and adversely affect our business 
our headquarters and research and development facilities in san diego  california  are located in a seismic zone  and there is the possibility of an earthquake  which could be disruptive to our operations and result in delays in our research and development efforts 
in addition  san diego has experienced several severe wildfires during the past several years which have destroyed or damaged many businesses and residences in the san diego area 
in the event of an earthquake or a severe wildfire  if our facilities or the equipment in our facilities are significantly damaged or destroyed for any reason  or we are otherwise required to shut down our operations  we may not be able to rebuild or relocate our facility or replace any damaged equipment  or otherwise recommence our business operations  in a timely manner and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our securities available for sale held in the form of marketable securities are subject to market  interest and credit risk that may reduce their value 
a portion of our securities available for sale is invested in marketable securities 
our cash position may be adversely affected by changes in the value of these securities 
in particular  the value of these holdings may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades by rating agencies on the issuers of corporate bonds included in the portfolio and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in value of the investments 
each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio and may adversely affect our cash position 
risks related to our industry because our product candidates and development and collaboration efforts depend on our intellectual property rights  adverse events affecting our intellectual property rights will harm our ability to commercialize products 
our commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our product candidates  proprietary technologies and their uses  as well as successfully defending these patents against third party challenges 
we will only be able to protect our product candidates  proprietary technologies and their uses from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or effectively protected trade secrets cover them 
due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability  validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents  our ability to obtain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
accordingly  rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection for ana or ana or provide sufficient protection to afford us a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 

table of contents even with respect to patents that have issued or will issue  we cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents are  or will be valid  enforceable or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us 
for example we might not have been the first to make  conceive  or reduce to practice the inventions covered by all or any of our pending patent applications and issued patents  we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  our issued or acquired patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products  may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties  our issued patents may not be valid or enforceable  we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in confidence for up to months or longer after their filing 
consequently  we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent  or the first to file patent applications on our product candidates 
in the event that a third party has also filed a us patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent office to determine priority of invention in the united states 
the costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful  resulting in a material adverse effect on our us patent position 
furthermore  we may not have identified all us and foreign patents or published applications that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our drugs or by covering similar technologies that affect our drug market 
in addition  some countries  including many in europe  do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans  and in these countries patent protection may not be available at all to protect our drug candidates 
even if patents issue  we cannot guarantee that the claims of those patents will be valid and enforceable or provide us with any significant protection against competitive products  or otherwise be commercially valuable to us 
we may be particularly affected by this because we expect that ana  if approved  will be marketed in foreign countries with high incidences of hcv infection 
other companies may obtain patents and or regulatory approvals to use the same drugs to treat diseases other than hcv or cancer 
as a result  we may not be able to enforce our patents effectively because we may not be able to prevent healthcare providers from prescribing  administering or using another company s product that contains the same active substance as our products when treating patients infected with hcv or who have cancer 
if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of ana or ana  proprietary technologies and their uses  the competition we face would increase  reducing our potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability 
if we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of others  it will be costly and time consuming  and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our commercial success also depends upon our ability to develop  manufacture  market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates  technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in hcv and cancer 
these could materially affect our ability to develop our drug candidates or sell our products 
because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be currently pending applications  unknown to us  which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates 
table of contents or technologies may infringe 
there also may be existing patents  of which we are not aware  that our product candidates or technologies may inadvertently infringe 
further  there may be issued patents and pending patent applications in fields relevant to our business  of which we may become aware from time to time  that we believe we do not infringe or that we believe are invalid or relate to immaterial portions of our overall drug discovery and development efforts 
we cannot assure you that third parties holding any of these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us for damages or seeking to enjoin our activities 
we also cannot assure you that  in the event of litigation  we will be able to successfully assert any belief we may have as to non infringement  invalidity or immateriality  or that any infringement claims will be resolved in our favor 
there is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally 
any litigation or claims against us  with or without merit  may cause us to incur substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources  divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could result in substantial damages and force us to do one or more of the following if a court decides that we infringe on another party s patent or other intellectual property rights cease selling  incorporating or using any of our product candidates or technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms  it at all  or redesign our processes or technologies so that they do not infringe  which could be costly and time consuming and may not be possible 
if we find during clinical evaluation that our drug candidates for the treatment of hcv or cancer should be used in combination with a product covered by a patent held by another company or institution  and that a labeling instruction is required in product packaging recommending that combination  we could be accused of  or held liable for  inducing infringement of the third party patents covering the product recommended for co administration with our product 
in that case  we may be required to obtain a license from the other company or institution to use the required or desired package labeling  which may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our technologies  we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product candidates 
we may be involved in lawsuits or proceedings to protect or enforce our patent rights  trade secrets or know how  which could be expensive and time consuming 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming 
litigation and interference proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
further  the outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance  including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party 
this is especially true in biotechnology related patent cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree and which may be difficult to comprehend by a judge or jury 
an adverse determination in an interference proceeding or litigation with respect to ana or ana  to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
if required  the necessary licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from commercializing ana or ana  which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of pre trial document and witness discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology  especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners  employees  consultants  outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property  and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements 
in addition  others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information  and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party 
enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the united states may be less willing to protect trade secrets 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
many competitors have significantly more resources and experience  which may harm our commercial opportunity 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change 
we have many potential competitors  including major drug and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  academic institutions  government agencies and private and public research institutions 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  experience and expertise in research and development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  and sales and marketing of approved products 
smaller or early stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical or other companies 
we will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials  and acquiring and in licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business 
if any of our competitors succeed in obtaining approval from the fda or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do or for products that are more effective or less costly than ours  our commercial opportunity could be significantly reduced 
if our competitors develop treatments for hcv or cancer that are approved faster  marketed better or demonstrated to be more effective than ana  ana  or any other products that we may develop  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
we believe that a significant number of drugs are currently under development and may become available in the future for the treatment of hcv and certain cancers 
potential competitors may develop treatments for hcv or certain cancers that are more effective or less costly than our product candidates or that would make our product candidates obsolete or non competitive 
some of these products may use therapeutic approaches that compete directly with ana or ana in addition  less expensive generic forms of currently marketed drugs could lead to additional competition upon patent expiration or invalidations 
ana  a non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor  was selected as a development candidate in june if approved  ana would likely be used in combination with the current standard of care and or other direct antiviral agents such as protease inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors 
any product currently approved or approved in the future for the treatment of hcv infection could decrease or eliminate the commercial opportunity of ana other non nucleoside inhibitors would likely be the most direct competitors for ana to our knowledge  non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor programs are currently under clinical evaluation by pfizer  gilead  merck  abbott  boehringer ingelheim and vertex 
further  a number of companies have non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor research and pre clinical development programs 

table of contents other potential competitors are products currently approved for the treatment of hcv infection peg intron pegylated interferon alpha b  rebetol ribavirin  and intron a interferon alpha b  which are marketed by merck  pegasys pegylated interferon alpha a  copegus ribavirin usp  and roferon a interferon alpha a  which are marketed by roche 
additional compounds in late state clinical trials for hcv include zalbin joulferon albinterferon alfa b  in development by human genome sciences and novartis  telaprevir  in development by vertex pharmaceuticals  janssen pharmaceutica johnson johnson and mitsubishi tanabe pharma  boceprevir  mk and narlaprevir  in development by merck  itmn  in development by intermune and roche  tmc  in development by johnson johnson tibotec and medivir  bi in development by boehringer ingelheim  and rg in development by roche and pharmasset 
ana is also subject to competition in the treatment of hcv from all of the hcv products and compounds in development listed above as potential competitors of ana and most specifically from the products and development candidates that act as an immunomodulator or have an immunomodulatory component  including peg intron pegylated interferon alpha b  rebetol ribavirin  intron a interferonalpha b  pegasys pegylated interferon alpha a  copegus ribavirin usp  and roferon a interferon alpha a  each of which are products currently approved for the treatment of hcv 
imo  a tlr agonist in development by idera  is also being studied in early stage clinical trials in hcv patients 
other agents in development as potential replacements to pegylated interferon alfa include zalbin joulferon albinterferon alfa b  in development by human genome sciences and novartis and locteron  in development by biolex therapeutics  both of which are longer acting versions of interferon alfa 
also  in development as potential improvements to existing interferons are peg interferon lambda  in development by zymogenetics and bristol myers squibb  and omega interferon in development by intarcia therapeutics 
any product currently approved or approved in the future for the treatment of cancer could decrease or eliminate the commercial opportunity of ana in the oncology markets 
programs that most directly compete with the ana oncology program at this time are other tlr agonists under evaluation for oncology indications  imo  in development by idera and merck kgaa and a cancer program in development by dynavax 
if we cannot establish pricing of our product candidates acceptable to the government  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other payors  any product sales will be severely hindered 
the continuing efforts of the government  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect our ability to set a price we believe is fair for any products we or our collaborators may develop  our ability to generate adequate revenues and gross margins  and the availability of capital 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
the trend toward managed health care in the united states  which could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care  control pharmaceutical prices or reduce government insurance programs  may result in lower prices for our product candidates 
while we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals affecting our business will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material and adverse effect on our potential revenues and gross margins 
if we cannot arrange for reimbursement policies favorable to our product candidates  their sales will be severely hindered 
our ability to commercialize ana or any other product candidate successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations establish appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of ana or any other product and related treatments 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services  including treatments for hcv 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states as well as legislative proposals to reform health care  control pharmaceutical prices or reduce government insurance programs  may also result in exclusion of our product candidates from reimbursement programs 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to earn product revenue and generate significant profits and could impact our ability to raise capital 

table of contents product liability claims may damage our reputation and  if insurance proves inadequate  the product liability claims may harm our results of operations 
we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure for claimed injuries related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials  and will face an even greater risk if we or our potential future collaborators sell our product candidates commercially 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we will incur substantial liabilities 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  the inability to establish new collaborations with potential collaborators  substantial costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to patients  and the inability to commercialize our product candidates 
we currently have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials and plan to increase and expand this coverage as we commence larger scale trials 
we also intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for any of our product candidates 
however  insurance coverage is increasingly expensive 
we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise 
any claims relating to our improper handling  storage or disposal of biological  hazardous and radioactive materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals that cause cancer  volatile solvents  including ethylacetate and acetonitrile  radioactive materials and biological materials including plasma from patients infected with hcv or other infectious diseases that have the potential to transmit disease 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or with the conditions attached to our operating licenses  the licenses could be revoked  and we could be subjected to criminal sanctions and substantial liability or required to suspend or modify our operations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources  and our clinical trials could be suspended 
in addition  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures 
despite the implementation of security measures  our internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses  unauthorized access  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication and electrical failures 
any system failure  accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption of our development programs 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information  we may incur liability as a result  our development programs may be adversely affected and the further development of our product candidates may be delayed 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

table of contents risks related to our common stock future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
our current stockholders hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they are able to sell in the public market 
significant portions of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders 
sales by our current stockholders of a substantial number of shares or the expectation that such sale may occur  could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  most of which we cannot control  including changes in the regulatory status of our product candidates  including the status and results of our clinical trials of ana and ana  significant contracts  new technologies  acquisitions  commercial relationships  joint ventures or capital commitments  disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  trade secrets  litigation matters  and our ability to patent or otherwise protect our product candidates and technologies  conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies  of our competitors or of the markets generally  variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  failure to meet or exceed securities analysts or investors expectations of our quarterly financial results  clinical results or our achievement of milestones  sales of large blocks of our common stock  or the expectation that such sales may occur  including sales by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders  additions or departures of key personnel  discussion of our business  products  financial performance  prospects or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities such as chat rooms  regulatory developments in the united states and foreign countries  economic and political factors  including wars  terrorism and political unrest  and technological advances by our competitors 
our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly  resulting in fluctuations in our stock price 
we expect our results of operations to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
the level of our revenues  if any  and results of operations at any given time  will be based primarily on the following factors the status of development of ana  ana and our other product candidates  including results of preclinical studies and clinical trials and changes in regulatory status  
table of contents our execution of collaborative  licensing or other arrangements  including arrangements involving ana  and the timing and accounting treatment of payments we make or receive under these arrangements  whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones under any agreement that we enter into with collaborators and the timely payment by commercial collaborators of any amounts payable to us  variations in the level of expenses related to our product candidates or potential product candidates during any given period  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
these factors  some of which are not within our control  may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
in particular  if our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
our largest stockholders may take actions that are contrary to your interests  including selling their stock 
a small number of our stockholders hold a significant amount of our outstanding stock 
these stockholders may support competing transactions and have interests that are different from yours 
in addition  the average number of shares of our stock that trade each day is generally low 
as a result  sales of a large number of shares of our stock by these large stockholders or other stockholders within a short period of time could adversely affect our stock price 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control  discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
these provisions include dividing our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders  permitting the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval  prohibiting our stockholders from making certain changes to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws except with stockholder approval  and requiring advance notice for raising matters of business or making nominations at stockholders meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for five years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date  and we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to fund the development and growth of our business 
in addition  the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any dividends 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be your sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future

risk factors in this annual report 
overview anadys pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patient care by developing novel medicines for the treatment of hepatitis c 
we believe hepatitis c represents a large and significant unmet medical need 
our objective is to contribute to an improved treatment outcome for patients with this serious disease 
we are currently focusing our efforts on the development of ana  a small molecule  non nucleoside inhibitor of the nsb polymerase for the treatment of hepatitis c 
we are currently conducting a phase ii study of ana in combination with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin  which is the current standard of care soc for the treatment of hepatitis c 
this study is being conducted in patients infected with hepatitis c virus hcv 
on june   we initiated a strategic restructuring to focus our operations on the development of ana  in particular the phase ii study of ana in combination with interferon and ribavirin 
the strategic restructuring resulted in a reduction in our workforce of approximately  with most of the employees having departed by the end of june and several others departing at later dates prior to the end of we incurred a cash charge of approximately million for the year ended december   which is included in operating expenses  for cash severance  benefits and outplacement services in connection with the workforce reduction 
in addition  we incurred a noncash charge of million associated with the modification of stock options for individuals included in the strategic restructuring 
we also have investigated ana  an oral  small molecule inducer of endogenous interferons that acts via the toll like receptor  or tlr  pathway in a phase i trial in hepatitis c 
in we concluded a phase i clinical trial of ana in hcv patients 
we have also investigated ana for the treatment of cancer 
in we elected to stop enrollment of new patients in the ongoing phase i oncology trial to focus our resources on ana we plan for currently enrolled patients to continue to receive ana until disease progression is observed and to conclude the trial once all patients reach this point 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue the development of ana for the treatment of hcv  develop methods for and scale up manufacturing of ana for clinical trials and potential commercialization  commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval  and potentially in license technology and acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are synergistic with our own 

table of contents research and development during and  research and development expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical development of the company s product candidates 
during  research and development expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with the discovery  preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
research and development expenses may include external costs such as fees paid to clinical research organizations  clinical trial investigators  contract research organizations  drug substance and drug product manufacturers and consultants 
research and development expenses may also include internal costs such as compensation  supplies  materials  an allocated portion of facilities costs  an allocated portion of information systems support personnel and depreciation 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we advance our product candidates through clinical development 
the following summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  ana ana ana ana  net of reimbursement discovery stage programs infrastructure  support personnel and other severance related to reduction in force non cash employee and non employee share based compensation total research and development expense effective july   we began allocating costs for ana between our hcv and oncology program 
for the year ended december   ana hcv related costs were million and ana oncology related costs were million 
for the six months ended december   ana hcv related costs were million and ana oncology related costs were million 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for executive  finance  investor relations  business development  human resources and legal personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include insurance costs  professional services and an allocated portion of facilities costs and information systems support personnel 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis and make adjustments to the consolidated financials statements as considered necessary 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies involve the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents drug development costs 
drug development costs include costs associated with the development of our product candidates including non clinical activities  toxicology studies  manufacturing of non clinical and clinical materials and clinical trials 
we review and accrue drug development costs based on work performed 
we estimate work performed utilizing factors such as subject enrollment  estimated timeline for completion of studies and other factors 
these costs and estimates vary based on the type  scope and length of non clinical and clinical studies as well as other factors 
drug development cost accruals are subject to revisions as studies  projects and trials progress to completion 
expense is adjusted for revisions in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
common stock warrant liability 
we account for common stock warrants which may potentially be settled with cash as a liability 
the common stock warrants have been recorded at their fair value at issuance and will continue to be recorded at fair value each subsequent balance sheet date until such time that they are exercised or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions that require this treatment  at which time the warrants will be adjusted to fair value and reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity 
any change in value between reporting periods will be recorded as other income expense at each reporting date 
the fair value of the warrants is estimated using the black scholes pricing model 
share based compensation 
share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by a black scholes pricing model and the portion that is expected to vest is recognized as expense evenly over the requisite service period 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  the expected term of the awards and expected forfeitures 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenue 
during and  we did not recognize any revenue 
we recorded revenue of million for the year ended december  the million decrease from to was primarily attributed to the recognition in of previously deferred revenue upon the termination of our license and co development agreement with novartis 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to million in cost savings associated with our strategic restructuring initiated in june of which  million was due to reduced ana development costs and million of which was due to reduced infrastructure and support personnel costs 
these decreases were partially offset by severance costs of million 
during  we incurred the following external development costs associated with our ana program million associated with our completed phase ib clinical trial in hcv patients  million associated with our completed long term chronic toxicology studies of ana  million associated with our completed day healthy volunteer study and million for our on going phase ii clinical trial in hcv patients 
during  we incurred the following external development costs associated with our ana program million associated with our completed phase i clinical trial for hcv and million associated with our on going phase i clinical trial for oncology 
as we have elected to suspend the development of ana for hcv and oncology  we do not anticipate incurring significant costs related to this program in future periods 
our non cash share based compensation expense associated with share based payments granted to our research and development employees was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  included in our non cash share based compensation expense for the year ended december  is million associated with the modification of stock options for individuals included in our strategic restructuring 
the million decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to cost savings derived from our completed strategic restructuring which included the halting of early stage discovery efforts and the termination of our collaborations with both novartis and lg life sciences 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in development costs for ana and ana in  we incurred development costs associated with our ana program related to our completed phase ia clinical trial in healthy volunteers  our on going phase ib clinical trial in hcv patients  the initiation of long term chronic toxicology studies of ana and the manufacturing of clinical and non clinical materials 
development costs for ana include costs associated with the manufacturing of non clinical and clinical materials  our completed week glp toxicology studies  our then on going phase i clinical trial for hcv and our then on going phase i clinical trial for oncology 
our non cash share based compensation expense associated with share based payments granted to our research and development employees was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our non cash share based compensation expense was primarily associated with the cancellation of outstanding stock options for personnel included in our workforce reduction  as well as a reduction in the weighted average fair value assigned to stock options granted in compared to 
table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily attributable to severance costs of million  which were partially offset by a reduction in allocated facility costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to a smaller facility 
the million decrease from to was primarily the result of cost savings derived from our completed strategic restructuring 
non cash share based compensation expense associated with share based payments granted to our general and administrative employees and non employee directors for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
included in our non cash share based compensation expense for the year ended december  is million associated with the modification of stock options for individuals included in our strategic restructuring 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in our interest income from to was the result of a lower average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balance and lower interest rates during compared to our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  which were invested in interest bearing securities  was million in compared to million in the decrease in our average cash balance from to was driven by our use of cash  cash equivalents and securities to fund our on going operations partially offset by proceeds received from the equity financing during june the million decrease in our interest income from to was the result of a lower average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balance and lower interest rates during compared to our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  which were invested in interest bearing securities  was million in compared to million in the decrease in our average cash balance from to was driven by our use of cash  cash equivalents and securities to fund our on going operations 
common stock warrant liability 
non operating expense associated with the increase in common stock warrant liability was million for the year ended december  this represents the increase in the fair value of the warrants from june  to december  the fair value was calculated using the black scholes pricing model and is remeasured at each reporting period 
potential future increases in our stock price will result in losses being recognized in our statement of operations in future periods 
conversely  potential future declines in our stock price will result in gains being recognized in our statement of operations in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources overview our december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million 
our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities decreased by million from december  to december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale is the result of year to date cash utilization to fund our operations  partially offset by net proceeds of million received from our completed equity financing during june we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
on june   the company sold million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock to institutional investors for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds from this equity financing are being utilized to fund operating activities and to continue to advance ana for the treatment of hcv 
excluding the net proceeds from our equity financing completed during june  we used million in cash to fund operations during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the decease in our operating cash burn can be attributed to the following factors our strategic restructuring  initiated in june  to focus our operations on the development of ana  our decision to suspend the development of ana for hcv and oncology and the relocation of our corporate headquarters to a smaller facility in july we anticipate the strategic restructuring completed in will generate annual cash expense savings of approximately million to million 
we anticipate the relocation of our operations to a smaller building to achieve an annual facility expense reduction of approximately million 

table of contents future cash requirements over time we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase as we continue the advancement of our development programs 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include but are not limited to the following the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our nonclinical development activities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  the costs related to development and manufacture of non clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory and commercialization of drug supply  the success of the commercialization of ana  ana or any other product candidates we may develop  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
investment portfolio as of december   we have million of securities available for sale consisting of money market funds  commercial paper  municipal bonds  us treasury notes  us government sponsored enterprise securities and corporate debt securities with maturities that range from one day to months with an overall average months to maturity of months 
we have the ability to liquidate these marketable securities without restriction or penalty 
as of december   we performed a review of all of the securities in our portfolio with an unrealized loss position  to determine if any other than temporary impairments were required to be recorded 
factors considered in our assessment included but were not limited to the following our ability and intent to hold the security until maturity  the number of months until the security s maturity  the number of quarters that each security was in an unrealized loss position  ratings assigned to each security by independent rating agencies  the magnitude of the unrealized loss compared to the face value of the security and other market conditions 
no other than temporary impairments were identified as of december  related to securities currently in our portfolio 
we also noted that none of the securities as of december  have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than one year 
as of december  we do not own any asset backed securities or auction rate securities 
cash flows from operating activities and investing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands for the years ended december  net cash used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities purchase of securities available for sale proceeds from sale of securities available for sale purchase of property and equipment proceeds from disposal of property and equipment net cash provided by used in investing activities 
table of contents we expect to continue to utilize cash and marketable securities to fund our operating activities as we continue to advance our wholly owned product candidate ana we are not currently party to any development collaborations and therefore cash to fund future operations will most likely have to be obtained from one of the following sources our current investment portfolio  the sale of equity securities  new strategic alliance agreements or other transactions  project financing or debt financing 
cash flows from financing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands for the years ended december  cash provided by financing activities proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan proceeds from equity financing  net of issuance costs net cash provided by financing activities on june   the company sold million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock to institutional investors for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds from this equity financing are being utilized to fund operating activities and to advance ana for the treatment of hcv 
aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than to to contractual obligations total year thereafter operating leases minimum royalty commitment we also enter into agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations that conduct our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these entities based upon the number of subjects enrolled and the length of their participation in the trials 
to date  the majority of our clinical costs have been related to the costs of subjects entering our clinical trials as well as the manufacturing of compounds to be used in our clinical trials 
costs associated with clinical trials will continue to vary as the trials go through their natural phases of enrollment and follow up 
the costs will also be influenced by the pace of the development activities  timing of the development activities and regulatory requirements associated with the conduct of our clinical trials 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the total costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current product development programs 
clinical development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
as we continue our development programs  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our product candidates will be subject to future partnering  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when  or if  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
fair value inputs fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
see notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
we value our marketable securities by using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of securities valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include money market securities 
we do not adjust the quoted price for such securities 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not active  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
table of contents include commercial paper  municipal bonds  us treasury notes  us government sponsored enterprise securities and corporate debt securities 
the price for each security at the measurement date is sourced from an independent pricing vendor 
periodically  management assesses the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers to derive the fair value of these financial instruments 
historically  we have not experienced significant deviation between the prices from the independent pricing vendor and our portfolio managers 
management assesses the inputs of the pricing in order to categorize the financial instruments into the appropriate hierarchy levels 
the fair value of the common stock warrants  which may potentially be settled with cash and are therefore treated as a liability  is estimated using the black scholes pricing model 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
