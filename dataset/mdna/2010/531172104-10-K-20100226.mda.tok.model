table of contents impairment of real estate the company evaluates its real estate investments upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes in operations to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that could affect the recovery of the recorded value 
indicators the company uses to determine whether an impairment evaluation is necessary include the low occupancy level of the property  holding period for the property  strategic decisions regarding future development plans for a property under development and land held for development and other market factors 
if impairment indicators are present the company performs an undiscounted cash flow analysis and compares the net carrying amount of the property to the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flow over the anticipated holding period 
the company assesses the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon estimated capitalization rates  historic operating results and market conditions that may affect the property 
if any real estate investment is considered impaired  the carrying value of the property is written down to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on the discounting of future expected cash flows at a risk adjusted interest rate 
during the years ended december   and the company recognized impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively 
the determination of whether an impairment exists requires the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions about the future cash flows 
the company has evaluated each of its properties and land held for development and has determined that there are no additional impairment charges that need to be recorded at december  intangibles in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb asc  business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of real estate acquired to land  building and improvements and intangibles based on the relative fair value of each component 
the value ascribed to in place leases is based on the rental rates for the existing leases compared to the company s estimate of the fair market lease rates for leases of similar terms and present valuing the difference based on an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
origination values are also assigned to in place leases  and  where appropriate  value is assigned to customer relationships 
origination cost estimates include the costs to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
additionally  the company estimates carrying costs during the expected lease up periods including real estate taxes  other operating expenses and lost rentals at contractual rates 
the company depreciates the amounts allocated to building and improvements over years 
the amounts allocated to the intangible relating to in place leases  which are included in deferred financing and leasing costs or in other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets  are amortized over the remaining term of the related leases 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of the intangible is written off 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment annually in november and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating the carrying value is impaired 
the company performs its analysis for potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired  and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference 
during the year ended december   the company determined that the million related to its acquisition of republic property trust in october was impaired 
the company recognized a million impairment loss in in connection with the write off of this goodwill 
no impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december  or investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company analyzes its investments in joint ventures under fasb asc  consolidation  to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation 
the company does not have any interests in variable interest entities 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence over  but does not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

table of contents management estimated the fair value of its ownership interest in the joint ventures considering the estimated fair value of the real estate assets owned by the joint ventures and the related indebtedness as well as the working capital assets and liabilities of the joint ventures and the terms of the related joint venture agreements 
the company s estimates of fair value of the real estate assets are based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  current market rental rates  changes in market rental rates  operating costs  capitalization rates  holding periods and discount rates 
for these assumptions  the company considered its experience and historical performance in the various markets and data provided by market research organizations 
in assessing whether the impairment is other than temporary the company considers several factors 
the longevity and severity of the impairment are considered as well as the expected time for recovery of value to occur  if ever 
the company developed the budgets for its unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of for certain of the unconsolidated joint ventures  the budgets suggested a continuing situation of weak demand for space and intense competition for tenants leading to another year of stagnant rents 
this continuing and sustained impairment in value as suggested by the budgets and the other assessment considerations described above caused the company to conclude that the decline in value was other than temporary for four of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as of december  before and after the impairment charge are as follows december  before impairment impairment after impairment liberty venture i  lp kings hill unit trust liberty illinois  lp liberty aipo lp silversword properties  ltd

blythe valley jv sarl liberty washington  lp liberty commerz jfk boulevard  lp total determining values in the current market is inherently difficult and is based on the company s assessment of a number of factors which are difficult to predict 
the market may continue to decline and future impairment charges may be needed 
no impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december  or results of operations the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
it compares the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  with the results of operations of the company for the year ended december   and the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  with the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  as a result of the varying level of development  acquisition and disposition activities by the company in  and  the overall operating results of the company during such periods are not directly comparable 
however  certain data  including the same store as defined below results  do lend themselves to direct comparison 
this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  overview the company s average gross investment in operating real estate owned for the year ended december  increased to  million from  million for the year ended december  this increase in operating real estate owned resulted in increases in rental revenue  operating expense reimbursement  rental property operating expenses  real estate taxes and depreciation and amortization expense 

table of contents total operating revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily due to the increase in investment in operating real estate and the increase in operating revenue from the same store group of properties  discussed below 
this increase was also due to an increase in termination fees  which totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  termination fees are fees that the company agrees to accept in consideration for permitting certain tenants to terminate their leases prior to the contractual expiration date

these increases of and  respectively  are primarily due to an increase in occupancy for office properties 
management generally considers the performance of the same store properties to be a useful financial performance measure because the results are directly comparable from period to period
