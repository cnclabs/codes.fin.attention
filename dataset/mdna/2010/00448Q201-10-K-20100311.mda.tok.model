item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative treatments for infectious diseases 
within the anti infective market  we are currently concentrating on the development of antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c and the development of antibacterials for the treatment of resistant bacterial infections 
we are currently focusing our efforts on developing three hcv drug candidates in two distinct classes ach  a protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c currently in phase b clinical testing  ach  a nsa antagonist also for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  which has been developed in collaboration with gilead sciences  inc  or gilead  and is currently in late stage preclinical testing and ach  a high potency protease inhibitor which is currently in late stage preclinical testing 
in addition  we have established a pipeline of certain other product candidates for which we are currently seeking additional appropriate collaborative partners  but to which we are not devoting significant resources at this time 
these product candidates include ach for the treatment of serious bacterial infections and elvucitabine for the treatment of hiv infection 
we believe that there are several business advantages to developing anti infective drugs as compared to developing drugs in other therapeutic areas 
the emergence of drug resistance seen with current antiviral and antibacterial therapy creates a continuing need for new drugs  which we believe provides us with a large and growing business opportunity 
we have devoted and are continuing to devote substantially all of our efforts toward product research and development 
we have incurred losses of million from inception through december  and had an accumulated deficit of million through december  our net losses were million  million and million for years ended december   and  respectively 
we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity securities  including our initial public offering in october and a private placement of our common stock in august  borrowings from debt facilities  and receipts of up front  milestone and cost sharing payments from one of our collaboration partners  gilead 
in july  we entered into a standby equity distribution agreement or seda with ya global master spv ltd 
pursuant to which we may  at our option  periodically sell ya global shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of up to million 
for each share of common stock purchased under the seda  ya global will pay us ninety five percent of the lowest volume weighted average price of the common stock on the nasdaq global market during the five consecutive trading days following our advance notice 
as of december   we have not drawn down any amounts under the seda 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
in february  we issued an additional  shares of common stock in connection with the underwriter s exercises of an over allotment option 
we received net proceeds of million 
we expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we seek to continue clinical testing of ach  finalize the clinical development plan for ach and complete necessary chemistry  manufacturing and control activities in order to file an ind for this compound  complete ind enabling preclinical testing of ach  and identify and progress additional drug candidates 

table of contents we will need substantial additional financing to obtain regulatory approvals  fund operating losses  and  if deemed appropriate  establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition to the normal risks associated with early stage companies  there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete our research and development  obtain adequate patent protection for our technology  obtain necessary government regulatory approval for drug candidates we develop or that any approved drug candidates will be commercially viable 
in addition  we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our drug candidates 
financial operations overview revenue to date  we have not generated revenue from the sale of any drugs 
the majority of our revenue recognized to date has been derived from our collaboration with gilead to develop compounds for use in treating chronic hepatitis c 
during the years ended december   and we recognized   and million  respectively  under this collaboration agreement 
upon initiating our collaboration with gilead  we received a payment of million  which included an equity investment by gilead determined to be worth approximately million 
the remaining million is being accounted for as a nonrefundable up front fee recognized under the proportionate performance model 
revenue under the proportionate performance model is recognized as our effort under the collaboration is incurred 
payments made by us to gilead in connection with this collaboration are being recognized as a reduction of revenue 
when our performance obligation is complete  we will recognize milestone payments  if any  when the corresponding milestone is achieved 
we will recognize royalty payments  if any  upon product sales 
in may  gilead notified us that they do not intend to participate in the clinical development of ach and therefore  we did not recognize any amortization of deferred revenue during the year ended december   as we are currently unable to accurately estimate our total performance obligations under the collaboration 
we will determine if we are able to estimate our remaining total performance obligations when and if a new lead compound under the collaboration is identified 
effective april   each party provides for the costs of their own full time equivalents 
external research costs continue to be shared equally by both parties 
through march   research and development expenses under our collaboration with gilead  including internal full time equivalent costs and external research costs  incurred by both companies prior to proof of concept  were borne equally by both parties 
for the years ended december  and  gilead incurred a greater amount of external costs  therefore  we were the net payor of funds to gilead under this portion of the arrangement 
research and development our research and development expenses reflect costs incurred for our proprietary research and development projects as well as costs for research and development projects conducted as part of collaborative arrangements 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our research and development personnel  costs of services by clinical research organizations  other outsourced research  materials used during research and development activities  facility related costs such as rent and utilities associated with our laboratory and clinical development space and operating supplies 
we expect that research and development expenses will remain substantially unchanged during as we continue clinical testing of ach and continue preclinical and research work for ach 
table of contents we have established our current drug candidate pipeline primarily through our internal discovery capabilities except for elvucitabine  which we in licensed 
through these efforts we have identified and are developing the following drug candidates ach  a protease inhibitor for chronic hepatitis c infection 
we are evaluating ach  a protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  in a phase b clinical trial to assess the compound s safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetic properties and efficacy in healthy volunteers and hcv infected subjects 
ach has demonstrated strong potency  unique pharmacokinetics and a good safety profile in preclinical studies 
in both the phase a segments and the two phase b segments of a recent clinical trial  ach was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated at total daily doses ranging from mg to mg 
further  ach was demonstrated to significantly reduce viral load in hcv patients by log and log at doses of mg twice daily and mg twice daily  respectively 
ach  a nsa antagonist for chronic hepatitis c infection 
we are also evaluating ach for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
in preclinical and clinical studies  nsa antagonists demonstrate potent inhibition of the replication of hcv  the virus that causes hepatitis c  by targeting a non structural  or ns  viral protein called a 
we believe these nsa antagonists may offer several potential advantages compared to currently available treatments  including greater potency  a novel mechanism of action  lack of cross resistance 
we believe these compounds could be used in combination with the current standard of care  or with other therapies in development  to significantly improve treatment outcomes 
since november  we have collaborated with gilead under an exclusive license and collaboration agreement for the research  development and commercialization of compounds operating by this mechanism of action 
in may  gilead indicated that it did not intend to initiate clinical development of ach we believe that the compound should be advanced 
therefore  in september  we entered into an amendment to our license and collaboration agreement with gilead which allows us to continue to develop ach independently  and also provides that gilead and achillion will continue to advance additional compounds operating by the nsa mechanism of action 
we anticipate that we will file an ind for ach near the end of ach  a high potency protease inhibitor for chronic hepatitis c infection 
we are evaluating a third compound for the treatment of chronic hcv infection 
in preclinical studies ach has demonstrated excellent potency in the low pico molar range  as well as good pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in preclinical studies 
the potency and virology profiles of ach demonstrate that it effectively suppresses a broad range of natural variants of the hepatitis c virus  and may be effective in prevention and treatment of emerging resistant variants 
this compound also retains potent activity against all genotypes 
the very high potency of ach was achieved by designing the compound to optimize the way in which it binds with ns protease 
in vitro  ach can be used in combination with other hcv inhibitors  and is synergistic with nsb nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
ach is currently undergoing ind enabling preclinical studies 
ach for drug resistant bacterial infections 
ach is a preclinical candidate with potency against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  or mrsa 
we have completed a pre ind consultation with the fda on the most appropriate clinical development program for ach while the fda provided guidance on an appropriate path toward regulatory approval for topical administration for ach  the division of anti infective and ophthalmology products referred our request for additional guidance on systemic administration of ach to the division of special pathogen and transplant products  or the dsptp 
we have assessed our strategic and development options for ach including pursuing other applications  such as dermatologic and ophthalmic use  use in medical biofilms and use against drug resistant tuberculosis 
at this time  we do not anticipate moving into clinical development of ach and we do not expect to invest significantly in the future development of this compound without a collaboration partner or other external funding source 

table of contents elvucitabine for hiv infection 
elvucitabine is an antiviral being developed for the treatment of hiv infection 
we have evaluated elvucitabine in phase ii clinical trials to further explore its safety and efficacy in hiv infected patients up to weeks of treatment  and the open label extension of one trial remains on going through we recently licensed rights to develop and commercialize elvucitabine in china to gca therapeutics ltd 
we retain development and marketing rights to elvucitabine in other territories  and we are currently seeking other collaboration arrangements for development and commercialization of elvucitabine in south africa and south america 
we do not plan to clinically advance elvucitabine independently 
all costs associated with internal research and development  and research and development services for which we have externally contracted  are expensed as incurred 
the costs of obtaining patents for our candidates are expensed as incurred as indirect costs 
for the years ended in thousands direct external costs ach including ach and related compounds nsa antagonists ach elvucitabine direct internal personnel costs sub total direct costs indirect costs and overhead research and development tax credit total research and development we are currently completing a phase b clinical trial of ach and are completing the open label extension of one phase ii clinical trial for elvucitabine 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our drug candidates 
we are also unable to predict when  if ever  material net cash inflows will commence from any of our compounds 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the potential benefits of our drug candidates over other therapies  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our drug candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug 
table of contents candidate 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
we expect expenses associated with the completion of these programs to be substantial and increase 
we do not believe  however  that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program specific expenses through commercialization 
there exist numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates  including future trial design and various regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for management and administrative personnel  professional fees for legal  accounting and other services  travel costs and facility related costs such as rent  utilities and other general office expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will remain substantially unchanged during critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition  research and development costs  stock based compensation and accrued expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
revenue generating research and development collaborations are often multiple element arrangements  providing for a license as well as research and development services 
such arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  including research and development services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the upfront license payments are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are performed 

table of contents when we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
under the proportionate performance method  periodic revenue related to up front license payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
actual effort is generally determined based upon actual direct labor hours or full time equivalents incurred and include research and development activities performed by internal scientists 
total expected effort is generally based upon the total direct labor hours of full time equivalents fte incorporated into the detailed budget and project plan that is agreed to by both parties to the collaboration 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations 
in the event that a change in estimate occurs  the change will be accounted for using the cumulative catch up method which provides for an adjustment to revenue in the current period 
estimates of our level of effort may change in the future  resulting in a material change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods  including negative revenue in some periods 
generally under collaboration arrangements  payments received during the period of performance may include up front payments  time or performance based milestones and reimbursement of internal and external costs 
the proportion of actual performance to total expected performance is applied to these payments in determining periodic revenue  but will be limited by the aggregate cash received or receivable to date 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts owed to gilead for external costs are treated as contra revenue 
we revised our joint research program with gilead in both the first quarter of and at which time we extended the period over which our remaining obligations under the arrangement would be completed thereby increasing our total estimated efforts under the collaboration 
at this time  we cannot accurately estimate our future obligations under the collaboration as we have not identified a new lead compound 
therefore during the year ended december   we did not recognize any revenue from upfront  milestone and fte fees previously received under the collaboration 
we will determine if we are able to estimate our remaining total performance obligations when and if a new lead compound under the collaboration is identified 
under the license agreement  through march   agreed upon research or development expenses  including internal fte costs and external costs  incurred by both companies during the period up to proof of concept were borne equally by both parties 
effective april   internal fte costs were no longer subject to this cost sharing arrangement 
instead  each party bore its own internal costs  including fte costs 
in september  we and gilead amended our collaboration arrangement so that we may continue to develop ach independently during an interim period  while gilead may join us in developing ach at clinical proof of concept  as defined 
we will bear all costs associated with ach development during the interim period 
if gilead elects to regain rights to ach  gilead will reimburse us 
table of contents for all ach development costs incurred during the interim period  and all original milestone and royalty payments described in the license agreement will again apply to ach gilead is under no obligation to exercise its right with respect to ach if gilead elects not to exercise its right to ach within forty five days after proof of concept  we shall gain all rights to ach and gilead will then have the right to designate a new lead compound 
we continue to be responsible for backup activities  which included preclinical assessment of a limited number of other nsa antagonists 
gilead will otherwise be responsible for all manufacturing  formulation and commercialization activities associated with such compounds  if nominated  including all regulatory filings and clinical trials after proof of concept 
stock based compensation employee stock based awards we apply asc  stock compensation  which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our espp plan based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options 
we primarily grant qualified stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
to the extent that the amount of the aggregate fair market value of qualified stock options that become exercisable for an individual exceeds  during any tax year  those stock options are treated as non qualified stock options 
under the fair value recognition provisions  stock based compensation cost is based on the value of the portion of stock based awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the years ended december   and includes compensation expense for stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   as well as amounts related to the stock based awards granted subsequent to december   based on the fair value on the grant date 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions which determine the fair value of the stock based awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the grant date and recognize compensation costs for only those awards that are expected to vest 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
there is risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may differ from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
total compensation expense recorded in the accompanying statements of operations associated with option grants made to employees for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we recorded no tax benefit related to these options since we currently maintain a full valuation allowance 

table of contents accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
some of our service providers require upfront or milestone payments 
if our estimate of services performed is less than the upfront or milestone payments  the difference is accounted for as a prepaid expense 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with us gaap 
income taxes we use an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted rates and laws to taxable years in which differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
further  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the rate changes 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we apply the provisions of asc  income taxes  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
we do not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of december  we review all tax positions to ensure the tax treatment selected is sustainable based on its technical merits and that the position would be sustained if challenged 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of payments received under existing or future strategic alliances  joint ventures or financings  if any  the progress of our research and development projects  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of proposed products 

table of contents revenues our sources of revenue during the years ended december    and are primarily related to our gilead collaboration 
during the year ended december  we also recognized revenue under a small business innovation research  or sbir  grant 
revenue consisted of the following for the years ended change vs 
vs 
in thousands gilead collaboration revenue grant revenue total revenue through the completion of our performance obligations under the collaboration with gilead  we expect to recognize additional collaboration revenue of approximately million  offset by any payments we are obligated to make to gilead in satisfaction of external costs paid by gilead under our external cost sharing agreement 
it is possible that we will recognize negative revenue in future quarters based upon the timing of our performance under the collaboration  and on the timing and magnitude of external costs borne by gilead 
comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease in revenue in is due to the fact that there was no recognition of revenue related to the non refundable upfront fee  pre proof of concept milestone and fte reimbursement under our collaboration with gilead 
because we are currently unable to estimate our future performance obligations under our collaboration with gilead  we have ceased recognizing revenue related to upfront  milestone and fte payments previously received until we can reasonably estimate our total future performance obligations under the collaboration 
we will determine if we are able to estimate our remaining future performance obligations when and if a new lead candidate under the collaboration is identified 
under the proportionate performance method  periodic revenue related to upfront license and milestone payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
additionally  under the collaboration arrangement  external costs are shared equally by both parties and payments we make to gilead are recognized as a reduction of revenue 
comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease in revenue in is primarily due to a change in estimate of our remaining performance obligations under our collaboration with gilead 
under the proportionate performance method  periodic revenue related to up front license and milestone payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
the most recent project plan agreed upon by the joint research committee resulted in an increase to our total efforts under the collaboration and extended our estimated obligation period under the collaboration to the second half of  resulting in an adjustment to our proportion of completed performance 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a decrease to revenue under the cumulative catch up method to reflect the company s proportionate performance through december  this adjustment reflected our increased remaining performance obligations  which effectively reduced the proportion of our performance obligations that have been completed to date 
this change in estimate caused a non cash reduction in amounts previously recognized as revenue under the collaboration resulting in negative revenue for the fourth quarter of 
table of contents research and development expenses our research and development expenses reflect costs incurred for our proprietary research and development projects as well as costs for research and development projects conducted as part of collaborative arrangements we establish 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our research and development personnel  costs of services by clinical research organizations  other outsourced research  materials used during research and development activities  facility related costs such as rent and utilities associated with our laboratory and clinical development space  operating supplies and other costs associated with our research and development activities

comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily the result of lower personnel due to the implementation of our restructuring plan in july  outsourced research and consulting fees related to elvucitabine  ach and ach in and the payment of an upfront license fee under a collaboration with fob synthesis that was not continued in  partially offset by increased costs associated with the clinical testing of ach in we expect research and development expenses to remain substantially unchanged in as we continue clinical testing of ach and continue preclinical and research work for ach comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to lower outsourced research costs related to phase ii trials for elvucitabine and the completion of preclinical testing of ach in partially offset by increased costs associated with ach preclinical studies and an upfront license fee under a collaboration with fob synthesis which was terminated in april in addition  the state of connecticut provides companies with the opportunity to forego certain research and development tax credit carryforwards in exchange for cash 
the program provides for such exchange of the research and development credits at a rate of of the annual incremental and non incremental research and development credits  as defined 
the  decrease from to is due to the decrease in the incremental portion of the credit resulting from comparable eligible research and development expenditures in and

at the same time  we combined the amounts outstanding under the credit facility with the newly issued notes collectively the credit facility 
the credit facility provided an incremental million to fund our working capital needs  and is secured by substantially all of our tangible assets 
in connection with the credit facility  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share

as a result  we will need to raise additional funds prior to being able to market any drug candidates  to  among other things  obtain regulatory approvals  fund operating losses  and  if deemed appropriate  establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities 
we will seek to raise such additional financing through i public or private equity or debt financings  ii collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or iii through other sources of financing

there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate levels of additional funding or favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate additional research and development programs  obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others on terms unfavorable to us or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently  and or pursue merger or acquisition strategies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we regularly review our investments and monitor the financial markets 
the recent distress in the financial markets has not had a significant impact on our financial position 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  government sponsored bond obligations and government backed corporate debt securities  with the effective duration of the portfolio less than six months and no security with an effective duration in excess of months  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk or changes in credit ratings arising from our investments 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through future equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
