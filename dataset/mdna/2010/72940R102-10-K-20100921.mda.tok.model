item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we develop and intend to commercialize  cell therapy production technologies and products 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  we have not generated any revenues  and we have negative cash flow from operations of  and have accumulated a deficit of  since our inception in may this negative cash flow is mostly attributable to research and development and general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as we intend to conduct expanded development of our products through clinical trials as well as animal pre clinical trials and experiments 
we estimate our operational cash expenses in the next twelve months will be approximately  before deducting any government grants  generally falling in two major categories research and development costs and general and administrative expenses 
research and development net research and development net costs costs less participation by the ocs  for the year ended june  increased by to  from  for the year ended june  this is due to the increase in our r d activity in order to support our phase i clinical trials in germany and in the us  and our preparation for the phase ii clinical trials 
we recruited new employees an increase of in our r d personnel  and built a new research lab in our facilities 
the participation of the ocs has increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june for the next twelve months  we estimate that our cash research and development gross costs before deducting any government grants will be approximately  we intend to spend our research and development funds on continuing research of our plx cells  completing our phase i clinical trials for the pad indication and entering the phase ii clinical trials  upgrading the d bioreactor operations  and developing capabilities for new clinical indications of plx cells 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  decreased by to  from  for the year ended june  the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the decrease in stock based compensation to employees 
for the next twelve months  we estimate that our cash general and administrative expenses will be approximately  these expenses will include management services  public relations and investor relations and additional amounts on office and miscellaneous charges  which consist primarily of charges incurred for purchase of office supplies and other administrative expenses 
these expenses will also include professional fees  which consist primarily of accounting and auditing fees for the year end audit and legal fees for securities advice  directors liability insurance and cost of fundraising 
financial income  net financial expenses decreased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the decrease in the financial expenses is due to a loss from the sale of marketable securities that occurred during the previous fiscal year and due to exchange rate adjustments 
net loss net loss for the year ended june  was  as compared to net loss of  for the year ended june  net loss per share for the year ended june  was  as compared to for the year ended june  the net loss per share decreased as a result of the increase in our weighted average number of shares due to the issuance of additional shares pursuant to equity issuances since july  as discussed further below 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   total current assets were  and total current liabilities were  on june   we had a working capital surplus of  and an accumulated deficit of  we finance our operations and plan to continue doing so with issuances of securities and grants from the ocs 
cash and cash equivalents as of june  amounted to  this is a decrease of  from the  reported as of june  in addition to the cash and cash equivalents  we have a short term bank deposit in the amount of  as of june  cash balances decreased in the year ended june  for the reasons presented below operating activities used cash of  in the year ended june  cash used by operating activities in the year ended june  primarily consisted of payments of salaries to our employees  and payments of fees to our consultants  subcontractors and professional services providers including costs related to our clinical trials  less research and development grants by the ocs 
investing activities used cash of  in the year ended june  the investing activities consisted of investment of  in a short term bank deposit and the purchase of equipment for our r d facilities in the amount of  financing activities generated cash in the amount of  during the year ended june   substantially all of which was attributable to the july and october  and april securities offerings described below 
on july   we announced that the first patient has been enrolled in a phase i clinical trial of our plx pad product 
upon the occurrence of such event  certain investors had an option to purchase additional shares and warrants the option 
accordingly  such certain investors purchased  in july   shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  and warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable for a period of years and six months commencing six months following the issuance 
on october   certain institutional investors purchased  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the price per share of common stock was  and the exercise price of the warrants was 
the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years commencing six months following the issuance thereof 
roth capital partners  llc acted as placement agent  on a reasonable efforts basis  for the offering 
the offering was made pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s the gross proceeds we received from this offering were approximately  total cash costs related to this placement amounted to on april   we closed a private placement pursuant to which we sold to certain investors  shares of unregistered common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and  shares of common stock  at exercise prices per share of the warrants and the warrants  respectively 
the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the common stock and the warrants was  the warrants are exercisable six months following the issuance thereof  for a period of two and a half years and five years thereafter for the warrants and the warrants  respectively 
during fiscal year we received approximately  from the ocs towards our r d expenses 
while most of our capital resources are denominated by us dollars  about half of our expenses are denominated by nis 
due to the increased volatility of the us dollar  we use foreign currency hedging transactions 
we continue to actively utilize currency hedging transactions to manage our exposure 
outlook we do not expect to generate any revenues from sales of products in the next twelve months 
we may generate revenues from sale of licenses to use our technology or products  although we have not sold such licenses in the past 
our products will likely not be ready for sale for at least three years  if at all 
the ocs has supported our activity in the past four years 
our application for a fifth year s grant was submitted in march recently  the ocs approved a grant in an amount of million for participation in r d expenses for the period march to february in august we received  on account of the approved grant 
in addition the european authorities approved a research grant under the european commission s seventh framework program fp in the amount of approximately  for a period of years 
we believe that the funds we have  together with the approved r d grants  will be sufficient for operating until at least the first quarter of calendar year of our independent registered public accounting firm s report relating to our financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  states that there is a substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern 
management believes that we will need to raise additional funds before we have any cash flow from operations 
we are continually looking for sources of funding  including non diluting sources such as the ocs and european fp grants 
we have an effective shelf registration statement which we have used in recent public offerings we made and may continue to use in the future to raise additional funds  subject to certain limitations based on our size 
if we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support our operations  we may need to take measures to reduce our operating costs  or  if such measures will not be sufficient  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
in that event  we may be forced to cease operations and our stockholders could lose their entire investment in the company 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
we believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation originally issued as sfas r 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated income statements 
we recognize compensation expenses for the value of its awards  which have graded vesting based on the accelerated method over the requisite service period of each of the awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are  expected stock price volatility  and the expected option term 
expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date 
the expected life of options granted is calculated using the simplified method  as defined in staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 share based payments  or sab no 
 as the average between the vesting period and the contractual life of the options 
on december  the sec staff issued sab no 
 or sab  which  effective january   amends and replaces sab no 

we currently use the simplified method  as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate 
we adopted sab effective january  and will continue to apply the simplified method until enough historical experience is available to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term for stock option grants 
we have historically not paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to distribute dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield from us treasury zero coupon bonds with an equivalent term 
the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate affects the number of exercisable options 
based on our historical experience  the pre vesting forfeiture rate per grant is for the options and shares granted to employees and for the options and shares granted to directors and officers of our company 
in accordance with asc  restricted shares or restricted shares units are measured at their fair value as if they were vested and issued on the grant date 
all restricted shares and restricted shares units to employees and non employees granted in and were granted for no consideration or for a voluntary reduction in cash compensation  therefore their fair value was equal to the share price at the date of grant 
the fair value of all restricted shares and restricted shares units was determined based on the close trading price of our shares known at the grant date 
we apply asc and asc eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  with respect to options and warrants issued to non employees 
asc requires the use of option valuation models to measure the fair value of the options and warrants at the measurement date 
stock based compensation is considered critical accounting policy due to the significant expenses of options  restricted stock and restricted stock units which were granted to our employees  directors and consultants 
stock based compensation expenses that were recorded in fiscal year amounted to  research and development expenses  net we expect our research and development expense to remain our primary expense in the near future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research and development activities  payments made to consultants and subcontractors such as research organizations  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in research and development  activities relating to the preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
the costs and expenses of our research and development activity are partially funded by grants we have received from the ocs 
the grant is deducted from research and development expenses at the time we are entitled to such grant  on the basis of the cost incurrd 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive grants from the ocs in amounts sufficient for our operations  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements our company has no off balance sheet arrangements
