table of contents we typically license our designware core intellectual property products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications 
fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus  in some cases  royalties 
finally  our global technical services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project 
proprietary rights synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
we have a diversified portfolio of more than  patents issued 
our issued patents have expiration dates through our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products 
our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work 
however  third parties may develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future 
we are not significantly dependent upon any single patent  copyright  trademark or license with respect to our proprietary rights 
in many cases  under our customer agreements and other license agreements  we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights 
as a result  we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights 
for example  we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 
we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it

item a 
risk factors we describe our risk factors below 
our operating results may fluctuate in the future  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 
many factors may cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate  including changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers products and due to constraints in our customers budgets for research and development and eda products and services  
table of contents product competition in the eda industry  which can change rapidly due to consolidation and technological innovation  our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire  failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle  cancellations or changes to levels of license orders or the mix between upfront and time based license revenue  our ability to implement effective cost control measures  delay of one or more orders for a particular period  particularly orders generating upfront revenue  our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers for a large portion of our revenue  changes in or challenges to our revenue recognition model  amendments or renewals of customer contracts which provide discounts or require the deferral of revenue to later periods  delays  increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products  and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries 
these factors  or any other factors or risks discussed herein  could negatively impact our revenue and earnings and cause our stock price to decline 
the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 
the growth of the eda industry as a whole  and our business in particular  is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers 
the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics  and customers concerns about managing costs  have in recent periods led to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general  with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process 
if these trends continue  demand for our products and services could fall and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
additionally  as the eda industry matures  industry consolidation has caused increased levels of competition for a greater share of our customers eda spending 
this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins  which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete  which could hurt our ability to grow our business  develop new products or sell our products 
acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy 
we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years  including the acquisitions of coware  inc  vast systems technology corporation  and virage logic corporation  to increase revenue and expand our product offerings  and we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future 
achieving the potential financial or 
table of contents technological benefits from these transactions is difficult and time consuming  and the integration of these acquisitions poses a number of risks  including potential negative impact on our earnings per share  failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  problems in integrating the acquired products with our products  potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses  increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products  difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees  failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings  assumption of unknown liabilities  including tax and litigation  and the related unanticipated expenses and diversion of resources  potential negative impact on our relationships with customers  distributors and business partners  and negative impact on our earnings resulting from the application of asc  business combinations  which became applicable to us in the first quarter of fiscal if we do not manage these risks  the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
for instance  if we are unable to successfully integrate the products and technology from our recent acquisition of virage logic  we may not be able achieve the anticipated revenue growth from this transaction 
additionally  if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology  we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets  which would harm our operating results 
the continued uncertainty in the global economy  and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular  may harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the recent major global recession  the global economy continues to experience significant uncertainty  stock market volatility  tightened credit markets  concerns about both deflation and inflation  reduced demand for products  lower consumer confidence  reduced capital spending  liquidity concerns and business insolvencies 
these declines  and uncertainty about future economic conditions  could continue to negatively impact our customers businesses  reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business 
the recent global recession adversely affected the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor companies generally remain cautious and focused on their costs  including in their research and development budgets out of which spending on eda products and services occurs 
these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
under our business model  we generally expect more than of our total revenue to be recurring revenue  as a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a three year period 
however  the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions have caused some of our customers to postpone their decision making  decrease their spending and or delay their payments to us 
continued periods of decreased committed average annual revenue  additional customer bankruptcies  or consolidation among our customers  could adversely affect our year over year revenue growth 

table of contents the recent global recession also adversely affected the banking and financial industry 
if the global economy continues to experience uncertainty  our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms could be jeopardized 
furthermore  we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts  provide credit and provide banking transactions and deposit services worldwide 
should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations  it could adversely affect our financial results and our business 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of the global economic downturn or any subsequent recovery  so our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty  and our stock price is at risk of volatile change 
if economic conditions further deteriorate or fail to significantly improve for any extended period of time  or  in particular  if semiconductor industry revenues do not grow  our future revenues and financial results will be adversely affected 
conversely  in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers  the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 
if we do not successfully compete in the eda industry our business and financial condition will be harmed 
we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services  primarily cadence design systems  inc  mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation  inc we also compete with other eda vendors  including frequent new entrants to the marketplace  that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process 
moreover  our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products 
the demand for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors  including demand for our customers products  design starts and our customers budgetary constraints 
in addition  our customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design  which can lead to the consolidation of their eda purchases with one vendor 
we compete principally on the basis of technology  product quality and features including ease of use  license or usage terms  post contract customer support  interoperability among products  and price and payment terms 
specifically  we believe the following competitive factors affect our success our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles  innovate rapidly and efficiently  improve our existing products  and successfully develop or acquire new products  our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance  our ability to enhance the value of our offering through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage  future purchase rights  price discounts and other unique rights  such as multiple tool copies  post contract customer support  and the ability to purchase pools of technology  and our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms which continue to lengthen over time 
if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors  or if we fail to address new competitive forces  our business will be harmed 
consolidation in the eda industry may negatively impact our operating results 
the eda industry in recent years has been subject to increased consolidation 
we expect this trend to continue as companies within the industry attempt to increase or maintain market share by complimenting or expanding product offerings  or as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
industry consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies that are better 
table of contents able to compete as sole source vendors for customers 
this could lead to fewer customers or the loss of one or more major customers  which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 
our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on agreements with customers  employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
additionally  some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited 
our trade secrets may also otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the propriety rights of others 
if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent  copyright or trade secret protection  for any reason  or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions  our business and operating results would be harmed 
in addition  intellectual property litigation is lengthy  expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 
changes in accounting principles or standards  or in the way they are applied  could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations  and could adversely affect our reported operating results 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance 
a change in these principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results 
additionally  proposed accounting standards could have a significant impact on our operational processes  revenues and expenses  and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and make comparability between periods less meaningful 
we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated  which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 
we devote substantial resources to research and development 
new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors  our acquisitions  our entry into new markets  or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate 
if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue  our operating results could decline 
additionally  our research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development 
these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results 

table of contents unfavorable tax law changes  an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business  such as an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense  could result in a material increase in our tax expense 
currently  a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets  including employees  are located outside the united states 
united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non united states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 
on may  and february   the president of the united states and the us treasury department proposed changing certain us tax rules for us corporations doing business outside the united states 
specific legislation has not yet been proposed or enacted  but it is possible that these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our us income tax liability in the future 
on august   the education jobs and medicaid assistance act of pl was enacted  which may limit our ability to use foreign tax credits on transactions we enter into after fiscal our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the irs and state  local and foreign taxing authorities 
we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and  in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
examinations of our federal tax returns for the years and by the irs resulted in significant proposed adjustments which were subsequently settled 
we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates 
certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates 
therefore  any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions  including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments and expiration of  or amendments to  foreign tax rulings could materially increase our effective tax rate 
the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations which may adversely affect our business 
we derive approximately half of our revenue from sales outside the united states  and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states 
in addition  we have expanded our non us operations significantly in the past several years 
this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees  manage multiple  remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states 
our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks  including international economic and political conditions  such as political tensions between countries in which we do business  difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business  ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights  financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  
table of contents inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions  additional taxes and penalties  and other factors beyond our control such as terrorism  civil unrest  war and infectious diseases 
if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
in addition  our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations  including those related to anti corruption  tax  corporate governance  imports and exports  financial and other disclosures  privacy and labor relations 
these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards  making compliance difficult and costly 
if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines  penalties or criminal sanctions  and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries 
although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that our employees  contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations 
any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our operating results are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations can be adversely affected when the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies  as a result of the translation of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the us dollar 
exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations  and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity  we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk 
if foreign currency exchange rates deteriorate our operating results would be adversely affected by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside of the united states 
from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
under our customer agreements and other license agreements  we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights 
as a result  we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights 
we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 
we believe this claim to be without merit and are vigorously defending against it 
however  there can be no assurances that we will prevail 
these types of claims can result in costly and time consuming litigation  require us to enter into royalty arrangements  subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products  invalidate a patent or family of patents  require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products  any one of which could harm our business and operating results 
product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 
software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced  when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies 
product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products  could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or 
table of contents perception of our products 
in addition  allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could  even if untrue  adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us 
any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers  increase our service costs  subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results 
the majority of our revenue backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered 
a significant portion of the revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash from customers 
we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default  declare bankruptcy  or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed 
moreover  existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses 
our customers financial condition  and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations  could be adversely affected by current economic conditions 
if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments  our operating results would be harmed 
we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 
we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder  consumer  competition  and other issues on a global basis 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or  in cases for which injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products 
if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 
we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success 
if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team  our business could be adversely affected 
to be successful  we must also attract and retain key technical  sales and managerial employees  including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions 
there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers  and competition for these individuals is intense 
our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers 
any failure to recruit and retain key technical  sales and managerial employees would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation 
we face pressure from stockholders  who must approve any increases in our equity pool  to limit the use of such equity based compensation and its dilutive effect on stockholders 
in addition  we are required under us gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee share based equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan  which has increased the pressure to limit share based compensation 
these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive share based packages in the future  which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 

table of contents our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self regulated organizations  including the sec  the nasdaq global market  and the financial accounting standards board 
these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress  making compliance more difficult and uncertain 
for example  on july   congress passed the dodd frank wall street reform and protection act 
our efforts to comply with the dodd frank act and other new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 
regardless of how well designed and operated it is  a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could have a material adverse impact on our business 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 
we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications  and technology systems for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake  fire  telecommunications failure  cyber attack  terrorist attack  or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities  our data centers  and certain other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our operating results would be adversely affected

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item and by the risk factors set forth in item a of this annual report 
please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part of this annual report regarding forward looking statements 
business summary synopsys is a world leader in providing technology solutions used to develop electronics and electronic systems 
we supply the eda software that engineers use to design  create prototypes for and test integrated circuits  also known as chips 
we also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits 
our ip products are pre designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves 
to complement these product offerings  we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems 
our customers are generally large semiconductor and electronics manufacturers 
our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs 
while our products are an important part of our customers development process  our customers research and development budget and spending decisions may be impacted by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 
the recent global recession intensified the cost and investment challenges for our customers 
despite the recent global recession  we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years 
we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution  leading technology and strong customer relationships  but also because of our recurring revenue business model 
under this model  a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this recurring revenue over the life of the contract  which averages approximately three years 
recurring revenue generally represents more than of our total revenue 
the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period 
we typically enter each quarter with greater than of our revenue for that particular quarter already committed from our customers  providing for stability and predictability of results 
although our customers in the semiconductor industry generally have experienced revenue growth in  they still remain cautious and focused on their costs  including in their research and development budgets 
in addition  increased spending by our customers with us may not immediately affect our revenue results  due to our revenue business model 
while we are still cautious about the magnitude and sustainability of an economic recovery  our business outlook is positive given our strong financials  diligent expense management  and acquisition strategy 
in fiscal  we completed eight acquisitions for total cash of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
through our acquisitions  we have enhanced our technology and expanded our product portfolio and our total addressable market  especially in ip and system level solutions 
we expect to continue to explore both organic and inorganic growth opportunities  including acquiring companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic  operational and financial performance of our business 
we will also continue to monitor market conditions and may make adjustments to our business in the event that the recent revenue growth experienced by the semiconductor industry is 
table of contents irregular or not sustained 
we believe that the combination of our solid financials  leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us successfully execute our strategies 
fiscal financial performance summary total revenue of  million increased by million or from  million in fiscal due to an increase in upfront license revenue of million  time based revenue of million  and maintenance and service revenue of million 
in general  fluctuations in revenue are primarily due to customer requirements including payment terms and the timing of contract renewals 
we derived approximately and of our total revenue from time based licenses  maintenance and services  and and from upfront revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this reflects our continued adherence to our business model 
our net income increased by million  or  from million to million compared to the same period in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a one time tax benefit of million from an irs settlement recognized in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and net income 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions  judgments and estimates  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations  are revenue recognition  valuation of stock compensation  valuation of intangible assets  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and service revenue and  to a lesser extent  from hardware sales  in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software 
maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees 
hardware revenue consists of field programmable gate array fpga board based products 
with respect to software licenses  we utilize three license types technology subscription licenses tsls are time based licenses for a finite term  and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive  or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
we bundle and do not charge separately for post contract customer support maintenance for the term of the license 

table of contents term licenses are also for a finite term  but do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term 
the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee 
perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional years 
perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually 
for the three software license types  we recognize revenue as follows tsls 
we typically recognize revenue from tsl fees which include bundled maintenance ratably over the term of the license period  or as customer installments become due and payable  whichever is later 
revenue attributable to tsls is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
term licenses 
we recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the license fee and of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
for term licenses in which less than of the license fee and of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment  we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable 
such revenue is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
perpetual licenses 
we recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the license fee and of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
for perpetual licenses in which less than of the license fee and of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment  we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
such revenue is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events  for example  royalty arrangements 
we refer to this revenue as contingent revenue 
contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs 
it is reported as time based revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
these arrangements were not material to our total revenue 
we recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these hardware sales is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations except in the event that a technology subscription license is sold together with the hardware 
in that event  we recognize total revenue ratably over the term of the software license period  or as customer installments become due and payable  whichever is later  and revenue attributable to such hardware sales is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
hardware sales were not material to our total revenue 
we recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable  and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer 
revenue 
table of contents attributable to maintenance  professional services and training is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products  either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification  or customization of the software 
we account for such arrangements per the guidance provided in asc  construction type and production type contracts 
we use the percentage of completion method to account for such transactions as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion  contract revenues and costs 
we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method  we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term  and we recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed or as milestones are met and accepted 
we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of software or services has occurred  the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the full license or service fee is probable 
all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement 
we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement  our customary policy is to have a written contract  signed by both the customer and us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or purchase agreement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software by downloading it to the customer s hardware 
for physical deliveries  the standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point 
we generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders 
however  a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and  as a result  timing of revenue recognition  including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require or more of the license fee and of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year 
if the arrangement includes these terms  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the arrangement does not include these terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and 
table of contents payable 
in the case of a tsl  because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because vsoe for maintenance services does not exist for a tsl  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license  but not in advance of when customers installments become due and payable 
collectability is probable 
we judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for a new customer  or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to us  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review 
we increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer 
if we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received 
valuation of stock compensation stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with asc  stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and risk free interest rates 
we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards 
we determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards 
we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 
valuation of intangible assets we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  contract rights intangibles  customer installed base relationships  trademarks and trade names  covenants not to compete  customer backlog  capitalized software development and other intangibles 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 
table of contents income taxes our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with asc  income taxes 
our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse  and for tax loss and credit carryovers 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october  will ultimately be realized 
however  if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
we apply a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes 
if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed  we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  we would record an additional charge to earnings 
results of operations our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest october in fiscal year  the saturday nearest october was october  our fiscal years are generally week years  although periodically we have one extra week in our fiscal year that occurs in the first quarter 
fiscal  and were week years 
revenue background we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses  maintenance and professional services and to a small extent  hardware products 
under current accounting rules and policies  we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses  services and hardware products at varying times 
in most instances  we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered 
substantially all of our current time based licenses are tsls with an average license term of approximately three years 
revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period normally one year 
revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized upon completion and customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones 
revenues on contracts requiring significant modification or development are accounted for using the percentage 
table of contents of completion method over the period of the development 
revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time when the product is shipped 
our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time based license  upfront license  maintenance and professional service and hardware revenue for the period 
we derive time based license revenue in any quarter largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements 
we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter 
we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year 
we also derive professional service revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters  since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted  not when they are booked 
our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period 
a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods 
for example  a  order for a three year tsl shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter  but  in each of the twelve succeeding quarters 
conversely  perpetual and term licenses with greater than of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg  a  order for a perpetual license generates  in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped  but no future revenue 
additionally  revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than of the license fees is payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 
our customer arrangements are complex  involving hundreds of products and various license rights  and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements 
for example  they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions  support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage  future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost 
no single factor typically drives our customers buying decisions  and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market 
customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes

the fluctuations in revenue for each type of revenue are explained below 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to bookings in prior years including bookings with new products and features obtained through acquisitions leading to increased current period time based license revenue 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  we included contingent revenue as time based revenue

the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and due to an increase in commission expense driven by higher shipments 
furthermore  beginning in fiscal  acquisition related costs such as severance  contract terminations  professional service fees and other directly related costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred as required by new accounting standards 
prior to fiscal  such costs were recorded as purchase consideration 
we allocate certain human resource programs  information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area 
annually  or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction  realignment or acquisition or other factors  management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
none of these investments are held for trading purposes 
our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument

we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
the functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary s local currency  except for our principal irish  hungarian  and swiss subsidiaries  whose functional currencies are the us dollar 
we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including certain assets and liabilities  shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month  future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders  and certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies 
the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below 
the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to months 
a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
to the extent our estimates are correct  gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
for example  if the euro were to depreciate by compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october   the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately million  and we would be required to pay approximately million to the counterparty upon contract maturity 
at the same time  the us dollar value of our euro based expenses would decline  resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 

table of contents net unrealized loss of approximately million and gain of approximately million  net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october  and october   respectively 
if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate  we will not be completely hedged  and we will record a gain or loss  depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties 
further  we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements
