item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for purposes of reviewing this document  segment profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding corporate administrative and general expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  and other non operating income and expense items 
results of operations summary of overall company results consolidated revenue of billion in was essentially level with consolidated revenue of billion 
the revenue for the industrial infrastructure and government segments increased in when compared to the prior year  while revenue decreases occurred in the other three segments 
consolidated revenue in increased to billion compared to billion in while all business segments contributed to the increase in revenue in  the oil gas segment was the primary driver  growing by percent when compared to the prior year 
over the past several years  the company has experienced significant revenue growth  particularly in the oil gas segment  due to higher levels of capital spending by many clients to support an increase in global demand for oil and gas 
however  the global credit crisis and falling oil prices resulted in some project delays and cancellations in as some clients reassessed their capital spending plans 
in addition  the capacity expansion in the north american refining market is nearing an end  further impacting the segment s ability to maintain its recent level of performance 
though the prospect of growth for the industrial infrastructure and government segments remains promising  the weak economy continues to affect the global services segment  with uncertainty over the timing of a broad based recovery 
the power segment continues to be impacted by delays in obtaining air permits for coal fired power plants and the lingering effects of the global credit crisis and recession 
earnings before taxes were billion in both and the segment profit of the oil gas segment increased slightly from  while the performance of both the government and power segments improved significantly 
the segment profit of the industrial infrastructure segment declined when compared to the prior year  primarily because included a pre tax gain from the sale of the company s joint venture interest in the greater gabbard offshore wind farm project greater gabbard project in the united kingdom  partially offset by provisions for a fixed price telecommunications project in the united kingdom  both discussed under industrial infrastructure below 
the performance of the global services segment was negatively impacted by a provision for the non collectability of a client receivable and the continued effects of the recession  discussed further under global services below 
the company reported lower corporate general and administrative expense in when compared to  primarily as a result of overhead reduction efforts and lower compensation related costs  though much of this improvement was offset by a significant decrease in net interest income in due to the impact of lower interest rates 
earnings before taxes for increased percent compared to earnings before taxes of million in  primarily as a result of a percent improvement in the company s segment profit 
all business segments experienced improvements in profitability due to increases in the level of project execution activities in as noted above  the segment profit of the industrial infrastructure segment included a pre tax gain from the sale of the joint venture interest in the greater gabbard project in the united kingdom  partially offset by provisions for a fixed price telecommunications project in the united kingdom 
the segment profit of the government segment also improved compared to the prior year due to the absence of charges associated with the 
table of contents bagram air base in afghanistan which negatively impacted the operating performance of the segment in  as discussed under government below 
the segment profit of the power segment included a provision for an uncollectible retention receivable  discussed under power below 
the improved operating performance of the business segments in was offset somewhat by higher corporate general and administrative expense  including higher compensation related costs and a loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the united kingdom 
earnings before taxes in were also higher when compared to due to lower interest expense that resulted from the deconsolidation of non recourse project finance debt in the fourth quarter of and the reduction of outstanding debt resulting from the conversion of convertible notes in the effective tax rate for was percent  slightly higher than the effective tax rate of percent for the effective tax rate for included favorable benefits resulting from the reversal of certain valuation allowances  statute expirations and tax settlements 
the effective tax rate for was percent and included the impact of the final resolution with the us internal revenue service irs of a tax audit relating to tax years through factors affecting the effective tax rates for are discussed further under corporate  tax and other matters below 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation were per share in  a four percent decrease compared to per share in earnings per share in represented a percent improvement compared to earnings per share of in both the and per share amounts included the impact of positive contributions associated with a higher overall level of project execution activities when compared to earnings per share in also included the negative impact of a provision for the non collectability of an accounts receivable in the global services segment per share 
earnings per share in reflected the positive effect of the sale of the joint venture interest in the greater gabbard project per share and the negative impact of provisions for the fixed price telecommunications project per share  both in the industrial infrastructure segment and discussed above 
earnings per share in included the impact of the million per share settlement with the irs noted previously 
consolidated new awards for were billion  compared to billion in  and billion in the decrease in new award activity in was attributable to the oil gas  global services and power segments  offset somewhat by increased new awards in industrial infrastructure and government 
the increase in new award activity in was primarily attributable to the oil gas and industrial infrastructure segments  partially offset by lower new awards for power 
approximately percent of consolidated new awards for were for projects located outside of the united states 
consolidated backlog was billion as of december   billion as of december  and billion as of december  the decrease in backlog during was primarily due to certain project cancellations and scope reductions  as well as work performed on existing projects outpacing new award activity 
the oil gas segment experienced a sharp decline in backlog  offset somewhat by an increase in industrial infrastructure backlog 
as noted above  the global credit crisis and falling oil prices resulted in cancellations and scope reductions of certain projects in oil gas during  and the capacity expansion in the north american refining market is winding down  further reducing the segment s backlog 
the growth in industrial infrastructure backlog was driven by new award activity in the mining and metals business line 
consolidated backlog grew during primarily due to strong demand for capital investment in oil gas markets and large awards in industrial infrastructure 
as of december   approximately percent of consolidated backlog related to projects located outside of the united states 
for a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment  corporate administrative and general expense and other items  see segment operations and corporate  tax and other matters below 

table of contents discussion of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies 
engineering and construction contracts engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost 
contracts are segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor cost and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract cost and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
pre contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the majority of the company s engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee 
as of december   percent of the company s backlog is cost reimbursable while percent is for guaranteed maximum  lump sum or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages 
in addition  increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects 
the company believes that there may be an increase in the percentage of lump sum projects executed by the company because of the highly competitive market conditions and global recession 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions 
the company recognizes  under asc  certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated 
recognized claims amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable  but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated  cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  revisions to project scope and cost  and deferrals  as appropriate 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties 
the company generally accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis unless the joint venture is fully consolidated under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r asc 
under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting  the company consolidates its 
table of contents proportionate share of venture revenue  cost and segment profit in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the oil gas  industrial infrastructure and government segments 
the company s accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established 
the company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution 
generally  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment 
execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements 
when the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution  the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles 
asc provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary 
in general  a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
asc requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
the company evaluates the applicability of asc to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards  and will reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events 
contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures asc and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts asc 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests 
interim testing of goodwill is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist 
for purposes of impairment testing  goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure 
during  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and determined that none of the goodwill was impaired 
deferred taxes and tax contingencies deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
as of december   the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
the allowance for primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in 
table of contents the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
the company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense 
retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans asc 
as required by asc  the unfunded or overfunded projected benefit obligation is recognized in the company s financial statements 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year  which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required 
if the discount rate were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities would increase by approximately million 
segment operations the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction  maintenance and project management 
the company is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
for more information on the business segments see item business above 
oil gas revenue and segment profit for the oil gas segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue in decreased nearly percent when compared to due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects within the segment near completion 
both revenue and segment profit increased substantially in both and when compared to as a result of growth in project execution activities due to the significant levels of new project awards during through segment profit margin was percent in compared to percent in and percent in segment profit margin in was comparatively higher than in primarily due to the net positive impact of adjustments for certain projects nearing completion  which were primarily due to the approval of change orders and the successful resolution of disputed items 
segment profit margin in was comparatively higher than in for a number of reasons  including the relatively high percentage of work in the engineering phase  which will typically generate higher margins than the construction phase  and improved contributions from other projects of the segment 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  billion in and billion in new awards in included a major canadian oil sands project valued at billion and an expansion to an onshore production facility in russia valued at million 
new awards in included two refinery expansion projects in the united states valued at billion and billion  and a billion polysilicon project in china 
new awards in included refinery expansion projects in spain and the united states 
amounting to billion and billion  respectively 

table of contents backlog for the oil gas segment was billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  and billion as of december  the segment has been a participant in an expanding market that included very large project awards in diverse geographical locations  which were well suited to the company s global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position 
however  the global credit crisis and falling oil prices resulted in some clients reassessing their capital spending plans for and beyond  with others delaying or even canceling projects 
in addition  the large projects awarded as part of the capacity expansion of the north american refining market are nearing completion  and no other major refining projects in this region are anticipated in the near term 
the lower new awards and ending backlog are reflective of these changing market conditions and correspond with a decline in demand for new capacity in oil and gas production and refining  as well as polysilicon 
ending backlog in was also impacted by billion of project cancellations and scope reductions 
the high growth and level of profitability recently experienced by the segment are not expected to be maintained in total assets in the segment were million as of december   billion as of december  and million as of december  the change in total assets from year to year has been primarily due to the changing level of project execution activities over the periods 
industrial infrastructure revenue and segment profit for the industrial infrastructure segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue in increased percent from due to significant growth in the mining and metals and infrastructure business lines 
revenue in improved slightly from on the strength of project execution activities on mining and metals and manufacturing and life sciences projects 
segment profit and segment profit margin for declined compared to primarily because the prior year included a pre tax gain of million from the sale of the company s joint venture interest in the greater gabbard project  offset somewhat by the impact of provisions totaling million related to the london connect project 
segment profit margin in was also negatively impacted as the result of a significant shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering and feasibility studies to lower margin construction activities in the manufacturing and life sciences and mining and metals business lines  the continuation of the downturn in the life sciences market and reduced margins on greater gabbard project execution activities in the infrastructure business line 
in addition  the segment experienced lower margins in as the result of the consolidation of a large mining project joint venture in which the segment reports all of the joint venture s revenue  but only the segment s share of the joint venture s profit 
segment profit and segment profit margin for improved significantly compared to  primarily as the result of improved performance in mining and metals and the aforementioned pre tax gain of the sale of the joint venture interest in the greater gabbard project  offset somewhat by the impact of provisions related to the london connect project  also noted above 
the higher margins for the mining and metals business line in were largely attributable to an increase in the mix of engineering and consulting projects  which typically generate higher margins than projects in the construction phase 
the segment s ability to command more favorable pricing due to its capabilities and project execution performance  along with industry wide resource constraints  also contributed to the higher mining margins in the period was also negatively impacted by provisions totaling million related to a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in california 

table of contents the company was involved in dispute resolution proceedings in connection with the london connect project  a million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows transmission and reception throughout the london underground system 
the project  which is now complete  was subject to significant delays  resulting in additional costs to the company and claims against the client 
as mentioned previously  during  provisions of million were recognized as the result of reassessments of the remaining time and cost to complete the project and the probability of recovery of liquidated damages and certain claims 
in  the company settled the dispute with no material change to segment profit 
as a result of the settlement  the company is no longer reporting claim revenue for the project  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company participated in a joint venture for a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in california 
this joint venture project was adversely impacted by higher costs due to owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth  cost escalation  additional labor and schedule delays 
as noted above  during  provisions of million were recognized by the company due to increases in estimated cost 
as of december   the company has recognized in cost and revenue its million proportionate share of million of cost relating to claims recognized by the joint venture 
total claims related costs incurred  as well as claims submitted to the client by the joint venture  are in excess of the million of recognized cost 
as of december   the client had withheld liquidated damages totaling million from amounts otherwise due the joint venture and had asserted additional claims against the joint venture 
the company believes that the claims against the joint venture are without merit and that amounts withheld will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and has  therefore  not recognized any reduction in project revenue for its million proportionate share of the withheld liquidated damages 
in addition  the client has drawn down million against letters of credit provided by the company and its joint venture partner 
the company believes that the amounts drawn down against the letters of credit will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and  as such  has not reserved for the possible non recovery of the company s million proportionate share 
the project opened to traffic in november and reached construction completion in the second quarter of the company continues to evaluate claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project and continues to incur legal expenses associated with the claims and dispute resolution process 
the company is involved in a dispute in connection with the greater gabbard project  a billion lump sum project to provide engineering  procurement and construction services for the client s offshore wind farm project in the united kingdom 
the dispute relates to specifications for monopiles and transition pieces required under the contract 
by the end of  the company had recorded million of claim revenue related to this issue for costs incurred to date 
substantial additional costs arising from this dispute are expected to be incurred in future quarters 
the company believes the ultimate recovery of incurred and future costs is probable 
the company does not expect to recognize any profit related to this project until the dispute is resolved 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion during  billion during and billion during new awards during were driven by the mining and metals business line  including a billion project in australia and a billion project in canada 
new awards during reflected substantial activity in mining and metals and also included the infrastructure business line s greater gabbard project in the united kingdom 
new awards during were also concentrated in the mining sector and included a billion transportation infrastructure project in virginia 
ending backlog for the segment increased to billion for from billion for and billion for the growth in backlog during is reflective of the significant new award activity for the year and project adjustments of billion 
the project adjustments were primarily due to the positive impact on backlog of a weakening us dollar for projects awarded in other currencies and revisions to project cost  mainly for customer furnished materials and the greater gabbard project 
total assets in the industrial infrastructure segment were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in total assets in was primarily due to contract work in progress associated with recording claim revenue for the greater gabbard project 

table of contents government revenue and segment profit for the government segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue for the government segment in increased by percent compared to  primarily as the result of project execution activities for logistics civil augmentation program logcap iv task orders for the us army in afghanistan  the savannah river site management and operating savannah river project in south carolina and american recovery and reinvestment act arra funded work at savannah river 
the higher revenue in the periods was offset somewhat by reduced volume at the hanford environmental management program hanford project in washington 
revenue in increased slightly compared to revenue in  primarily due to the start up of the savannah river project which offsets reduced contributions from the embassy projects and iraq related work 
other contributors to revenue included support for the public assistance program for the federal emergency management agency  the hanford project and work that began in late in support of logcap iv task orders 
segment profit for the government segment during more than doubled when compared to the performance in the prior year as the result of contributions from logcap iv task orders  the savannah river project  project execution activities associated with arra funding at savannah river and a favorable outcome of million related to requests for equitable adjustment on a fixed price contract at the bagram air base in afghanistan 
the higher segment profit in was offset somewhat by reduced contributions for the hanford project and iraq related work 
segment profit in increased significantly compared to  primarily because segment profit was negatively impacted by provisions totaling million for the bagram air base contract 
as mentioned above  provisions totaling million were recognized for the bagram air base contract in provisions totaling million had also been recorded for the project in these charges related to subcontractor execution issues and liquidated damages due to the resulting delay in project completion 
during  the bagram project was completed and various disputed items and warranty issues were resolved  resulting in the recognition of million of segment profit during the year 
the remaining disputed items and warranty obligations were resolved in and  as indicated previously  million was recognized in segment profit during the company performed work on embassy projects over the last six years for the us department of state under fixed priced contracts 
these projects were adversely impacted by higher costs due to schedule extensions  scope changes causing material deviations from the standard embassy design  increased costs to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor  site conditions at certain locations  subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor 
the last of the embassy projects was completed in  with some warranty items for certain projects still ongoing 
as of december   aggregate costs totaling million relating to claims on two of the embassy projects had been recognized in revenue 
total claims related costs incurred to date  along with claims for equitable adjustment submitted or identified  exceed the amount recorded in claims revenue 
as the first formal step in dispute resolution  all claims have been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements 
the company continues to periodically evaluate its position with respect to these claims 
new awards in the government segment were billion during  compared to billion during and billion during significant new awards for include the annual funding for the savannah river project  the multi year arra funding at savannah river and logcap iv task orders 
the increase in new awards in was driven by the start up of the savannah river 
table of contents project and the first task orders issued to the company under logcap iv 
the savannah river project s transitional work and first full year of operations were included as a new award in the company reports new awards for logcap iv as individual task orders are awarded and funded 
backlog for the segment was billion as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in backlog in over the prior year is primarily due to multi year funding at savannah river related to arra work 
total assets in the government segment were million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in total assets in corresponded to an increase in working capital to support project execution activities  particularly for logcap iv task orders 
global services revenue and segment profit for the global services segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue for the global services segment decreased during compared to the prior year primarily due to declining volumes of capital work and fewer refinery turnarounds and shutdowns 
the segment began to be impacted by the global recession during the fourth quarter of  particularly for natural resource prospects 
the drop in commodity prices and the overall economic environment have caused delays of work originally planned for late and in certain cases  refinery turnaround and shutdown work previously awarded to the operations and maintenance business line has been performed internally by the clients themselves 
all of the business lines of the segment continue to be affected by the weak economy and it remains unclear as to when a broad based recovery will occur 
the increase in revenue when compared to reflected growth across most of the segment s various business lines 
the operations and maintenance business line experienced growth in the majority of its markets during  but its results were unfavorably impacted by delays in refinery turnarounds and hurricanes in the gulf coast region of the united states 
segment profit margin in the global services segment was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
segment profit and segment profit margin were negatively impacted during due to a million provision for the non collectability of a client receivable for a paper mill in the operations and maintenance business line where the company s scope of work was to recommission  start up and operate the facility 
segment profit in also declined compared to due to the impact of the economic and market conditions mentioned previously on the operations and maintenance  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines 
segment profit and segment profit margin increased in from due to the strong business environment that extended across most of global services markets at that time 
operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise global services backlog 
short duration operations and maintenance activities may not contribute to ending backlog 
in addition  the equipment  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards 
new awards in the global services segment were billion during  billion during and billion during the decline in new awards in compared to is indicative of the economic and market conditions discussed above 
new awards for all three years included new work and renewals for key clients 
backlog for the global services segment was billion as of december   billion as of december  and billion as of december  
table of contents although new awards and backlog declined in  the segment retained a high percentage of its existing clients and jobsites  while also increasing the number of new clients 
total assets in the global services segment were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in the segment s total assets in was due to an increase in working capital to support project start ups in the operations and maintenance business line  additional working capital to support ongoing equipment transactions and an expansion of the equipment fleet to support long term agreements 
the decrease in total assets in was due to the reduction in working capital in the equipment  supply chain solutions and operations and maintenance business lines 
power revenue and segment profit for the power segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit power segment revenue in declined percent from  primarily due to the expected reduction in project execution activities on the oak grove coal fired power project in texas for luminant  a unit of energy futures holdings corporation  that is progressing closer to completion 
revenue in increased substantially compared to as the result of higher level of project execution activities for projects awarded in and early  including the oak grove project 
segment profit in increased compared to primarily due to increased activity on several gas turbine projects  increased pre construction services on a nuclear new build project in texas and project completion adjustments for two emissions control programs 
in addition  segment profit in was negatively impacted by a provision for an uncollectible retention receivable of million for the rabigh combined cycle power plant rabigh in saudi arabia 
even with the rabigh provision  segment profit increased in when compared to primarily as a result of higher levels of project execution activities  including the oak grove project 
segment profit margin of percent in is considerably higher than the segment profit margin of percent in primarily due to increased pre construction activities on the nuclear new build project in texas  project completion adjustments in for certain projects that are progressing closer to completion and the negative impact in for the rabigh project provision mentioned above 
segment profit margin in was higher than the percent segment profit margin in as a result of higher levels of project execution activities  including the oak grove project  and higher front end services in the nuclear business line  offset somewhat by the rabigh provision 
the power segment continues to be impacted by delays in obtaining air permits for coal fired power plants due to concerns over carbon emissions 
in addition  power producers have been impacted by the global credit crisis and ensuing recession which reduced demand 
new awards in the power segment are typically large in amount  but occur on an irregular basis 
new awards of million in included the dominion bear garden gas fired plant in virginia and nuclear preconstruction services 
new awards of billion in include a gas fired power plant in texas  expansions to an existing emissions control retrofit program in kentucky and an emissions control retrofit program in texas for luminant 
new awards of billion in included billion for the oak grove award 
backlog for the power segment was billion as of december   billion as of december  and billion as of december  the decline in backlog since is largely due to project execution activities associated with the oak grove project 

table of contents total assets in the power segment decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  and million as of december  due to a reduction in working capital for project execution activities  including the oak grove project that is nearing completion 
corporate  tax and other matters corporate for the three years ended december   and  corporate administrative and general expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to overhead reduction efforts and lower compensation costs  offset somewhat by foreign currency losses and other factors 
the increase in corporate administrative and general expenses in compared to was primarily due to higher compensation related costs and a million loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the united kingdom 
these increases in corporate administrative and general expenses were offset somewhat by foreign currency gains 
corporate administrative and general expense included million of non operating expense in compared to million of non operating expense in  of which million is for the loss on the sale of the building and associated legal entity discussed above  and million of non operating income during net interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decline was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates  offset partially by the cumulative increase in the balance of cash and marketable securities  with some of the latter being noncurrent 
net interest income increased in compared to  primarily due to lower interest expense that resulted from the deconsolidation of non recourse project finance debt in the fourth quarter of and the reduction of outstanding debt resulting from the conversion of convertible notes in tax the effective tax rates on the company s pretax earnings were percent  percent and percent for the years  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for was favorably impacted by increased earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for which taxes are not paid by the company because the consolidated entities are treated as partnerships for tax purposes 
however  the effective tax rate was slightly higher when compared to the prior year primarily because the effective tax rate for was favorably impacted by the reversal of certain valuation allowances of million and statute expirations and tax settlements of million 
the lower effective tax rate in was due to the reduction of income tax expense of million for the year as the result of an irs appeals settlement in connection with the irs examination of the company s income tax returns for the period november  through december  the settlement lowered the effective tax rate for by percentage points

operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in sugar land  texas  the united kingdom and various other u 
s and international locations  equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property 
uncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
the total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the over years column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
the company generally provides funding to its us and us pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations 
in determining the minimum required funding  the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future

as of december   the company had foreign exchange forward contracts of less than two years duration and a total gross notional amount of million 
as of december   the company had commodity swap forward contracts of less than four years duration and a total gross notional amount of million 
our historical gains and losses associated with derivative instruments have been immaterial 
the company s long term debt obligations carry a fixed rate coupon and its exposure to interest rate risk is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations
