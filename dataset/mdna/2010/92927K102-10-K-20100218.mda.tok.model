products and services we develop  manufacture and sell advanced braking  stability  suspension and transmission control systems primarily for commercial vehicles 
our largest selling products are pneumatic anti lock braking systems abs  electronic braking systems ebs  automated manual transmission systems  air disk brakes  and a large variety of conventional mechanical products such as actuators  air compressors and air control valves for heavy and medium sized trucks  trailers and buses 
we also supply advanced electronic suspension controls and vacuum pumps to the car and suv markets in europe  north america and asia 
in addition  we sell replacement parts  diagnostic tools  training and other services to commercial vehicle aftermarket distributors  repair shops  and fleet operators 
wabco is a leader in improving highway safety  with products that help drivers prevent accidents by enhancing vehicle responsiveness and stability 
for example  we offer a stability control system for trucks and buses that constantly monitors the vehicle s motion and dynamic stability 
if the system detects vehicle instability  such as the driver swerving to avoid another vehicle  it responds by applying the brakes at specific wheels  or slowing the vehicle down to minimize the risk of instability or a rollover 
additionally  we have created the commercial vehicle industry s first autonomous emergency braking system  onguardmax  which assists in collision imminent situations with moving or stopped vehicles 
this highly technological system fuses data from video and laser sensors  integrates with braking  the engine  transmission and stability control systems to assist the driver in reducing risks of collision 

table of contents our key product groups and functions are described below 
wabco key product groups system product function actuator converts energy stored in compressed air into mechanical force applied to foundation brake to slow or stop commercial vehicles air compressor and air processing air management system provides compressed  dried air for braking  suspension and other pneumatic systems on trucks  buses and trailers foundation brake transmits braking force to a disc or drum connected to the wheel to slow  stop or hold vehicles anti lock braking system abs prevents wheel locking during braking to ensure steerability and stability conventional braking system mechanical and pneumatic devices for control of braking systems in commercial vehicles electronic braking system ebs electronic controls of braking systems for commercial vehicles electronic and conventional air suspension systems level control of air springs in trucks  buses  trailers and cars transmission automation automates transmission gear shifting for trucks and buses vehicle electronic architecture vea central electronic modules integrating multiple vehicle control functions vehicle electronic stability control esc and roll stability support rss enhances driving stability key markets and trends electronically controlled products and systems are important for the growth of our business 
the market for these products is driven primarily by the growing electronics content of control systems in commercial vehicles 
the electronics content has been increasing steadily with each successive platform introduction  as original equipment manufacturers oems look to improve safety and performance through added functionalities  and meet evolving regulatory safety standards 
overall the trends in commercial vehicle design show a shift in demand towards electronics content 
although the pace varies  this is a trend in all major geographies  and braking systems are part of this broader shift from conventional to advanced electronic systems 
in addition to increasing safety  improving stopping distances  and reducing installation complexity  advanced ebs also allow for new functionality to be introduced into vehicles at a lower price 
the new functionality includes stability control  adaptive cruise control  automated transmission controls  brake performance warning  vehicle diagnostics  driver assistance systems and engine braking speed control 
adaptive cruise control uses sensors to detect proximity to other vehicles and automatically adjusts speed 
automated transmission controls reduce the amount of gear shifting  resulting in less physical effort and training required for drivers  less component wear  fewer parts  better fuel efficiency  and enhanced driver safety and comfort 
a fundamental driver of demand for our products is commercial truck production 
commercial truck production generally follows a multi year cyclical pattern 
while the number of new commercial vehicles built fluctuates each year  we have over the last five years demonstrated the ability to grow in excess of these fluctuations by increasing the amount of content on each vehicle 
due to the unprecedented decline in the commercial vehicle industry in  wabco s european sales to truck and bus t b oem customers were down  which still outperformed western european t b production that declined in during the five year period through 
table of contents  wabco s european sales to t b oem customers  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  outperformed the rate of western european t b production by an average of per year 
year to year change sales to european t b oems at a constant fx rate western european t b production customers we sell our products primarily to four groups of customers around the world truck and bus oems  trailer oems  commercial vehicle aftermarket distributors for replacement parts and services  and major car manufacturers 
our largest customer is daimler  which accounts for approximately of our sales

for the fiscal year ended december   our top customers accounted for approximately of our sales 
the largest group of our customers  representing approximately of sales in  consists of truck and bus oems who are large  increasingly global and few in numbers due to industry consolidation 
as truck and bus oems grow globally  they expect suppliers to grow with them beyond their traditional markets and become reliable partners  especially in the development of new technologies 
wabco has a strong reputation for technological innovation and often collaborates closely with major oem customers to design and develop the technologies used in their products 
our products play an important role in vehicle safety and there are few other suppliers who compete across the breadth of products that we supply 
the second largest group  representing approximately of sales in  consists of the commercial vehicle aftermarket distributor network that provides replacement parts to commercial vehicle operators 
this distributor network is a fragmented and diverse group of customers  covering a broad spectrum from large oe affiliated or owned distributors to small independent local distributors 
the increasing number of commercial trucks in operation world wide that are equipped with our products continuously increases demand for replacement parts and services  thus generating a growing stream of recurring aftermarket sales 
additionally  we continue to develop an array of service offerings such as diagnostics  training and other services to repair shops and fleet operators that will further enhance our presence and growth in the commercial vehicle aftermarket 
the next largest group  representing approximately of sales in  consists of trailer manufacturers 
trailer manufacturers are also a fragmented group of local or regional players with great diversity in business size  focus and operation 
trailer manufacturers are highly dependent on suppliers such as wabco to provide technical expertise and product knowledge 
similar to truck and bus oems  trailer manufacturers rely heavily on our products for important safety functions and superior technology 
the smallest group  representing approximately of sales in  consists of car and suv manufacturers to whom wabco sells electronic air suspension systems and vacuum pumps 
electronic air suspension is a luxury feature with increasing penetration and above market growth 
vacuum pumps are used with diesel and gdi engines and  therefore  enjoy higher than average growth rates associated with increasing diesel and gdi applications in europe and asia 
these customers are typically large  global  sophisticated and demand high product quality and overall service levels 
we address our customers through a global sales force that is organized around key accounts and customer groups and interfaces with product marketing and management to identify opportunities and meet customer needs across its product portfolio

item a 
risk factors any of the following factors could have a material adverse affect on our future operating results as well as other factors included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations information concerning forward looking statements 
risks relating to our business the credit crisis and global recession have negatively impacted our customers and could continue to result in reduced demand for our products  which could therefore continue to have a significant negative impact on our business 
the credit markets have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by significantly reduced availability of credit and increased borrowing costs 
the disruptions in the credit markets and impact of a more prolonged global recession could continue to negatively impact consumer confidence and spending patterns and cause our customers to reduce truck and bus production 
this in turn could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations  our operating cash flows and our financial condition 
we may be unable to pay any significant fine imposed by the european commission  if we are unable to access our principal credit facility or arrange for alternative sources of capital 
as discussed in greater detail in item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition liquidity with regard to european commission fine  and note warranties  guarantees  commitments and contingencies  we are required to indemnify our former parent company  american standard  now trane  and ideal standard international and their respective owners against any fines that may be imposed by the european commission the commission in connection with a multi company 
table of contents investigation commenced in relating to alleged infringement of eu competition rules in the bath and kitchen fixtures market 
the fine imposed by the commission could be material to our operating results and cash flows for the year in which the liability would be recognized or the fine paid 
our principal credit facility contains a number of covenants that require us to maintain certain defined financial metrics associated with our earnings before we can access the funds available under the facility 
if the current global industry conditions continue to significantly negatively impact both our customers and the demand for our products in such a way as to continue to depress our earnings  we may continue to be unable to fully access our credit facility due to an inability to meet these financial covenants 
if we are unable to fully access our principal credit facility  obtain alternative sources of financing  or obtain some payment relief from the commission or a suspension of the payment obligation from the general court formerly the european court of first instance  and the fine exceeds our funding capability  then our financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected 
our sales could decline due to macro economic factors  cyclicality of the industry  regulatory changes and other factors outside of our control 
changes in economic conditions  cyclical downturns in our industry  regulatory changes impacting the purchasing patterns of commercial vehicles  and changes in the local economies of the countries or regions in which we sell our products  such as changes in consumer confidence  increases in interest rates and increases in unemployment  many of which are now occurring as a result of the global recession  are likely to further affect demand for our products  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
demand for new trucks and buses in the markets in which we operate has a significant impact on our sales 
while in the last few years leading up to  heavy truck and bus production had increased in our largest market western europe  this market along with others has been significantly affected by the downturn 
the western european market  which accounted for approximately of our total sales  experienced a decline in adverse economic conditions in our markets  particularly in western europe  has largely contributed to reduced truck and bus production  which has and will continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and the translation of local currency results into us dollars could negatively impact our results of operations 
we conduct business through subsidiaries in many different countries  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations  which are presented in us dollars 
in  approximately of our combined sales occurred outside of the united states 
a significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower cost locations and sold in various countries 
cross border transactions  both with external parties and intercompany relationships  result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects 
accordingly  significant changes in the exchange rates of the euro  us dollar and other applicable currencies could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our operations that could negatively affect our results of operations 
additionally  our results of operations are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into us dollars 
we are subject to general risks associated with our foreign operations 
in addition to the currency exchange risks inherent in operating in many different foreign countries  there are other risks inherent in our international operations 
the risks related to our foreign operations that we more often face in the normal course of business include changes in non us tax law  increases in non us tax rates and the amount of non us earnings relative to total combined earnings could change and impact our combined tax rate  foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  price or exchange controls  or other restrictions  
table of contents general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries  and we may have difficulty complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  some of which may conflict with united states law  and the uncertainty created by this legal environment could limit our ability to effectively enforce our rights in certain markets 
the ability to manage these risks could be difficult and may limit our operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products internationally more difficult  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
if we are unable to obtain component parts or obtain them at reasonable price levels  our ability to maintain existing sales margins may be affected 
we purchase a broad range of materials and components throughout the world in connection with our manufacturing activities 
major items include electronic components and parts containing aluminum  steel  copper  zinc  rubber and plastics 
the cost of components and parts  and the raw materials used therein  represents a significant portion of our total costs 
price increases of the underlying commodities may adversely affect our results of operations 
although we maintain alternative sources for components and parts  our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials 
this risk has increased due to the current global recession  which is impacting our supplier base 
the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components or to do so at reasonable prices could have a temporary adverse effect on our production of certain products or the cost at which we can produce those products 
any change in the supply or price of raw materials could materially adversely affect our future business and results of operations 
if we are not able to maintain good relations with our employees  we could suffer work stoppages that could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
employees located in our sites in europe  asia and south america are subject to collective bargaining  with internal company agreements or external agreements at the region or country level 
these employees right to strike is typically protected by law and union membership is confidential information which does not have to be provided to the employer 
our us facilities are non union 
any disputes with our employee base could result in work stoppages or labor protests  which could disrupt our operations 
any such labor disputes could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
we are dependent on key customers 
we rely on several key customers 
for the fiscal year ending december   sales to our top three customers accounted for approximately daimler  and  respectively  of our sales  and sales to our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our sales 
this includes sales to our owned meritor wabco joint venture in north america 
many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical industries and  as a result  their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays or cancellations 
as a result of dependence on our key customers  we have experienced and could experience in the future a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if any of the following were to occur the loss of any key customer  in whole or in part  a declining market in which customers reduce orders or demand reduced prices  or a strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility  which could affect both their suppliers and customers 
if there are changes in the environmental or other regulations that affect one or more of our current or future products  it could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
we are currently subject to various environmental and other regulations in the us and internationally 
a risk of environmental liability is inherent in our current and former manufacturing activities 
under certain environmental 
table of contents laws  we could be held jointly and severally responsible for the remediation of any hazardous substance contamination at our past and present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites and could also be held liable for damages to natural resources and any consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other environmental damage 
while we have a number of proactive programs underway to minimize the impact of the production and use of our products on the environment and believe that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations  we cannot predict whether there will be changes in the environmental regulations affecting our products 
any changes in the environmental and other regulations which affect our current or future products could have a negative impact on our business if we are unable to adjust our product offering to comply with such regulatory changes 
in addition  it is possible that we will incur increased costs as a result of complying with environmental regulations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to product liability and warranty and recall claims  which may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
while we maintain reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such exposures  large product liability claims  if made  could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs to defend these claims or that we will not experience any product liability losses in the future 
in addition  if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products 
in the past five years  our warranty expense has fluctuated between approximately and of sales on an annual basis 
individual quarters were above or below the annual averages 
the future cost associated with providing product warranties and or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to plan our capacity well in advance of production and our success depends on having available capacity and effectively using it 
we principally compete for new business at the beginning of the development of our customers new products 
our customers new product development generally begins significantly prior to the marketing and production of their new products and our supply of our products generally lasts for the life of our customers products 
nevertheless  our customers may move business to other suppliers or request price reductions during the life cycle of a product 
the long development and sales cycle of our new products  combined with the specialized nature of many of our facilities and the resulting difficulty in shifting work from one facility to another  could result in variances in capacity utilization 
in order to meet our customers requirements  we may be required to supply our customers regardless of cost and consequently we may suffer an adverse impact on our operating profit margins and results of operations 
we must continue to make technological advances  or we may not be able to successfully compete in our industry 
we operate in an industry in which technological advancements are necessary to remain competitive 
accordingly  we devote substantial resources to improve already technologically complex products and to remain a leader in technological innovation 
however  if we fail to continue to make technological improvements or our competitors develop technologically superior products  it could have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

table of contents risks relating to the separation we have agreed to indemnify trane for taxes and related losses resulting from certain actions that may cause the distribution to fail to qualify as a tax free transaction 
trane has received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that the distribution qualifies as tax free for us federal income tax purposes under section of the internal revenue code the code 
in addition  trane has received an opinion of skadden  arps  slate  meagher flom llp  tax counsel to trane  substantially to the effect that the distribution will qualify as tax free to trane  us and our shareholders under section and related provisions of the code 
the ruling and opinion were based on  among other things  certain assumptions as well as on the accuracy of certain factual representations and statements made by trane and the company 
in rendering its ruling  the irs also relied on certain covenants that the company and trane entered into  including the adherence to certain restrictions on trane s and the company s future actions 
notwithstanding receipt by trane of the private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel  the irs could assert that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction 
if the distribution fails to qualify for tax free treatment  then trane would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of i the fair market value of our common stock distributed to the trane shareholders over ii trane s tax basis in such common stock 
under the terms of the tax sharing agreement  in the event the distribution were to fail to qualify as a tax free reorganization and such failure was not the result of actions taken after the distribution by trane or any of its subsidiaries or shareholders  we would be responsible for all taxes imposed on trane as a result thereof 
in addition  each trane shareholder who received our common stock in the distribution generally would be treated as having received a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received including any fractional share sold on behalf of the shareholder  which would be taxable as a dividend to the extent of the shareholder s ratable share of trane s current and accumulated earnings and profits as increased to reflect any current income including any gain recognized by trane on the taxable distribution 
the balance  if any  of the distribution would be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the trane shareholder s tax basis in its trane stock  with any remaining amount being taxed as capital gain 
our obligation to indemnify trane under the tax sharing agreement if the distribution fails to qualify for tax free treatment could be substantial if triggered  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are responsible for certain of trane s contingent and other corporate liabilities 
under the indemnification and cooperation agreement  the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement  our wholly owned subsidiary wabco europe bvba has assumed and is responsible for certain contingent liabilities related to trane s business including certain associated costs and expenses  whether arising prior to  at or after the distribution and will indemnify trane for these liabilities 
among the contingent liabilities against which we will indemnify trane and the other indemnitees  are liabilities associated with an investigation into alleged infringement of european union competition regulations  certain non us tax liabilities and certain non us and non us environmental liabilities associated with certain trane entities 
we will indemnify trane  ideal standard international  including certain former european subsidiaries and affiliates of the former american standard group  and their respective owners against any fines associated with an investigation into alleged infringement of european union competition regulations 
as part of a multi company investigation  american standard and certain of its european subsidiaries engaged in the bath and kitchen business have been charged by the european commission for alleged infringements of european union competition rules relating to the distribution of bathroom fixtures and fittings in a number of european countries 
pursuant to the indemnification and cooperation agreement  wabco europe bvba an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wabco will be responsible for  and will indemnify american standard now trane and ideal standard international including certain subsidiaries engaged  or formerly engaged in the bath and kitchen business and their respective affiliates against any fines related to this investigation 
see item legal proceedings for additional discussion of the procedural history  response  hearing and appeals process related to the european commission investigation 

table of contents risks relating to our common stock your percentage ownership in wabco may be diluted in the future 
your percentage ownership in wabco may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that have already been granted and that we expect will be granted to our directors and officers in the future 
prior to the separation and record date for the distribution  trane approved an omnibus incentive plan  which provides for the grant of equity based awards  including restricted stock  restricted stock units  stock options  stock appreciation rights  phantom equity awards and other equity based awards to our directors  officers and other employees 
after the separation and record date for the distribution  wabco has approved its own omnibus incentive plan 
in the future  we may issue additional equity securities  subject to limitations imposed by the tax sharing agreement  in order to fund working capital needs  capital expenditures and product development  or to make acquisitions and other investments  which may dilute your ownership interest 
we cannot assure you that we will pay any dividends or repurchase shares 
while we have historically returned value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends  our ability to repurchase shares and pay dividends is limited by available cash  contingent liabilities  such as any fine resulting from the alleged infringement discussed above and surplus 
moreover  all decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends and share repurchases will be at the sole discretion of our board and will be evaluated from time to time in light of our financial condition  earnings  capital requirements of our business  covenants associated with certain debt obligations  legal requirements  regulatory constraints  industry practice and other factors that our board deems relevant 
our shareholder rights plan and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated by laws and delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
these provisions include  among others a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms  elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent  rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings  the right of our board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
on july   our board adopted a shareholder rights plan  which provides  among other things  that when specified events occur  our shareholders will be entitled to purchase from us a newly created series of junior preferred stock 
the preferred stock purchase rights are triggered by the earlier to occur of i ten business days or a later date determined by our board of directors before the rights are separated from our common stock after the public announcement that a person or group has become an acquiring person by acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common stock or ii ten business days or a later date determined by our board before the rights are separated from our common stock after a person or group begins a tender or exchange offer that  if completed  would result in that person or group becoming an acquiring person 
the issuance of preferred stock pursuant to the shareholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any 
table of contents acquisition proposal 
these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 
however  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders

the european commission investigation in november  certain of american standard s european subsidiaries were contacted by the european commission as part of a multi company investigation into possible infringement of european union competition regulations relating to the distribution of bathroom fixtures and fittings in certain european countries 
in november  the european commission sent certain of american standard s european subsidiaries a written request for information 
on march   american standard and certain of its european subsidiaries engaged in the bath and kitchen business received an administrative complaint entitled a statement of objections from the european 
table of contents commission alleging infringements of european union competition rules by numerous bathroom fixture and fittings companies 
as a result of a legal reorganization that occurred in  wabco europe bvba an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wabco  formerly american standard europe bvba  is responsible for  and is liable to indemnify trane and ideal standard international representing the successor to the bath and kitchen business  and owner of certain of the former american standard subsidiaries and their owners against any fines related to this investigation 
american standard and its charged european subsidiaries responded to the statement of objections on july  wabco europe bvba attended a hearing with the european commission to present evidence regarding the response to the statement of objections in november since that time  the commission has made several requests for additional information from wabco relating to  among other things  historic sales for all of the charged entities for periods prior to and subsequent to the spin off and the sale of the bath kitchen division of trane 
a fine would be required to be paid within three months of any decision  unless imposition of any such fine were appealed within two months of the decision 
if we elected to appeal  we would be required to pay the fine or to provide a bank guarantee for the full amount of the fine plus interest 
the appeals process could take as long as five to seven years during which time wabco would not have access to such funds or would be required to provide a bank guarantee 
the commission or the general court previously known as the court of first instance could agree to waive or suspend this requirement for reasons of financial hardship  however this outcome cannot be assured and will depend on the relevant facts at the time

executive overview our results reflect the continued severity of the global economic recession 
market conditions quickly deteriorated across most industries and regions 
turmoil in the financial markets in and intensified the recession and was a contributing factor in most industrial companies decisions to slow production  reduce spending 
table of contents and conserve cash 
this was evident in the commercial vehicle industry  especially in our most important market  western europe  where truck and bus production declined in we acted decisively in response to the global commercial vehicle industry slowdown to align our capacity and cost structure for a significantly reduced level of market demand 
we also continued to focus our efforts on expanding our business in emerging markets of china and india 
while commercial vehicle production in europe and north america declined in  china s commercial vehicle production grew in we currently maintain two joint ventures in china and a market leading majority owned subsidiary in india to supply the growing local markets and to manufacture products for export 
in addition to serving the local asian market  our indian subsidiary  wabco tvs  also acts as a sourcing hub for our global operations by purchasing raw materials from the lower cost asian region and leveraging the machining capabilities in our factory in mahindra city to process the metals  castings and electrical motors that are used in our other factories in europe  north america and china to manufacture our products 
india is also a center of mechanical engineering activity  and we continue to develop our relationships in the local engineering community to benefit our own research and development efforts 
although many of our major markets experienced significant declines in  the first half of the year was impacted more severely as the third and fourth quarters began to show signs of incremental improvement 
during  we continued to drive improvements through our wabco operating system  one of our industry s most advanced management environments 
despite market turmoil that continued to strongly impact our suppliers and our own significant internal streamlining activities  our wabco operating system delivered million of materials and conversion productivity  with materials productivity representing a record of total materials cost 
among other strong positive results  we also achieved cost savings of million in operating expenses  representing a reduction of approximately year on year 
our markets and our customers our sales are affected by changes in truck and bus t b production  especially in europe 
europe is our largest geographic market and sales to t b oems represent our largest customer group 
the table below shows the relationship between our european sales to t b oems  which  account for approximately of our global sales to t b oems and western european t b production  for the last five years 
sales data is shown at a constant euro to us dollar exchange rate for year to year comparability and to make comparisons to unit production meaningful 
over the past five years  our sales have outperformed the growth in western european t b production by an average of three percent per year 
year to year change sales to european t b oems at constant fx rate western european t b production in general  our sales track directionally with truck and bus builds 
however  individual year to year sales changes are also influenced by other factors such as timing of orders and deliveries to t b oem customers  application content  new product introduction  price and introduction of new customer platforms 
the level of truck build activity is influenced by general economic conditions  including interest rate levels and inflation 
in regions outside europe  there is less correlation between our sales and regional truck and bus builds 
this is because of our smaller presence which magnifies changes in content on individual truck platforms as well as less stringent safety regulations 
in addition  commercial vehicles built in the emerging countries are for both domestic and export markets  which will require varying types of components depending on the requirements of each respective market 
as other regions adopt additional safety regulations in the future  similar to or approaching europe s  we expect the resulting increase in content will bring higher correlation between our regional sales and changes in regional truck and bus production 
our aftermarket sales account for approximately of total sales and are affected by a variety of factors content on specific vehicles and breadth of our product range  number of commercial trucks in active operation  truck age  miles driven  demand for transported goods and overall economic activity 
on average  our aftermarket sales on a constant exchange to the us dollar rate have grown by annually for the last five years as shown in the table below 
year to year change average change aftermarket sales at constant fx rate

for the fiscal year ended december   our top customers accounted for approximately of our sales 
results of operations approximately of our sales are outside the us and therefore  changes in exchange rates can have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations  which are presented in us dollars 
year over year changes in sales  expenses and net income for compared with and compared with  are presented both with and without the effects of foreign currency translation 
changes in sales  expenses and net income excluding foreign exchange effects are calculated using current year sales  expenses and net income translated at prior year exchange rates 
presenting changes in sales  expenses and net income excluding the effects of foreign currency translation is not in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  but we analyze this data because it is useful to us in understanding the operating performance of our business 
we believe this data is also useful to shareholders for the same reason 
the changes in sales  expenses and net income excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation are not meant to be a substitute for measurements prepared in conformity with us gaap  nor to be considered in isolation 
management believes that presenting these non us gaap financial measures is useful to shareholders because it enhances their understanding of how management assesses the operating performance of the company s business

in addition to the deterioration in the end market demand  inventory reductions across most commercial vehicle manufacturers contributed to the production decline 
the first half of experienced the most significant decline versus  which was a decrease of excluding foreign currency translation effects 
however  the trend in our sales as we finished included an improvement of in the third quarter versus the second quarter  excluding the impact of consolidating wabco tvs into total wabco and the impact from foreign currency translation effects  and an improvement in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter of  excluding foreign currency translation effects 
sales in europe  our largest market  decreased approximately excluding foreign currency translation effects for the full year  which based on our estimate  was better than the decline in european truck production 
sales decreased in north america  which based on our estimate  was less than the decrease in north american truck production 
sales in asia increased excluding foreign currency translation effects  which included a favorable impact of resulting from the acquisition of wabco tvs in india 
the sales growth in asia included an increase in china sales of excluding foreign currency translation effects  which benefitted from a higher production of trucks for the domestic markets 
however  sales growth in china was less than the increase in production of new commercial vehicles due to the significant decline in trucks produced for export which carry a higher content per vehicle than trucks for the domestic market 
sales in south america decreased excluding foreign currency translation effects 
total aftermarket sales decline  included in the geographic numbers provided above  was excluding foreign currency translation effects  which was impacted by both the original equipment supply channel and the independent aftermarket channel due to declines in transportation 
the uncertainty of the development of the global economy makes it difficult to predict how demand for commercial vehicles will further develop in however  the reduction of new truck inventory by the oem s experienced in is expected to benefit the company as production levels will need to increase to meet the level of end market demand of new trucks 

table of contents gross profit gross profit decreased by million million excluding foreign currency translation effects 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by volume and mix decreases of approximately million

if necessary  we may also seek to obtain a waiver or renegotiate the debt covenants on our primary credit facility 
if the commission were to issue a fine in excess of our funding capability  we intend to seek approval from the commission for alternative payment measures  such as installment payments or an extension of the payment obligation  which we are advised is available in cases of extreme hardship and substantiated financial difficulties 
it is our understanding that it is not in the commission s interest  nor is it their intention  to force companies out of business due to fine payments  and we believe that the commission will be sensitive to the current economic conditions 
however  this outcome cannot be assured due to the degree of discretion inherent in the commission s fining and enforcement powers 
the current economic conditions require us to observe that if the fine were to be issued in an amount in excess of our funding capability  and various mitigating actions which the company has implemented and is planning were to fail  the fine could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and liquidity of wabco

the fair value hedge was highly effective and therefore any volatility resulting from translating the hedged debt into us dollars and the remeasurement of the swap did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
the company did not renew this cross currency swap  given its decision not to renew the day million credit facility previously entered into with rabobank

in particular  this statement sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity shall evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the company has adopted certain provisions of asc as of june  as asc relates specifically to disclosures  the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued guidance primarily contained in asc topic  transfers and servicing 
the updated guidance improves the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
asc is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after november  earlier application is prohibited 
futhermore  the company considered its pending adoption of asc upon entering into the new accounts receivable financing facility which is further discussed in note accounts receivable financing facility 
in june  the fasb issued guidance primarily contained in asc topic  consolidation 
the updated guidance requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity

the company believes that the adoption of certain provisions of asc will not have a material impact on its future consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu  measuring liabilities at fair value 
asu amends asc  fair value measurements  by clarifying that when a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  an entity must measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques i the use of a quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset  ii the use of quoted prices for a similar liability or similar liabilities when traded as an asset  and iii an income approach such as a present value technique  or a market approach but which should  in all instances  maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the company adopted amendments to the codification resulting from asu on september  the adoption of certain provisions of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
those judgments and estimates have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements because they result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we frequently re evaluate our judgments and estimates that are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the ones that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty  judgment and complexity are stock based compensation  post retirement benefits  warranties  streamlining expenses  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts and commitments and contingencies 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts wabco analyzes the aging of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
inventories inventory costs are determined by the use of the last in  first out lifo method  and are stated at the lower of such cost or realizable value 
the lifo method is used as it provides a better matching of the costs to the sales 
on a quarterly basis  the company tests its inventory for slow moving and obsolete stock by considering both the historical and expected sales and the company will record a provision  if needed 
facilities property  plant and equipment balances are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
wabco capitalizes costs  including interest during construction of fixed asset additions  improvements  and betterments that add to productive capacity or extend the asset life 
wabco assesses facilities for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
goodwill the company has a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet that is not amortized  but subject to impairment tests each fiscal year on october st or more often when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the company s impairment tests utilize the two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognize in an amount equal to that excess 

table of contents the recoverability of goodwill is measured based on one reporting unit for the total company 
wabco s plants  engineering  technical support  distribution centers and other support functions are shared among various product families and serve all distribution channels with many customers 
based on the organizational structure  as well as the nature of financial information available and reviewed by the company s chief operating decision maker to assess performance and make decisions about resource allocations  the company has concluded that its total wabco operations represent one reportable segment and that wabco s performance and future net cash flow perspectives are best understood and assessed as such 
in order to approximate the fair value of the reporting unit for purposes of testing recoverability  we use the total market capitalization of the company  a market approach  which is then compared to the total book value of the company 
in the event the company s fair value has fallen below book value  the company will compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill  the company will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income 
there has been no impairment of goodwill during and the company s goodwill was not at risk for failing the first step of its impairment test 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes in its combined statement of income the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock grants based on estimated fair values 
the company utilizes the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for each option award 
there are several assumptions that must be made when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends to be paid and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
the company has reviewed each of these assumptions carefully and based on the analysis discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements determined its best estimate for these variables 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of wabco s common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and expected performance of wabco s stock 
an increase in the volatility of wabco s stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards 
an increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense 
dividend yields and risk free interest rates are less difficult to estimate  but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  merit and promotion increases and the health care cost trend rate 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and health care costs  in making its assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the assumptions as to the expected long term rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets  historical long term rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions 
the discount rate used for us plans reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income investments on the company s annual measurement date december and is subject to change each year 
the discount rate was determined by matching  on an approximate basis  the coupons and maturities for a portfolio of corporate bonds rated aa or better by moody s investor services to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the projected benefit obligation 
the discount rates used for plans outside the us are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities  the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment 
a decrease of one percentage point in the assumed rate of return on plan assets and a decrease of one percentage point in the discount rate applied to projected benefit obligations would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
an increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate in each future year would increase annual health insurance costs by approximately million 
see the disclosures about pension and post retirement obligations  the composition of plan assets  assumptions and other matters in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
warranties estimated product warranty expenses are accrued in cost of good sold at the time the related sales are recognized 
estimates of warranty expenses are based primarily on warranty claims experience and specific customer contracts 
warranty expenses include accruals for basic warranties for product sold  as well as accruals for product recalls  service campaigns and other related events when they are known and estimable 
to the extent we experience changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual is adjusted accordingly 
warranty accrual estimates are updated based upon the most current 
table of contents warranty claims information available 
such changes in estimates  including foreign currency exchange effects decreased increased our warranty accrual by a net of million in  million in and million in the warranty accrual includes foreign currency exchange effects of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a three year summary of warranty costs 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance of million related to foreign net operating losses 
we also estimate our effective income tax rate periodically  considering all known factors and the estimated effects of future events or tax planning strategies that can cause that rate to vary from the statutory rate 
estimating the outcome of future events is inherently uncertain and final resolution of those events can cause the effective rate to vary significantly 
in addition  changes in us or foreign tax laws or rulings may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
a tax position is a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions shall be recognized only when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position will be sustained 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold should be measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
whether the more likely than not recognition threshold is met for a tax position  is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 
the company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to products and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of liability to be recorded  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the liabilities recorded may change in the future  possibly by significant amounts  due to new developments in any of the matters 
as part of a multi company investigation commenced in  the former american standard companies inc now trane inc  and certain of its european subsidiaries engaged in the bath and kitchen business were charged by the european commission for alleged infringements of european union competition rules relating to the distribution of bathroom fixtures and fittings in a number of european countries 
pursuant to the indemnification and cooperation agreement that was concluded in the context of the spin off of wabco from trane inc  wabco europe bvba an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wabco is responsible for  and is liable to indemnify trane inc and ideal standard international representing the successor to the bath and kitchen business  and owner of certain of the former american standard subsidiaries and their owners against  any fines related to this investigation 
we anticipate that this investigation may result in the imposition of a fine in  however  we are unable to reasonably estimate the likely amount or range of any fine that may result from this matter for the reasons that follow 
under its fining guidelines  the commission will determine a basic amount of the fine by considering the value of the sales of goods to which the infringement related  the gravity of the infringement and its duration 
in applying the guidelines  the commission retains considerable discretion in calculating the fine  including the determination of the basic amount  the evaluation of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances  the availability of leniency and the assessment of the overall deterrent effect of the fine 
due to the specific circumstances  and the factual differences of and with published precedents so far  there is insufficient guidance to allow us to ascertain how the commission would exercise its discretion in applying the guidelines in the present case 
if the 
table of contents commission were to apply the guidelines to the allegations as set forth in the statement of objections  the fine could be significant depending on whether the breadth of the allegations and the alleged duration of the infringement are maintained 
american standard and its charged european businesses presented defenses to the allegations in the statement of objections  as did wabco europe bvba at an oral hearing with the european commission in november it is not possible to judge the impact of these defenses on the final outcome 
we would be required to pay a fine within three months of the decision  unless we filed an appeal within two months of the decision  in which case we would be required to pay the fine or to provide a bank guarantee for the full amount of the fine plus interest 
the appeals process could take as long as five to seven years during which time wabco would not have access to such funds or would be required to provide a bank guarantee 
the commission or the general court previously known as the court of first instance could agree to waive or suspend this requirement for reasons of financial hardship  however  this outcome cannot be assured and will depend on the relevant facts at the time 
article of council regulation no 
provides for a maximum fine equal to of the parent company s worldwide revenue attributable to all of its products for the fiscal year prior to the year in which the fine is imposed 
it is unknown on what basis the commission will calculate the maximum 
as we have previously reported  if the commission had issued a fine in and based it on american standard s reported worldwide revenue in  the total potential maximum liability would have been approximately billion subject to a probable reduction for leniency of at least 
american standard no longer exists 
the effect  if any  of the spin off of wabco from american standard  the sale of its bath and kitchen business to ideal standard international  and the merger of trane inc with ingersoll rand company limited  all of which occurred in and  on the determination of the applicable cap is unclear 
furthermore  we have argued that the cap should be calculated on the basis of the revenue of the charged european businesses  rather than the parent company s worldwide revenues 
the fine imposed by the commission could be material to wabco s operating results and cash flows for the year in which the liability would be recognized or the fine paid 
we are continuing to fully cooperate with the commission and believe the defenses we have presented to the commission will be considered and taken into account in the determination of the fine 
as of december   the company has a cash balance of million 
the company s million five year revolving credit facility is a non amortizing facility 
there is a balance of million outstanding under our principal credit facility 
our principal credit facility contains covenants which limit our ability to access the funds available under the facility 
due to current economic conditions  the covenant which is most restrictive requires that our total net indebtedness does not exceed three times a trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda ebitda covenant  as defined in the agreement to the five year million credit facility 
as of december   our trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda was million  which consists of million for the fourth quarter  million for the third quarter  million for the second quarter and million for the first quarter 
our net indebtedness was million at december   resulting in an ebitda covenant ratio of to given our total indebtedness including guarantees at december  we had the ability to borrow an incremental million within the covenants of our principal credit facility 
as described in more detail in note  accounts receivable financing facility  on september   the company established a new accounts receivable financing facility with soci t g n rale bank nederland n 
v the receivables facility 
the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold into the receivables facility will be million  however  there can be no assurance that the participating sellers will generate sufficient receivables to access the maximum availability 
the term of the receivables facility is for one year  with the possibility of four additional annual extensions  assuming the company and the participating sellers are in compliance with certain covenants 
as of december   the funding that would have been available under this program  if utilized  was approximately million million at december  exchange rates 
on april   the company entered into a million factoring program in respect to accounts receivable from one of our customers 
as of december   the funding that would have been available under this program  if utilized  was approximately million million at december  exchange rates 
other potential sources of financing that the company is considering include  but are not limited to i other accounts receivable factoring programs  ii sale leaseback of certain property  plant and equipment  iii supply 
table of contents chain financing and iv accessing capital markets 
if necessary  we may also seek to obtain a waiver or renegotiate the debt covenants on our primary credit facility 
if the commission were to issue a fine in excess of our funding capability  we intend to seek approval from the commission for alternative payment measures  such as installment payments or a suspension of the payment obligation  which we are advised is available in cases of extreme hardship and substantiated financial difficulties 
it is our understanding that it is not in the commission s interest  nor is it their intention  to force companies out of business due to fine payments  and we believe that the commission will be sensitive to the current economic conditions 
however  this outcome cannot be assured due to the degree of discretion inherent in the commission s fining and enforcement powers 
the current economic conditions require us to observe that if the fine were to be issued in an amount in excess of our funding capability  and various mitigating actions which the company has implemented and is planning were to fail  the fine could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and liquidity of wabco

risk factors 
in conjunction with the tax sharing agreement  as further discussed in note  tax and indemnification liabilities transferred from trane to wabco  in notes to the consolidated financial statements  wabco is responsible for certain tax and indemnification liabilities 
these liabilities include indemnifications to trane of million related to the non us entities of trane s bath kitchen business 
the unrecognized tax benefits of million discussed further within note income taxes  includes million of unrecognized tax benefits related to trane s bath kitchen business for which wabco has obligations directly to tax authorities 
cyclical and seasonal nature of business the industry in which we operate is cyclical 
approximately of our sales are for newly manufactured trucks  buses and trailers  the production of which follows long investment cycles and are impacted by macro economic factors and legislation 
global commercial vehicle production has consistently been growing since in the fourth quarter of  however  the global commercial vehicle markets started to experience a significant decline that was unprecedented in its breadth  depth and speed which continued through the uncertainty of the development of the global economy makes it difficult to predict how demand for commercial vehicles will develop further in however  we are anticipating an increase in production from european oem s  at steady levels of demand from  as the inventory reductions at the oem s in have subsided 
the continued adoption of new technologies by truck and bus manufacturers helps our business outperform the rate of truck and bus production over the longer term 
the commercial vehicle industry is not subject to seasonal impacts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct operations through subsidiaries in most of the major countries of western europe  brazil  poland  china  south korea  india and japan as well as the us 
in addition  we conduct business in some countries through affiliated companies and partnerships in which we own or less of the stock or partnership interest 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations  which are presented in us dollars 
the largest of these exposures to currency exchange rates is between the euro and us dollar 
we believe our primary exposures to changes in currency exchange rates are associated with the following translation we face foreign currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated throughout the year 
a hypothetical weakening of all other currencies in relation to the us dollar would result in an approximate million decrease in the reported net income 
sourcing and manufacturing strategy a significant and growing portion of our products are sourced and manufactured in currencies different than the currency in which they are sold resulting in increased exposure to foreign exchange risks 
based on our expected transaction flow  a weakening of all other currencies in relation to the us dollar would result in an approximate million decrease in the reported net income 
transaction gains and losses certain of our monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity 
based on balances  a weakening of all other currencies in relation to the us dollar would result in an approximate million decrease in the expected reported net income 

table of contents the aggregate impact of a hypothetical weakening of all other currencies in relation to the us dollar relating to the abovementioned exposures would have resulted in an approximate million decrease in the reported net income 
the economic conditions that we faced in resulted in geographic shifts and a significant reduction of income when compared to previous years 
as a consequence  for full year  all foreign currency exposures as noted above are moving in the same direction and as a result eliminated our natural hedge 
however  looking at the trends in our currency risk patterns throughout the year  we believe that going forward we will again be in a position to benefit from a natural hedge
