item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements 
executive summary we are engaged primarily in the business of designing  developing and manufacturing high performance  rechargeable lithium ion batteries and battery systems for energy storage 
end markets include transportation  stationary power energy storage for utilities and renewable energy such as wind and solar power in addition to battery backup systems for the home  military applications and small cell markets 
in the transportation markets  we are developing systems to power the next generation of hybrid  plug in hybrid and electric vehicles hevs  phevs and evs 
this technology is also being developed for other transportation markets including buses and trucks as well as alternative transportation vehicles 
in addition  our enertech subsidiary specializes in small cell technology and manufactures electrodes for other battery manufacturers  commercial battery packs  prismatic cells and lithium polymer batteries and also manufactures large format cells for automotive applications 
we also conduct research and development of fuel cells and nano coating processes 
our goal is to become the leading united states based developer and manufacturer of advanced  safe  high performance lithium ion battery systems for evs  hevs  and phevs  and for related non automotive  stationary power and military markets 
our intention is to supply our products to the transportation and stationary power market segments in north america  europe and asia and the military markets in the united states 
we initially plan to manufacture and assemble our batteries in our united states based indianapolis and korea based plants  and to increase enerdel s global production capacity of cells as required 
ultimately  we envision a hub and spoke model for manufacturing and distribution  basing cell manufacturing in our indianapolis and korean facilities and locating pack assembly closer to our customers to reduce transportation expense 
in late  enertech began increasing production of large format cells used in our lithium ion battery systems produced by enerdel while continuing to manufacture small cell batteries  electrodes and other existing products 
in  we plan to invest million for additional manufacturing equipment and capacity expansion at our existing enertech facility 
in the beginning of  enerdel began ramping up its production of ev batteries in preparation for the pending volume production of the think city vehicle being manufactured by think global 
the battery packs will be assembled in our indiana facilities and are expected to begin shipping in the second quarter of this year 
we anticipate commencing production of battery packs to be used in the volvo c ev when that vehicle goes into its scheduled production in the first quarter of in addition  we have completed the process which allows us to begin utilizing funds under the million federal grant awarded in august by the united states department of energy doe  which requires us to spend one dollar of our own funds for every incentive dollar we receive 
we will implement the plan set forth in the grant application as part of our capital expansion strategy with an estimated million investment in manufacturing equipment for our new production facility in mt 
comfort  indiana  as well as additional equipment and capacity for our existing locations  with installation scheduled to begin in march we also have a pending application for a long term  low interest loan under the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing incentive program atvm to increase our battery manufacturing capacity at our indiana facilities 
we are currently seeking a loan estimated to be between million and million 
under the atvm  companies are required to contribute of the loan amount to the program award 
we expect the atvm application and award will be expedited by the completion of the federal grant process 
financial highlights in january  we purchased an additional ownership interest in enertech by issuing  shares of ener common stock  valued at approximately million  increasing our ownership from to on a fully diluted basis 
we filed a registration statement to  among other things  register securities of ener up to million for future issuance in our capital raising activities 
the registration statement became effective on february  and in may we began selling shares of ener common stock pursuant to an open market sale agreement the primary open market sale agreement with jefferies company  inc jefferies and through september sold  shares for an aggregate of million  at an average price of per share 
after deducting fees and expenses of million  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of these shares 
in january  we entered to a secondary open market sale agreement the secondary open market sale agreement with jefferies to sell shares of ener common stock for an aggregate of million 
we began selling shares in february and through march   we sold  shares at an average price of per share for net proceeds of million after deducting million in expense 
in august  we entered into a securities investment and subscription agreement with think holdings  as  a norwegian limited liability company think holdings 
think holdings is the majority owner of think global as think global  the norwegian electric car manufacturer and customer of enerdel 
from september through february  ener purchased  shares of think holdings series b convertible preferred stock for approximately million 
we also entered into a purchase and assignment agreement with bzinfin to acquire approximately million of debt pursuant to a loan facility with think global and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock of think global  the bridge loan 
as consideration  we issued  shares of ener common stock  valued at approximately million 
we have exchanged the bridge loan for approximately  shares of think holdings series b convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of think holdings series b convertible preferred stock 
the total number of warrants is based on a predetermined percentage of think holdings fully diluted share capital 
in december  we entered into a line of credit agreement  the loc agreement with ener group to establish a line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of million 
in august  ener group entered into a novation and assignment agreement with bzinfin whereby ener group assigned to bzinfin all of its rights and obligations under the loc agreement 
simultaneously  enerentered into an amended and restated line of credit agreement the a r loc agreement providing bzinfin  among other rights  the right to convert the first million of principal and related unpaid interest into shares of ener common stock at an exercise price of per share and any remaining principal and related unpaid interest into shares of ener common stock at an exercise price of per share 
results of operations the following information has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and is presented in thousands

enertech s sales have decreased approximately during  on a pro forma basis  due to an overall decline in demand for batteries due to poor worldwide economic conditions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the average foreign currency exchange rate of the korean won for the year ended december  declined approximately when compared to the same period in cost of sales have increased due to the acquisition of enertech and the costs are increasing at a higher rate than net sales as fixed costs of production  such as depreciation expense  are not reduced ratably with production volume 
included in cost of sales is depreciation expense of approximately million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the increase in salaries and benefits of million  of which million is attributable to the acquisition of enertech and million is for incentive bonuses and stock based compensation 
legal and professional fees increased million  of which million is for investor  government  media and public relations 
travel and facilities related expenses increased million  of which approximately is due to the enertech acquisition 
these increases have been partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million due to the collection of previously reserved doubtful accounts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of million directly related to the increase in our workforce and million for increases in incentive bonuses and stock based compensation 
facilities related expenses increased approximately million primarily due to rent and utilities for our noblesville  indiana facility and professional fees increased million related to legal fees incurred for filing  maintaining and protection of our patents and technology 
these increases have been partially offset by a decrease in materials and non capitalized equipment of million 
enertech comprises less than of the research and development expenses 
we present proceeds from our cost sharing arrangements with federal government agencies as a reduction of research and development expenses 
proceeds received under these contracts were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization amortization increased million related to intangible assets capitalized in connection with our acquisitions during and depreciation expense  included in operating expenses  increased million directly related to the increase in our property and equipment

the remaining estimated future straight line amortization of these deferred financing costs and debt issuance costs are estimated to be million during the overall decrease in interest expense is primarily due to reduced principal and interest on convertible notes and debenture instruments which where were converted into shares of ener common stock during the first quarter of gain loss on derivative liabilities upon the adoption of new accounting standards  we concluded certain warrants containing down round provisions and convertible bonds issued by our enertech subsidiary should be treated as derivative liabilities effective january   which has resulted in a gain on derivative liabilities of million during the year ended december  loss on foreign currency transactions foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency 
foreign currency transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid 
a change in exchange rates of the functional currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected cash flow creating a foreign currency transaction gain or loss

gain loss on derivative liabilities the conversion feature of our debenture instruments and related warrants were required to be treated separately as derivative liabilities 
when the debenture instruments were converted into shares of ener common stock  during the first quarter of  they no longer were treated as derivative liabilities and the fair value of each derivative  including the warrant derivative  was marked to market and a gain of million was recorded 
loss on foreign currency transactions foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency

liquidity and capital resources cash flow summary the following information has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and is presented in thousands 
we completed the acquisition of enertech during the fourth quarter of and have included the results of their operations since november  cash and cash equivalents increased by million during the year ended december  the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows in thousands net loss non cash items decrease increase in working capital items operating activities investing activities financing activities effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning balance cash and cash equivalents ending balance operating activities cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our net loss  adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital 
non cash items consist primarily of depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and interest expense  which are partially offset by the gain on derivative liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities increased million during the year ended december   as compared to non cash items decreased million and working capital items decreased million 
the decrease in certain operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by the decrease in inventories and accounts receivable 
net cash used in operating activities decreased million during the year ended december   as compared to net loss decreased million in due primarily to the payment of million in preferred dividends during non cash items decreased million primarily due to the gain on derivative liabilities of million in as compared to the loss of million during working capital items increased million primarily due to the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable due to the slow paying nature of certain federal government agencies with whom we have cost sharing arrangements 
subsequent to december   we collected approximately million  or of our government based accounts receivable 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the investment in think holdings series b preferred stock of million during purchases of property  plant and equipment increased million as we continue to upgrade and increase the capacity at our manufacturing facilities in indiana and korea 
net cash used in investing activities increased million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase relates primarily to the planned increase in capacity and upgrade of production equipment at our manufacturing facilities in indiana and korea 
during  capital expenditures and equipment deposits increased million 
these increases were partially offset by the million cash received in acquisitions  less million in direct costs of acquisitions 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period ended the increase is due to proceeds from sales of ener common stock of million and an increase in proceeds from borrowings of million during the year ended december  these increases have been partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants of million during the same period 
in may  we entered into the primary open market sale agreement to sell million in shares of ener common stock and through september  we raised net proceeds of million from our participation in the primary open market sale agreement 
in december  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with itochu to sell million in shares of ener common stock 
in january  we entered into the secondary open market sale agreement to sell up to million in shares of ener common stock 
we began selling shares on february  and through march   we raised net proceeds totaling million 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million during the year ended december  primarily due to the decrease in selling activities of ener common stock 
this decrease is partially offset by the increase in proceeds from exercises of warrants totaling million during we also spent million during the year ended for the redemption of enerdel s series a preferred stock 
management s assessment of liquidity we continue to manage our business to develop our products and establish our manufacturing capacity at a level to attract customers while reserving the expansion of our capacity and workforce until such time as we receive firm customer orders 
in addition to our available cash on hand  sources of liquidity include committed credit lines for equipment purchases and operating expenses as well as access to the public debt and equity markets 
we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our planned operations  equipment purchases  acquisition activity and redemption of certain securities 
we anticipate that united states government programs will fund a significant increase in investment in the domestic battery business and related supplier markets  and we will benefit from these programs due to our presence as a united states based manufacturer 
funds received pursuant to these government programs are designated to increase our battery manufacturing capacity 
in january  we completed the process to begin utilizing funds under the million grant awarded in august we will begin utilizing these funds as part of our capital expansion with an estimated million investment in our new production facility in mt 
comfort  indiana  and to fund the purchase of additional equipment and capacity expansion at our existing locations 
we also have pending an application under the doe atvm loan program under which we are seeking a loan currently estimated to be between million and million to increase our battery manufacturing capacity in indiana 
under the atvm  companies are required to contribute of the loan amount to the program award  with credit given for invested capital in the project to date in accordance with the terms and conditions of the atvm loan 
we continue to provide information and due diligence requests to the doe in accordance with the application process 
the atvm was created under section of the energy independence and security act of we expect to receive million from our active cost sharing arrangements with the dod  doe and the usabc through september  which will reduce our future research and development expense 
our ability to access the public debt and equity markets and the related cost of these activities may be affected by market conditions and our credit rating 
during the past year  the market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
to date  we have not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity  although the recent upheaval experienced by the debt and equity markets may adversely affect our ability to procure future financing 
we believe we have access to sufficient capital to continue our planned operations for months from our balance sheet date of december  we plan to utilize the proceeds from our secondary open market sale agreement and our a r loc and other possible sources to fund operations and the purchase of certain production equipment and manufacturing plant assets 
enertech has access to loan facilities with several banks for short term working capital and equipment purchases and we plan to invest approximately million in enertech during to facilitate their working capital and equipment purchase requirements 
contractual obligations a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commitments  as of december   is presented below in thousands after contractual cash obligations total convertible line of credit short term borrowings  long term borrowings  convertible bonds capital lease obligations operating lease obligations capital expenditures totals includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations 
certain bank deposits  land  buildings and equipment are pledged as collateral to guarantee payment 
approximately million will qualify for reimbursement under the grant awarded in august and expected proceeds under the atvm loan 
off balance sheet financing we do not have any significant relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding uncertainties that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
we base our estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates  judgments and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies for us include impairment of intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets  revenue recognition  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes and derivative instruments 
our critical accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
this summary of critical accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements and the major estimates  judgments and assumptions used 
management believes the following are its most critical accounting policies because they require more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  as well as intangible assets  may be impaired 
we take into consideration indicators such as reductions in demand  a significant economic slowdown in the industry or underperformance of the asset or a significant adverse change in the manner or extent to which the asset is used 
if such circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist  we then evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset based on estimated undiscounted cash flow projections to be generated from such asset 
if the undiscounted cash flow projections indicate an impairment occurred then the carrying value of the assets being evaluated is written down to the estimated fair value 
all of our long lived assets are subject to depreciation or amortization 
no impairment of long lived assets has been identified during any of the periods presented since indicators of impairment were not present 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the difference  if any  between the purchase price paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment annually  unless an event occurs that indicates a potential impairment exists 
the performance of the impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method 
this valuation method requires a projection of revenue  operating expenses  and capital expenditures over a five to ten year period 
in addition  management estimates the weighted average cost of capital to determine an appropriate discount rate 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
our annual impairment test was performed on october  and indicated our goodwill was not impaired 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million which has been assigned to the battery segment 
changes in our projections  a decrease in our revenue estimates or an increase in the discount rate by more than percentage points could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss are transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable and there are no remaining significant obligations or customer acceptance requirements 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment when title transfers and risk of loss occurs 
ener offers customers a right of return and reserves for such returns are estimated using historical information 
during the year ended december   our net sales consist primarily of battery related sales from our enertech operations and a small amount of battery prototype sales from our enerdel subsidiary 
at enertech  sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is at the delivery point for domestic sales and at the receipt point of bill of lading for export sales 
currently  enertech does not provide discounts  rebates  product guarantees or warranties 
we expect  in the future  that enerdel will be providing a limited warranty on sales of battery packs for evs  phevs and hevs 
the terms of such warranties and other post shipment obligations may be negotiated on a customer by customer basis and we will establish the appropriate policies and accounting treatment based on such negotiations and final agreements 
we also expect that our customers will test a significant number of battery packs prior to acceptance 
proceeds from cost sharing arrangements with federal government agencies and grants from foreign government agencies are generally recognized as a reduction of research and development expenses 
revenue in from cost sharing arrangements with commercial entities was generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
to date  these cost sharing arrangements with commercial entities have been for the development and sale of a customer specified prototype and the costs incurred are classified as research and development expenses 
we expect to receive proceeds from grants with federal government agencies  during  related to assets which we anticipate being recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the periods and in proportions in which depreciation on the assets is charged 
stock based compensation employee and non employee stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  usually three years  using the straight line method 
we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our stock based compensation 
in connection with valuing stock options  we use a black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected term of the award  the expected forfeitures  and the dividend yield 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based compensation awards granted in the future 
such changes may result in a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with such awards 
income taxes income tax expense includes domestic and foreign income taxes 
certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year 
the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes 
we also recognized future tax benefits associated with tax loss and credit carryforwards as deferred tax assets 
we establish valuation allowances on a jurisdictional basis when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization of the future tax benefit related to the deferred tax asset is dependent on many factors  including our ability to generate taxable income within the period during which the temporary differences reverse  the outlook for the economic environment in which we operate and the overall future industry outlook 
derivative instruments our foreign subsidiary has derivative instruments for managing exposure to foreign currency primarily to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from accounts receivable from domestic subsidiaries 
these derivative instruments are measured at fair value and gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings  as they are not designated as hedges 
certain freestanding warrants that contain down round provisions were issued during and previously  these warrants were classified in equity 
after evaluating the application of newly issued us gaap  these warrants were no longer deemed to be indexed to ener s common stock and on january  were reclassified as a derivative liability 
any time we issue securities that are deemed to be dilutive to the warrants containing down round provisions  the number of shares of ener stock required to be issued upon the exercise of these warrants will increase 
convertible bonds  originally issued in january  which have a strike price denominated in a foreign currency  were acquired in connection with the enertech acquisition during the fourth quarter of after evaluating the application of newly issued us gaap  the conversion feature was bifurcated and recorded as a derivative liability on january  as foreign currency rates fluctuate  the number of shares of enertech stock to be issued upon conversion could increase 
we have recorded the fair value of the warrants and convertible bonds that are classified as derivative liabilities in our balance sheet at fair value with changes in the value of these derivatives reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as gain or loss on derivative liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments 
recently adopted accounting standards effective january   we adopted new accounting guidance for determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to our own stock 
the new guidance has affected the accounting for i certain freestanding warrants that contain exercise price adjustment features down round provisions and ii convertible bonds issued by our foreign subsidiary with a strike price denominated in a foreign currency 
we adopted new accounting guidance on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities on january  the new guidance impacts disclosures only and requires additional qualitative and quantitative information on the use of derivatives and their impact on an entity s financial statements 
in january  we adopted new accounting guidance on business combinations 
the new guidance requires an acquiring company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies  at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in addition  an acquiring company is required to capitalize in process research and development and either amortize it over the life of the product  or write it off if the project is abandoned or impaired 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
on january   we adopted new accounting guidance on fair value measurements 
this new guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements on january   we adopted new accounting guidance that requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately account for the debt and equity components in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
we continue to examine our convertible debt instruments for applicability under this guidance 
in june  we adopted new guidance which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements 
in september  we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification the codification  as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
future adoption of accounting standards in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which amends previously issued accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities to require an enterprise to determine whether its variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this new standard has broad implications and may affect how we account for the consolidation of equity method investments and other agreements and purchase arrangements 
under this revised guidance  more entities may meet the definition of a variable interest entity 
we have evaluated all entities that fall within the scope of this amended guidance to determine whether we may be required to consolidate additional entities on january   which is the effective date and determined that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have international operations which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risks 
when we conduct our business in foreign countries  our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we also face transactional currency exposures that arise when our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their own local currency 
the loss on foreign currency transactions during the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
in addition  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from translating the results of our korean and japanese operations to the united states dollar 
at december  and  the translation adjustment recognized as accumulated comprehensive income was million and million  respectively 
we do not have any long term supply agreements at this time but we are exposed to risk when purchases are denominated in a foreign currency 
currently  the majority of our principal suppliers are based in china  japan and korea and we may not be able to negotiate payment terms that are denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  any future decline in the united states dollar against the chinese yuan  the japanese yen or the korean won  will increase the amount we may have to pay and could have material impact on our financial statements 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for purposes of reducing our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are not exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates due to the fixed nature of interest rates associated with our debt instruments
