the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
as described at the beginning of this annual report on form k  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed at the beginning of this annual report  below in this section and in the section above entitled risk factors 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect new information  events or circumstances after the date of this report  or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop  produce  market and distribute a range of premium beverages  including the following four brands as of the date of this report jones pure cane soda  a premium carbonated soft drink with three new extensions launched in targeted markets during jones refresco de ca a pura  jones jumble tm  our seasonal soda  and jones zilch tm  our zero calorie offering  jones c  an enhanced water beverage  jones gaba  a functional tea juice blend  and whoopass energy drink  a citrus energy drink 
we sell and distribute our products primarily throughout the united states us and canada through our network of independent distributors  which we refer to as our direct store delivery dsd channel  national retail accounts  which we refer to as our direct to retail dtr channel  as well as through licensing arrangements 
we do not directly manufacture our products but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third party contract packers 
in  we expanded our distribution to the grocery and mass merchant channel in the us with our exclusive manufacturing and distribution agreement with national beverage corp 
national beverage  which we refer to as our concentrate soda distribution csd channel 
through this arrangement  we identify and secure retailers across the us for jones soda ounce cans  and we are responsible for sales efforts  marketing  advertising and promotion 
using concentrate supplied by jones  national beverage both manufactures and sells on an exclusive basis the products directly to retailers 
however  beginning in  we have changed our strategic direction  emphasizing our higher margin  core products  including our jones pure cane soda glass bottle business  with less emphasis on our csd channel  which is a lower margin business for us 
to this end  in december  we introduced our new packaging for our core glass bottles  the first time our packaging had been completely refreshed in almost years 
the new look is distinctly jones updated with higher resolution printing designed to improve shelf presence for our brand 
we believe the new packaging highlights our portfolio of flavors while also delivering a cohesive  sustainable brand message to our consumers 
our products are sold in states in the us and nine provinces in canada  primarily in convenience stores  delicatessens  sandwich shops and selected supermarkets  as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers 
we also sell various products on line  which we refer to as our interactive channel  
table of contents including soda with customized labels  wearables  candy and other items 
we have focused our sales and marketing resources on the expansion and penetration of our products through our independent distributor network and national retail accounts in our core markets consisting of the northwest  southwest and midwest us and canada  as well as targeted expansion into our less penetrated markets consisting of the northeast and southeast us in addition  we are expanding our international business outside of north america and have secured distribution with independent distributors in ireland  the united kingdom  australia  japan and the united arab emirates 
beginning in  we launched our licensing business strategy as a method to extend our brand into non alternative beverage products and non beverage products 
we currently have licensing arrangements with three companies 
with these licensing agreements  we believe that we are able to partner with companies that will manufacture jones related products and extend our jones brand into select products that we feel enhance our brand image 
we do not expect this business to be a material part of our operations in our business strategy is to increase sales by expanding distribution of our brands in new and existing markets primarily within north america  stimulating consumer awareness and trial of our products  thus leading to increased relevance and purchase intent of our brands 
our business strategy focuses on expanding points of distribution for our products  creating strong alignment with our key distributors  developing innovative beverage brands and products  stimulating strong consumer demand for our existing brands and products  with primary emphasis in the us and canada  inviting consumers to participate in our brand through submission of photographs to be placed on labels through our interactive application of myjones 
com  licensing our brand equity for the creation of other beverage or non beverage products  and exploring opportunities to license our patented custom label process to non competitive products 
in order to compete effectively in the beverage industry  we believe that we must convince independent distributors that jones pure cane soda is a leading brand in the premium soda segment of the alternative or new age beverage industry 
additionally  as a means of maintaining and expanding our distribution network  we introduce new products and product extensions  and when warranted  new brands 
during the year we have launched three new product extensions of our jones pure cane soda listed above and one new brand  jones gaba 
launched in february  jones gaba  is our first line of beverage products containing pharma gaba  is offered in a ounce slim can  and is part of a new emerging category of functional beverages 
we are marketing this tea and juice blended beverage by focusing on the benefits of enhanced focus and clarity that studies have shown gaba provides 
our results with respect to jones gaba depend in part on our ability to market the product s benefits 
jones gaba is our first entry into the new emerging category of functional beverages and is our first beverage product containing gaba 
we allocated significant resources in our efforts to launch jones gaba in under our pharma gaba supply agreement  we were required to purchase a significant quantity of the gaba ingredient 
we had certain purchase obligations under the supply agreement  including the requirement to order million of gaba by december  however  the impact of the economic conditions during on our business  was more severe than we expected  including on the launch of our new product  jones gaba  and limited our ability to invest in sales and marketing resources towards this launch 
as a result  sales of gaba have been lower than expected  and we recorded a charge for the gaba inventory that was in excess of our forecasted demand resulting in a write down of million for the year ended december   of which  related to gaba finished goods inventory 

table of contents the beverage industry  and particularly those companies selling premium beverages like us  can be affected by macroeconomic factors including changes in national  regional  and local economic conditions  unemployment levels and consumer spending patterns  which together may impact the willingness of consumers to purchase our products as they adjust their discretionary spending 
the recent disruptions in the overall economy and financial markets as a result of the global economic downturn have adversely impacted our two primary markets the us and canada 
this has reduced consumer confidence in the economy and we believe has negatively affected consumers willingness to purchase our products as they reduce their discretionary spending 
moreover  current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors to obtain the credit necessary to fund their working capital needs  which could negatively impact their ability or desire to continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they have done in the past 
there can be no assurances that the financial markets will stabilize or recover in the months ahead  that consumer confidence will be restored  or that access to the credit markets will become available 
if the current economic conditions persist or deteriorate  sales of our products could be adversely affected  collectability of accounts receivable may be compromised and we may face obsolescence issues with our inventory  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
during  we refined our operating plan each quarter to contemplate lower case sales than we had previously contemplated  but our actual case sales continued to be lower than our revised expectations 
despite the further refinements and cost cutting measures we implemented during  we may no longer have sufficient margin in our operating plan to absorb further declines against our expectations with regard to the economy or our business 
we believe our operating plan already includes the majority of attainable cost cutting measures  which places greater emphasis on the need to meet our case sales projections in order to effectively operate our business 
the economic conditions in and the beginning of have made forecasting demand for our products extremely difficult  so there is continued uncertainty regarding our ability to meet our revised case sales projections 
our current operating plan does not depend upon obtaining financing and if achieved  would allow us to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next months 
however as we build inventory to prepare for our stronger shipping months of april through september  we expect our cash balance to fall to approximately million  excluding the impact of any funding through potential debt or equity financing  before we would expect our cash balance to increase in the second half of the year 
additionally  if our sales volumes further decline in a material way from our expectations during as a result of worsening economic conditions or otherwise  and since we would not likely be able to further reduce our costs by a sufficient amount  we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the balance of the year 
further  based on our current projections beyond  we expect that we will deplete our cash in the first half of as such  we believe we will likely need to secure financing during or early in order to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in although we believe we have financing alternatives available to us  these alternatives would likely involve significant interest and other costs or would likely be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we continue to monitor whether credit facilities may be available to us on acceptable terms 
there can be no assurance any debt or equity financing arrangement will be available to us when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these financing alternatives would provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long term capital requirements 
if we are unable to secure additional financing or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital and capital expenditures requirements  we may be forced to explore liquidation alternatives  including seeking protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws 
in light of our liquidity position  we have evaluated a broad range of strategic alternatives over the last months including a potential merger transaction see overview in item of this report 
we intend to continue to explore strategic transactions that may be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders  which may include  without limitation  mergers or other business combinations  public or private offerings of debt or equity financings  joint ventures with one or more strategic partners and other strategic alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that we will enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction 
table of contents or that any transaction we may enter into will ultimately be consummated 
additionally  a transaction will likely be subject to approval of our shareholders 
these uncertainties  together with our inability to implement further meaningful cost containment measures beyond those we have already undertaken and the extremely difficult environment in which to obtain additional equity or debt financing  continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern see liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue was approximately million  a decrease of million  or from million in revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in total case sales of to million cases 
case sales through our dtr and dsd channels decreased to million cases 
a decline in case sales of our core product  jones soda glass bottles  of approximately  cases contributed to the reduced case sales  and we believe was caused primarily by the discontinuance of jones soda glass bottles at some of our major retailers in our dtr channel  which occurred in as part of our realigned channel focus 
in addition  we believe reduced demand resulting from the impact of the economic downturn on consumer spending levels negatively affected our case sales  and we expect economic conditions to continue to have a negative impact on our business into also contributing to the decline was a reduction in c shipments of  cases  c had stronger pull through a year ago subsequent to its launch in due to significant pricing pressure we experienced with the c product  we are targeting more select  regionalized markets in which to sell for  which we expect to negatively impact volumes in additionally  case sales of concentrate to national beverage decreased to  cases  or  compared to as part of management s strategic refocus  we intend to continue to emphasize our higher margin core products  including our jones pure cane soda glass bottle business and the product extensions initiated in including jones zilch tm  with less emphasis on our csd channel  which is a lower margin business for us 
additionally  in early  we received notice from several of our significant dtr customers that they will no longer be carrying the jones brand 
we have discontinued the jones organics tm and jones naturals brands due to this loss in business 
we expect our change in strategy to focus on our higher margin core products and the loss of these significant dtr customers will have a negative impact on case sales compared to prior periods 
for the year ended december   promotion allowances and slotting fees  which are a reduction to revenue  totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from million a year ago 
the promotion allowances and slotting fees in were primarily attributable to promoting some new distribution points in our dsd channel 
the promotion allowances and slotting fees in related primarily to price promotion programs implemented for our dtr and csd channels and for the continued introduction of c across north america 
we believe using promotional allowances as a way to promote our core products  while judiciously using slotting fees to gain access on new products  is a more balanced strategy under current economic conditions 
we anticipate continuing this strategy in  with further overall reductions in our promotional allowance and slotting fee costs and emphasis on our higher margin business  including our core glass bottle business 
gross profit year ended december  change dollars in thousands gross profit of revenue for the year ended december   gross profit decreased by approximately million or  to million as compared to million in gross profit for the year ended december  this 
table of contents decrease was primarily a result of a million charge  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter  consisting of a million write down of excess gaba inventory and a  impairment of equipment located at a co packer relating to our csd channel 
additionally  contributing to our lower gross profit were lower sales volumes in our dtr channel due to discontinuance of the jones soda glass bottles at some of our major dtr customers and lower dsd volumes in the majority of us regions  due we believe  to softer consumer demand as a result of the economic downturn 
these decreases to gross profit were offset by a reduction in promotion allowances and slotting fees  a significant reduction in freight and storage costs per case due to reduced fuel surcharges compared to and improved inventory management 
for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to  comprised of relating to our gross profit on case sales offset by relating to the million in inventory write down and impairment charges  compared to for the year ended december  licensing revenue licensing revenue decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of our exclusive licensing arrangements with big sky brands for jones soda flavor booster hard candy 
we believe licensing revenue was down due to the negative impact on sales resulting from the economic downturn 
we do not expect licensing revenue to represent a material portion of our overall revenues in promotion and selling expenses promotion and selling expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  promotion and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december   from in the decrease in promotion and selling expenses was primarily due to a decrease in selling expenses year over year of million  to million  or of revenue 
this decrease resulted primarily from decreases in sales personnel in conjunction with the strategic refocus in the fourth quarter of and continued cost containment efforts during  including reductions in workforce and our realigned channel focus which contributed to a decrease in promotional expense  broker and invasion fees 
the full year effects of the workforce reductions on are expected to reduce ongoing promotion and selling expenses compared to also contributing to the decrease in promotion and selling expenses was a  decrease in trade promotion and marketing expenses from million to million  or of revenue  due in part to our cost containment efforts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from in the same period of the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease of salaries and benefits primarily as a result of the strategic refocus in the fourth quarter of and continued cost containment efforts during  which included reductions in workforce  and the reduction in executive transition expenses experienced in of approximately  a decrease in bad debt expense and a decrease in professional fees 
the full year effects of the workforce reductions on are expected to reduce ongoing general and administrative expenses compared to other expense income  net other expense income  net decreased to an expense of  for the year ended december   from other income of  in  primarily due to a decrease in interest income due to lower levels of cash and short term investments 

table of contents income tax expense provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the tax provision for the year ended december  relates primarily to the tax provision on income from our canadian operations 
no tax benefit is recorded for the loss in our us operations as we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved us operations 
our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors  including the forecasted mix of income before taxes in various jurisdictions  estimated permanent differences and the recording of a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million from a net loss of million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a decrease in promotion and selling expense of million and general and administrative expense of million as a result of decreases in salaries and benefits primarily due to headcount reductions and cost containment efforts 
offsetting these decreases was a reduction in gross profit of million as a result of million in inventory write down and impairment charges and lower sales in our dtr channel driven by the decline in sales of jones soda glass bottles  as well as lower dsd volumes in the majority of us regions we believe as a result of reduced overall demand resulting from the economic downturn 
included in the million charge  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter  was a million write down of excess gaba inventory and a  impairment charge for equipment located at a co packer relating to our csd channel 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million and million  respectively  and working capital of million and million  respectively 
cash used in operations during and totaled million and million  respectively 
we used million of cash in operations during the quarter ended december  our cash flows vary throughout the year based on seasonality 
we traditionally use more cash in the first half of the year as we build inventory to support our historically seasonally stronger shipping months of april through september  and expect cash used by operating activities to decrease in the second half of the year as we collect receivables generated during our stronger shipping months 
in addition  the cash used in the first half of included approximately million to purchase raw materials under the terms of our amended pharma gaba supply agreement  and no gaba purchase requirements remain as of december  for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately  and million  respectively  due primarily to the sales of short term investments  partially offset by the purchases of fixed assets  and for  by the purchase of the certificate of deposit required to secure our promissory note referred to below 
net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december   totaled approximately  due to the repayment of capital lease obligations offset by the proceeds from the note payable resulting from the consolidation of our capital leases into one promissory note for a lower interest rate 
this compares to net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december   which totaled approximately  due to the payments on our capital lease obligations offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   which included a charge of million consisting of a million write down of our gaba inventory and  for the impairment of fixed assets see note in item of this report 
our accumulated deficit increased to million as of december  compared to the prior year s deficit of million 
our ability to execute on our operating plan and to manage our costs in light of persisting adverse economic conditions continues to be critical to the success and the performance of our business 
the impact of these economic conditions during on our business  including on the launch of our new product  jones 
table of contents gaba  was more severe than we expected 
we refined our operating plan each quarter to contemplate lower case sales than we had previously contemplated  but our actual case sales continued to be lower than our revised expectations 
as such  we took into account several factors in developing our operating plan which we refer to in this section as our operating plan or our plan 
we considered the macroeconomic factors stemming from the global economic downturn and its effects on our results  believing that these economic conditions will likely continue in the beverage industry  and particularly those companies selling premium beverages like us  can be affected by macroeconomic factors  including changes in national  regional  and local economic conditions  unemployment levels and consumer spending patterns  which together may impact the willingness of consumers to purchase our products as they adjust their discretionary spending 
our case sales volumes in our operating plan  including comparable case sales volume of jones gaba  are based in part on our results during this economic downturn and have been further refined for the loss of one of our significant direct to retail dtr national accounts 
our operating plan takes into account our continued focus on higher margin core products  including our jones pure cane soda glass bottle business  with less emphasis on our concentrate soda distribution csd channel  which is a lower margin business for us 
our operating plan also factors in the use of cash to meet our contractual obligations for totaling approximately million 
a substantial portion of these contractual obligations approximately of the total for consists of obligations to purchase raw materials  including sugar and glass under our supply agreements 
we enter into these supply agreements in order to fix the cost of these key raw materials  which we expect will be used in the ordinary course of our business in approximately of these contractual obligations relate to payments for sponsorships 
given our limited cash resources  we intend to attempt to renegotiate these arrangements to reduce our payment obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to modify these sponsorship arrangements in a timely manner to reduce our obligations or make any other changes 
with respect to our operating expenses  our operating plan also takes into account the cost containment measures we implemented in the fourth quarter of and throughout  including reductions in workforce resulting in a combined headcount reduction 
additionally  our senior level positions in have been reduced as the result of the departures of our former chief executive officer  executive vice president of sales  and vp of sales during we believe these cost containment measures and our decision to proceed with fewer senior level positions are critical to our achieving a reduced cost structure that supports our operating goals 
our operating expenses for were lower  a reduction of million compared to  and our operating plan for contemplates a full year of these cost reductions 
with this reduced cost structure our operating plan  if achieved  would allow us to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next months 
however  as we build inventory to prepare for our stronger shipping months of april through september  we expect our cash balance to fall to approximately million  excluding the impact of any funding through potential debt or equity financing  before we would expect our cash balance to increase in the second half of the year 
our current operating plan does not depend upon obtaining financing 
however  if our sales volumes further decline in a material way from our expectations during as a result of worsening economic conditions or otherwise  and since we would not likely be able to further reduce our costs by a sufficient amount  we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the balance of the year 
further  based on our current projections beyond  we expect that we will deplete our cash in the first half of as such  we believe we will likely need to secure financing during or early in order to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in although we believe we have financing alternatives available to us  these alternatives would likely involve significant interest and other costs or would likely be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we continue to monitor whether credit facilities may be available to us on acceptable terms 
there can be no assurance any debt or equity financing arrangement will be available to us when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these financing alternatives would provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long term capital requirements 
if we are unable to secure additional financing or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital and capital expenditures requirements  we may be forced to explore liquidation alternatives  including seeking protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws 

table of contents in light of our liquidity position  we have evaluated a broad range of strategic alternatives over the last months including a potential merger transaction see business in item of this report 
we intend to continue to explore strategic transactions that may be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders  which may include  without limitation  mergers or other business combinations  public or private offerings of debt or equity financings  joint ventures with one or more strategic partners and other strategic alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that we will enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction or that any transaction we may enter into will ultimately be consummated 
additionally  the transaction will likely be subject to approval of our shareholders 
we intend to continually monitor and adjust our business plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business  our markets and the broader economy 
however  despite the further refinements we have made to our operating plan and the additional cost containment measures we implemented in the third quarter  we may no longer have sufficient margin in our plan to absorb further declines against our expectations with regard to the economy or our business 
we believe our operating plan already includes the majority of attainable cost cutting measures  which places greater emphasis on the need to meet our case sales projections in order to effectively operate our business 
the economic conditions in and the beginning of have made forecasting demand for our products extremely difficult  so there is continued uncertainty regarding our ability to meet our revised case sales projections 
also  there can be no assurance that we will consummate a strategic transaction 
these uncertainties  together with our inability to implement further meaningful cost containment measures beyond those we have already undertaken and the extremely difficult environment in which to obtain additional equity or debt financing  continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements for the year ended december  were prepared assuming we would continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
contractual obligations our commitments as of december  with respect to known contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years loan obligation operating lease obligations sponsorships purchase obligations total our loan obligation consists of a promissory note we entered into with key bank in september  totaling  for the purpose of consolidating our capital leases with key bank  into one note for a lower interest rate 
although our fixed assets are no longer secured  we were required  as a term of the financing  to place  in an interest bearing restricted reserve account  invested in a certificate of deposit  to secure the note 
the terms of the arrangement include monthly payments of principal and interest for months and an annual percentage rate of prime  which was  at december  interest expense for  and is expected to total approximately   and  respectively 
our sponsorship obligations include commitments under our sponsorship agreements with the seattle seahawks  the new jersey nets and the portland trail blazers 
these obligations vary in terms and commit us to payments from to we describe these arrangements in sponsorship arrangements in item of this report 

table of contents purchase obligations reflected in the table above include approximately million in sugar under our supply agreements with our three pure cane sugar suppliers and approximately million in glass under our supply agreement with our glass supplier 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
see item legal proceedings for disclosure of the federal securities class action  shareholder derivative litigation and shareholder merger litigation 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these actions 
these actions could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
many of our estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance  and as such are forward looking in nature  and are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances 
there are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified below our accounting policies and estimates that we consider critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this is not a complete list of all of our accounting policies  and there may be other accounting policies that are significant to us 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and our other accounting policies  see note in item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recorded net of provisions for discounts  slotting fees and allowances 
such incentives are recognized as a reduction in revenue at the later of the date on which the related revenue is recognized or a commitment is made  except in the case of slotting which is recognized when the commitment is made 
with respect to our dsd and dtr channels  our products are sold on various terms for cash or credit 
our credit terms  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices  typically require payment within days of delivery 
we recognize revenue upon receipt of our products by our distributors and retail customers in accordance with written sales terms  net of provisions for discounts and allowances 
all sales to distributors and customers are final sales  however  in limited instances  due to product quality issues or distributor terminations  we may accept returned product 
to date  such returns have not been material 
with respect to our csd channel  we recognize revenue from the sale of concentrate to national beverage on a gross basis upon receipt of concentrate by national beverage 
the selling price and terms of 
table of contents sale of concentrate to national beverage are determined in accordance with our manufacturing and distribution agreement with them 
our credit terms from the sale of concentrate typically require payment within days of delivery 
generally we do not accept returns on sales of concentrate to national beverage  however  in limited instances  due to product quality or other custom package commitments  we may accept returned product 
to date  such returns have not been material 
licensing revenue is recorded when we receive a sale confirmation from the third party 
inventory we hold raw materials and finished goods inventories  which are manufactured and procured based on our sales forecasts 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  which is based on estimated net realizable value  and include adjustments for estimated obsolete or excess inventory  on a first in first out basis 
these valuations are subject to customer acceptance  planned and actual product changes  demand for the particular products  and our estimates of future realizable values based on these forecasted demands 
we regularly review inventory detail to determine whether a write down is necessary 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
the amount and timing of write downs for any period could change if we make different judgments or use different estimates 
we also determine whether a provision for obsolete or excess inventory is required on products that are over months from production date or any changes related to market conditions  slow moving inventory or obsolete products 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which include capital and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of the assets is estimated using the higher of discounted future cash flows of the assets or estimated net realizable value 
long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when evaluating for impairment 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell
