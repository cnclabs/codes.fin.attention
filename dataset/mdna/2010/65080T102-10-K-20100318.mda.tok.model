item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following presents management s discussion and analysis of bancorp s consolidated financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of bancorp 
bancorp s principal source of income is from dividends declared and paid by the bank on its issued and outstanding capital stock 
the majority of bancorp s operations occur at the bank level 
throughout this discussion  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  results of operations will often be discussed by referring to the bank s operations  unless a specific reference is made to bancorp and its operating results apart from those of the bank 
executive overview the year ended december  was another challenging year for the us  including the areas served by the bank  which continued to suffer from the effects of the economic down turn that began more than a year earlier 
a depressed real estate market  increasing numbers of foreclosures  historically high levels of unemployment  and reduced business activity and consumer spending resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  in turn causing many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
despite these difficult economic conditions  we experienced a number of successes during  including returning to profitability during the fourth quarter of  achieving significant reductions in operating and credit related costs  establishing an allowance for credit losses that compares favorable with peer institutions through early recognition of credit losses  completing the acquisition of the business operations of bradford mortgage company  and maintaining bancorp s and the bank s capital levels well above the regulatory levels required to be considered well capitalized 
our goal is to put this adverse credit cycle behind us as quickly as possible  through early recognition of credit losses 
we believe we have been largely successful in identifying and taking aggressive action with our problem credits  and have positioned bancorp to take advantage of opportunities that arise when we emerge from the recession and to reward our shareholders 
our community bank strategy and operating plan background 
bancorp was created in july  following the merger of equals between fnb and lsb 
in november  the subsidiary banks of fnb and lsb  fnb southeast and lsb bank  merged to form newbridge bank  which became the largest community bank in the piedmont triad region of north carolina 
in july pressley a 
ridgill was named chief executive officer of bancorp  having become president of bancorp  and chief executive officer and president of the bank in mr 
ridgill was previously president and chief executive officer of fnb 
during mr 
ridgill enhanced his executive management team 
the management team members were selected for their talents  experience and commitment to bancorp s guiding principles and basic concept that financial success begins with integrity 
during the executive management team began to re define and implement our community bank strategy and operating plan 

table of contents strategy 
as a community bank  we believe that the bank s ability to secure significant returns for our shareholders can best be achieved through consistent delivery of superior client service to small and mid size businesses and consumers in a manner that the large national and super regional banks are unable or unwilling to emulate 
as of december  all but five of the bank s branch offices are located in the piedmont triad region  a market with approximately billion of deposits 
this market is dominated by large national and regional banks  with approximately of the market s deposits residing in banks with more than billion of assets  and only of those balances held at our bank 
consequently  our strategy is to focus on growing the bank s market share in the piedmont triad region  where a relatively small increase in market share has the potential to deliver extraordinary gains for bancorp 
operating plan 
to ensure the effective implementation of our strategy  management developed our and operating plans to include measurable goals that communicate throughout the organization the steps needed to improve bancorp s financial results 
the operating plan objectives for include improve asset quality  manage the net interest margin  increase noninterest income  control noninterest expense  and position the company to fulfill its vision and mission 
improve asset quality management s primary objective is to put the adverse affects of the recession behind us as quickly as possible through early recognition of credit losses 
we believe we have been largely successful in identifying and taking appropriate aggressive action with our problem credits 
we believe that this prudent approach allows us to continue through the remainder of with the expectation that our future financial performance will benefit from lower credit related costs 
at december  non performing assets increased million to million or of total assets  from million or of total assets at december  non performing loans totaled million at december  and were down  or million  from their peak level at june  at december  the allowance for credit losses totaled million  or of total loans and of non performing loans 
with most specific losses being recognized directly as charge offs  the bank s allowance for loan losses consists primarily of non specific allowances for loans that are not impaired 
specific impairments have been largely recognized in net charge offs that totaled million for the twelve months ending december  since the beginning of the declining credit cycle  charge offs have totaled million 
of the remaining million of non performing loans  we believe that losses have largely been recognized through the million of charge offs 
manage the net interest margin net interest income is the bank s primary source of revenue  and is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
in order to effectively manage our net interest income  management must manage the bank s net interest margin  which is the net yield on earning assets less the cost of interest bearing liabilities  as well as its level of earning assets and funding mix 
during management began to implement several steps to improve its management and control of the net interest margin  including enhance our interest rate risk management tools 
early in management engaged an outside consultant to begin preparing management s interest rate risk management tools 
our selected vendor works with more than banks across the country and has been a leader in the asset liability management field since the s 
reduce the bank s dependence on high cost time deposits in favor of lower cost core accounts  including dda  now checking  money market and savings accounts 
price loans consistently while considering relationship pricing for deposit and other key relationships 

table of contents implement a more disciplined and accountable budget process to include monitoring loan  investment and deposit yields and balances so that variances are questioned and controllable items are controlled 
while net interest income declined million in to million  net interest income and the net interest margin improved steadily throughout in the fourth quarter of net interest income exceeded net interest income during the fourth quarter by million  totaling million for the three months ending december  the increase in net interest income for the fourth quarter of was due primarily to a basis point rise in the bank s net interest margin from during the three months ended june  to for the three months ended december  the margin improved during the year as the cost of time deposits fell 
the weighted average deposit cost fell basis points to for the quarter ending december   compared to for the quarter ending december  during the bank faced irrational deposit pricing pressure from competing financial institutions 
the dramatically increased cost of deposits caused intense margin compression during late and the first two quarters of as management shifted liability strategies  high cost time deposits left the bank for higher rates elsewhere and were replaced with lower cost core deposit accounts 
now checking accounts were featured in the bank s marketing campaigns  resulting in an increase of million  or  in now account balances between june  and december  at december  dda  now  money market and savings account balances totaled of the bank s deposits compared to at december  increase noninterest income while the bank s primary source of revenue is net interest income  management is also actively searching for opportunities to diversify revenues through the growth in fee income which will provide additional value to our clients 
we believe market conditions remain favorable to grow our existing investment services and mortgage banking activities through organic development and through acquisitions  to the extent that the business models fit with our vision and mission 
noninterest income declined million in to million compared to million in the decline in revenues excluding one time events was due primarily to reduced retail banking revenues  which was a result of industry wide trends that we believe are favorable to consumers as the banking industry implements improved consumer protection processes and policies 
the bank took steps to increase mortgage banking fees in through the acquisition on december  of the business operations of bradford mortgage company  an established community mortgage company operating principally in the piedmont triad region 
control noninterest expense we believe that the bank will emerge from the recession as a more disciplined and efficient business  with greater opportunities for long term success 
core to the execution of management s operating plan is the implementation of a disciplined cost management culture where that which is within our control is controlled 
while certain items such as fdic insurance costs have proven to be outside our control  the vast majority of noninterest related expenses are controllable 
a key element to changing the bank s cost management culture is the implementation of a line item accountable budget process 
our budgets are now built around a philosophy we termed as the cast philosophy  which is an acronym for conservative in forecasts and expectations  accountable on an account by account basis  specific to each individual in the organization so goals and budgets are understood  and timely  so that continued monitoring and adjustments can be made in an extraordinary demonstration of this philosophy  the bank lowered its noninterest expense by million compared to  excluding one time costs  such as the impairment of goodwill and losses on disposal of branch locations  and a million increase in the cost of fdic insurance 
we are pleased that our efficiency ratio declined from over early in to during the fourth quarter of the improvement in our efficiency ratio was due in large part to management s ability to focus the bank s attention 
table of contents on eliminating excess costs and inefficient products  services and delivery channels from legacy operations 
as we continue through we believe the improved cost management culture will significantly improve the organization s financial performance 
position the bank to fulfill its vision and mission we are keenly aware that the bank is a community bank 
we live in our communities  serve our communities and take deposits and lend them back to our communities 
our community bank model encourages growth in our communities 
it is unlike the business model of many large regional and national banks  which take wealth in deposits from our communities and redeploy this wealth as investments in large metropolitan areas 
in order to position our bank to fulfill its vision and mission  we must ensure the organization has the right products  people and delivery channels to be able to serve our communities in the manner that fulfills our vision and mission 
in the bank made a number of disciplined but difficult decisions  including a thorough assessment of branch locations 
the assessment targeted the elimination of waste  inefficiency and duplication throughout our franchise 
management developed a methodology that evaluated each location s pre tax contributions  age and state of the facility  ease of closure  market demographics and overall fit within our strategic plan 
when the assessment was completed  management announced that seven low performing branch offices would eventually be closed  and three new branch offices would be added to support current and future customers 
the first of these new branches was opened in downtown greensboro late in finally  capital planning has remained paramount in this environment 
despite a challenging year  during which reserves grew and loans were charged off  bancorp s capital levels remain well above the regulatory levels required to be considered well capitalized 
at december  bancorp s total risk based capital was  well above the minimum well capitalized level of 
financial condition at december  and bancorp s consolidated assets of billion at year end reflects a decrease of from year end  following an increase of during the previous year 
the decrease from year end to year end is primarily a result of a decline in bancorp s loan portfolio  while the increase from year end to year end was primarily due to loan growth  partially offset by the write off of goodwill 
total average assets decreased from billion in  to billion in  while average earning assets increased  from billion in  to billion in the decrease in total average assets was also primarily the result of a decrease in loans outstanding  while the slight increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase in interest bearing bank balances 
gross loans decreased million during  or  compared to increases of in and in the decrease in loans is due primarily to principal repayment on existing loans coupled with soft loan demand in the current economic down turn 
loans secured by real estate totaled billion in and represented of total loans  compared with at year end within this category  residential real estate loans decreased to million and construction loans decreased to million 
commercial loans totaled million at year end  a decrease of from the end of consumer loans decreased during  ending the year at million 
management believes the bank is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers concentrated in a particular industry  the loss of whose deposits or whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect on operations 
investment securities at amortized cost totaled million at year end  a increase from million at year end us government agency securities totaled million  or of the portfolio at year end  compared to million  or of the portfolio one year earlier 
management believes that the additional risk of owning agency securities over us treasury securities is negligible and has capitalized on the favorable spreads available on the former 
mortgage backed securities totaled million  or of the portfolio  at december   compared to million  or of the portfolio at the previous year end 
state and municipal obligations amounted to million at year end  and comprised of the portfolio  compared to million  or of the portfolio a year earlier 
during  the company also 
table of contents began investing in corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
corporate bonds totaled million  or of the portfolio  of which million were covered bonds  while cmos totaled million  or of the portfolio 
the company s investment strategy is to achieve acceptable total returns through investments in securities with varying maturity dates  cash flows and yield characteristics 
us government agency securities are generally purchased for liquidity and collateral purposes  mortgage backed securities are purchased for yield and cash flow purposes  and longer maturity municipal bonds are purchased for yield and income generation 
the company categorizes the majority of its investment portfolio as available for sale  while a small portion is categorized as held to maturity 
the table  investment securities  presents the composition of the securities portfolio for the last three years  as well as information about cost  fair value and weighted average yield 
the competition for deposits within the bank s market areas increased significantly during as larger national and regional banks increased their rates in an effort to attract deposits and maintain adequate liquidity 
the bank  which historically has relied on appropriate pricing and high quality customer service to retain and increase its retail deposit base  was forced to compete with higher rates offered by the larger national and regional banks in order to satisfy its deposit requirements 
during  the company shifted its liability strategy  reducing its dependence on high cost time deposits in favor of lower cost core accounts  including dda  now checking  money market and savings accounts 
total deposits decreased million to billion at december   a decrease from a total of billion one year earlier 
this change was the result of a reduction in time deposits  as the interest rates offered by the bank declined substantially during the year 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in money market deposits  as the bank s new fastforward checking product  introduced in the third quarter of  grew to million at december  in order to attract additional deposits when necessary  the bank uses several different sources such as membership in an electronic deposit gathering network that allows it to post interest rates and attract deposits from across the us bulletin board deposits  brokered certificates of deposit secured through broker dealer partnerships and deposits obtained through the promontory interfinancial network  also known as cdars 
the bank s reliance on bulletin board deposits has continued to decrease during brokered deposits decreased from million at year end to million at year end  while cdars has increased from million at year end to million at year end the bank also has a credit facility available with the fhlb of atlanta 
the bank utilized a portion of the approximately million credit line with the fhlb of atlanta to fund earning assets 
fhlb borrowings totaled million at year end in addition to the credit line at the fhlb  the bank has borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank totaling million  of which there was million outstanding at december  management believes these credit lines are a cost effective and prudent alternative to deposit balances  since particular amounts  terms and structures may be selected to meet current needs 
financial condition at december  and as discussed in item business general  bancorp was created as a result of the merger of lsb and fnb  effective july  when reading the following discussion of financial condition at december  and  note that bancorp s results of operations for the full year do not include the operating results for fnb prior to july  bancorp s consolidated assets of billion at year end reflect an increase of over year end the increase from year end to year end is primarily a result of growth in bancorp s loan portfolio  partially offset by the write off of goodwill 
total average assets increased from billion in  to billion in during  bancorp experienced a increase in average earning assets  as average earning assets totaled billion in  compared to billion in the increases in total average assets and average earning assets were primarily attributable to the merger  as the assets of the former fnb are only included for five months of

this change was the result of increased time deposits  partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and money market deposits 
net interest income like most financial institutions  the primary component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investments  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
spread and margin are influenced by the levels and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as by levels of noninterest bearing liabilities 
average balances and net interest income analysis 
the accompanying table sets forth  for the years through  information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  resultant yields or rates  net interest income  net interest spread  net interest margin and ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities

liquidity and cash flow market and public confidence in our financial strength and in the strength of financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital resources 
liquidity management refers to the policies and practices that ensure the bank has the ability to meet day to day cash flow requirements based primarily on activity in loan and deposit accounts of the bank s customers 
management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of  and demands for  funds on a daily and other periodic bases 
deposit withdrawals  loan funding and general corporate activity create the primary needs for liquidity for the bank 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  investments available for sale  loan repayments  loan sales  increases in deposits  and increases in borrowings from the fhlb secured with pledged loans and securities  and from correspondent banks under overnight federal funds credit lines and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
bancorp has sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  to provide for bancorp s obligations and service its debt for approximately three years 
the investment portfolio at december  included securities with a par value of approximately million with call features  whereby the issuers of such securities have the option to repay the security before the contractual maturity date 
bancorp anticipates that a number of these debt instruments may be called by their issuers during  due to the continued low interest rates available for short term debt issuance 
the bank has the ability to manage  within competitive and cost of funds constraints  increases in deposits within its market areas 
the bank is a member of an electronic network that allows it to post interest rates and attract certificates of deposit nationally 
it also utilizes cdars and brokered deposits to supplement in market deposit growth 

table of contents the bank has established wholesale repurchase agreements with regional brokerage firms 
the bank can access this additional source of liquidity by pledging investment securities with the brokerage firms 
liquidity is further enhanced by a line of credit with the fhlb  amounting to approximately million  collateralized by fhlb stock  investment securities  qualifying to family residential mortgage loans  and qualifying commercial real estate loans 
based upon collateral pledged  as of december   the borrowing capacity under this line was million  with million available to be borrowed 
the bank provides various reports to the fhlb on a regular basis to maintain the availability of the credit line 
each borrowing request to the fhlb is initiated through an advance application that is subject to approval by the fhlb before funds are advanced under the line of credit

cash flows for included an inflow of million related to a decrease in the loan portfolio  compared to cash outflows of million in as the loan portfolio increased 
the increase in cash used in compared to was primarily a result of an increase in loans made to customers  partially offset by net proceeds from maturities of available for sale securities

the increase in cash provided from to is primarily the result of the proceeds from issuance of preferred stock and warrants

the bank expects that the majority of its new construction and development loans on commercial and residential projects will be in the range of  to million 
at december  and  the bank held million and million of such loans 
to reduce credit risk associated with such loans  the bank emphasizes small commercial centers that are substantially preleased  or residential projects that are substantially presold and built in strong  proven markets 
the leases on commercial projects must generally result in a loan to appraised value of to or less and a net cash flow to debt service at no less than to 
the bank typically requires a personal guarantee from the developer or builder 
loan terms are generally months  although the bank occasionally will make a mini permanent loan for purposes of construction and development of up to a five year term

loan approval and review 
when the aggregate outstanding loans to a single borrower or related entities exceed an individual officer s lending authority  the loan request must be considered and approved by an officer with a higher lending limit 
all consumer purpose loan decisions are made by the bank s central underwriting support group 
area executives can generally approve commercial relationships up to  if the lending request exceeds the area executive s lending limit  the loan must be submitted to and approved by a senior credit officer

loan relationships over  must be approved by the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
the bank s loan review program is headed by the loan review manager  who reports directly to the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
the program includes the annual loan review coverage plan which is approved by the credit management committee and which stipulates a certain number of loan reviews to be completed by the loan review manager and employees under his or her guidance  and an additional number of loan reviews to be completed by independent loan review consulting firms 
in addition  all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing their portfolios and making adjustments to the risk ratings as needed 
the watch loan committee  which includes the cco  the special assets manager and the special assets officers  reviews all loans graded special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss on a monthly basis  and this meeting is observed by the loan review manager and summarized for the credit management committee  also on a monthly basis 
the bank s credit review system supplements its loan rating system  pursuant to which the bank may place a loan on its criticized asset list or may classify a loan in one of various other classification categories 
a specified minimum percentage of loans in each adverse asset classification category  based on the historical loss experience of the bank in each such category  are used to determine the adequacy of the bank s allowance for credit losses monthly 
these loans are also individually reviewed by the watch loan committee of the bank to determine whether a greater allowance allocation is justified due to the facts and circumstances of a particular adversely classified loan 
the bank s loan portfolio is analyzed on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group

see lending activities loan approval and review 
it is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is the lending officer s responsibility to recommend appropriate changes in the borrower s risk grade 
currently  the grading process utilized by the bank is segmented by product type 
this methodology does not provide a direct correlation with groupings utilized in the other tables presenting loan information 
the bank s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the bank s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are generally viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the bank s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the bank s credit policies and procedures

the entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category 
the allocation is not necessarily indicative of future losses 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity have a lower risk profile than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less 
table of contents risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  because the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
the bank has little or no exposure to subprime lending 
consumer loans  which are smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the bank s entire primary market areas  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the bank s lowest risk profile loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans because home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decision making process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
the consumer real estate appraisal process is also centralized relative to appraisal engagement  appraisal review  and appraiser quality assessment 
these processes are detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
management follows a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in its loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  the bank maintains an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
the function of determining the allowance for credit losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for credit losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to a review of individual loans  historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral and economic conditions in the bank s market areas 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
loans are charged off when in the opinion of management  they are deemed to be uncollectible 
recognized losses are charged against the allowance  and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
management believes the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio  however  assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires continuous evaluation and considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that credit losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting future operating results of the bank

all commercial loans within the portfolio are risk graded among nine risk grades based on management s evaluation of the overall credit quality of the loan  including the payment history  the financial position of the borrower  the underlying collateral value  an internal credit risk assessment and examination results 
there is an increased reserve percentage for each successively higher risk grade 
as a result  the allowance is adjusted upon any migration of a loan to a higher risk grade within the commercial loan portfolio 
the reserve percentages utilized have been determined by management to be appropriate based on historical loan loss levels and the risk for each corresponding risk grade 
following the merger  the bank elected to adjust the reserve percentage for certain risk grades  based on its analysis of the history of the combined loan portfolio and the associated chargeoffs  as well as current economic conditions 
based on these revisions  approximately million was added to the allowance for credit losses at the end of the bank had of its total commercial loans in risk grades that are deemed acceptable or better at year end  compared to at year end mortgage  home equity  and credit lines 
reserves are calculated on mortgage  home equity  and credit lines based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for each of these loan categories 
the reserve requirement also includes a reserve percentage for current economic conditions 
the sum of these two components is applied to the dollar balance of loans in each of these categories to determine the required reserve 
retail loans 
the retail loans are pooled together to determine the reserve requirement 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for this loan category 
the reserve requirement also includes a reserve percentage for current economic conditions 
the sum of these two components is applied to the dollar balance of retail loans to determine the required reserve for current loans and loans past due less than days 
a separate reserve is calculated for loans past due days or more 
a reserve amount equal to of all retail 
table of contents loans past due days or more is added to the above mentioned requirement to determine the total reserve requirement for retail loans 
specific impairment 
management evaluates significant loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss on an individual basis for impairment 
the specific allowance is calculated based upon a review of these loans and the estimated losses at the balance sheet date 
at december  and  the recorded investment in significant loans considered impaired was approximately million and million  respectively and the specific allowance for credit losses associated with those loans was approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the amount of significant impaired loans held by the bank and the associated allowance for credit losses resulted  primary  from the bank s decision to take appropriate aggressive action with our problem credits through chargeoffs and foreclosure 
watch list review 
specific allowances may be determined based on a review of specific watch list loans 
specific losses are estimated at each measurement date 
the bank has established a watch list committee to review all loans placed on the watch list 
the watch list primarily consists of loans classified as special mention  substandard and doubtful 
an action plan is established for each watch list loan 
by reviewing these watch list loans  the bank is able to update original probable loss amounts in light of developing conditions 
this serves to reduce the differences between estimated and actual observed losses 
during  the bank continued to focus on reviewing its loan portfolio and reclassifying its loans  as required 
watch list loans increased to million at year end  from million at year end the reserve requirement for watch list loans totaled million and million for and  respectively

the allowance for credit losses  which is utilized to absorb actual losses in the loan portfolio  is maintained at a level consistent with management s best estimate of probable credit losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines 
management also analyzes the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is considered to be the bank s interest rate risk which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
the bank is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk 
interest rate risk on our balance sheet arises from the maturity mismatch of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities  as well as the potential for maturities to shorten or lengthen our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents the company uses several interest rate risk measurement tools provided by a national asset liability management consultant to help manage this risk 
management provides key assumptions to the consultant  which are used as inputs into the measurement tools 
following is a summary of two different tools management uses on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
earnings simulation modeling 
net income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve and the general market pressures affecting current market interest rates at the time of simulation 
many interest rate indices do not move uniformly  creating certain disunities between them 
for example  the spread between a day  prime based asset and a day  fhlb advance may not be uniform over time 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income caused by the effect of changes in interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
simulation results are measured as a percentage change in net interest income compared to the static rate or base case scenario 
the model considers increases and decreases in asset and liability volumes using prepayment assumptions as well as rate changes 
rate changes are modeled gradually over a month period  referred to as a rate ramp 
the model projects only changes in interest income and expense and does not project changes in non interest income  non interest expense  provision for loan losses or the impact of changing tax rates 
at december   net interest income simulation showed a negative change from the base case in a basis point ramped rising rate environment and a positive change from the base case in a basis point ramped declining rate environment 
the projected decrease in net interest income is within the asset liability committee s guidelines in a basis point increasing or basis point decreasing interest rate environment 
however  management continually monitors signs of elevated risks and takes certain actions to limit these risks 
the following table summarizes the results of the company s income simulation model as of december  change in net interest income year year change in market interest rates basis point ramped increase base case no change basis point ramped decrease net portfolio value analysis 
net portfolio value npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any actions management might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
the following is a summary of the results of the report compiled by the company s outside consultant using data and assumptions management provided as of december  estimated change in net portfolio value amount in s percent change in market interest rates basis point increase base case no change basis point decrease the preceding table indicates that  at december   in the event of a basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates  npv would be expected to decrease by million  or of the base case scenario value of million

table of contents interest rate risk management is a part of the bank s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the bank s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of the bank s ceo  chief financial officer cfo  cco  investment officer  chief risk officer and other senior executives 
the committee meets on a monthly basis to review the asset liability management activities of the bank and monitor compliance with established policies 
activities of the asset and liability committee are reported to the audit and risk management committee of the company s board of directors 
a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the bank s primary earnings component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the bank s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment may have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates that are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income

the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between repricing assets and repricing liabilities for a particular time period 
the table  interest sensitivity analysis  indicates a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within one year at december   to be x 
this ratio indicates that a larger balance of liabilities  compared to assets  could potentially reprice during the upcoming month period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts now  mmi  and savings that are subject to 
table of contents immediate withdrawal and repricing 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
the overall risk to net interest income is also influenced by the bank s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an interest rate index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying interest rate index 
approximately of the total loan portfolio has a variable interest rate and reprices in accordance with the underlying rate index subject to terms of individual note agreements 
in addition to the traditional gap analysis  the bank also utilizes a computer based interest rate risk simulation model prepared by an independent consultant 
this comprehensive model includes rate sensitivity gap analysis  net interest income analysis  and present value of equity analysis  under various rate scenarios 
the bank uses this model to monitor interest rate risk on a quarterly basis and to detect trends that may affect the overall net interest income of the bank 
this simulation incorporates the dynamics of balance sheet and interest rate changes and calculates the related effect on net interest income 
as a result  management believes that this analysis more accurately projects the risk to net interest income over the upcoming month period 
the bank s asset liability policy provides guidance for levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations  if necessary  to mitigate excessive levels of risk 
the modeling results indicate the bank is subject to an acceptable level of interest rate risk
