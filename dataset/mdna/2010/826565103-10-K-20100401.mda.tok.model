item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
except for historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of and section e of the securities exchange act of overview we are a leading fabless provider of highly integrated soc solutions that are used to deliver multimedia entertainment throughout the home 
we currently offer four separate product lines media processors  home networking solutions  video image processors and home automation solutions 
each of these product lines also contributes to our fully integrated soc offerings 
we sell our products into four primary markets  which are the iptv market  the connected home technologies market  the connected media player market and the prosumer and industrial audio video market 
we also sell our products  to a lesser extent  into several other markets  such as the hdtv and pc based add in markets  which we refer to collectively as our other market 
our primary target markets are iptv  connected home technologies  connected media player  and prosumer and industrial audio video 
the iptv set top box market consists of consumer and commercial products that distribute and receive streaming video using ip 
the connected home technologies market is served by our home networking and home automation product lines 
our home networking products are used in iptv set top boxes as well as residential gateways  optical network terminals  multi dwelling unit masters and network adapters 
our home automation products are used in a wide variety of home control products such as thermostats  light switches and door locks 
our uwb products target hdav  speaker and home networking solutions over coax and wireless 
t he connected media player market consists primarily of digital media adapters  portable media devices and blu ray dvd players that perform playback of digital media stored in optical or hard disk formats 
the prosumer and industrial audio video market consists of studio quality audio video receivers and monitors  digital projectors and medical video monitors 
we also sell products into other markets such as the hdtv  pc based add in and connectivity markets 
we derive minor net revenue from sales of our products into these other markets 
we target the connected home technologies market with our coppergate  z wave and uwb products 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue from our uwb products 
we believe we are the leading provider of digital media processor socs as well as home network chipsets for set top boxes in the iptv market in terms of units shipped 
our products are used by leading iptv set top box providers  such as cisco systems scientific atlanta  motorola  netgem and utstarcom 
iptv set top boxes incorporating our chipsets are deployed by telecommunications carriers globally including carriers in asia  europe and north america such as at t  deutsche telekom and freebox 
we work with these carriers and set top box providers as well as with systems software providers  such as microsoft  to design solutions that address the carriers specific requirements regarding features and performance 
our media processor socs are also used by consumer electronics providers  such as netgear  sharp  sony and western digital in applications such as dmas  blu ray dvd players  hdtvs and other connected media player devices 
our coppergate products are used by leading iptv set top box and residential gateway providers  such as wire  cisco systems scientific atlanta and motorola 
these solutions are deployed by telecommunications carriers globally  but primarily in north america  such as at t  telus and bell aliant 
our vxp video image processor products are one of the leading solutions for studio quality video image processing and are used by leading industry participants such as polycom  sony  harris and panasonic 
our z wave home automation products are used by le ading industry participants such as danfoss  ingersoll rand schlage  leviton and trane 
for both fiscal and  we derived  of our net revenue from our soc solutions 
our soc solutions consist of highly integrated semiconductors and software that process digital video and audio content 
our net revenue from sales of our soc solutions decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in our socs sales in fiscal was in part attributable to the overall slowdown in the iptv market as a result of macroeconomic conditions  partially offset by the acquisition of coppergate 
we do not enter into long term commitment contracts with our customers and receive substantially all of our net revenue based on purchase orders 
we forecast demand for our products based not only on our assessment of the requirements of our direct customers  but also on the anticipated requirements of the telecommunications carriers that our customers serve 
we work with both our direct customers and these carriers to address the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies 
however  our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers or lead to excess inventory  which could negatively impact our gross margins in a particular period 
many of our target markets are characterized by intense price competition 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and  as a result  we expect our average selling prices to decline over time 
however  on occasion  we have reduced our prices for individual customer volume orders as part of our strategy to obtain a competitive position in our target markets 
the willingness of customers to design our socs into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset any declines in product selling prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross m argins 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in our average selling prices  volume order discounts  mix of product sales  our costs  the extent of development fees and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from three principal sources product sales and  to a lesser extent  product development contracts and service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue for product sales and service contracts in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standard codification  or asc  revenue recognition formerly staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 revenue recognition  under which revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed or deter minable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  as shipping terms are predominantly fob shipping point  except that revenue is deferred when we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectability is not assured 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable 
allowances for sales returns  discounts and warranty costs are recorded at the time that the associated revenue is recognized 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development  or ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer relationships  developed technology  ipr d and trademarks 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired products  customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
the estimated fair values are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
purchased intangible assets wit h finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment under asc  property  plant  and equipment formerly sfas  accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and forecasted operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ f rom those estimates 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under an asset and liability approach in accordance with asc  income taxes formerly statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes  and any operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for future taxable amounts and deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions  net of any valuation allowance  to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are considered more likely than not to be realized 
under asc  income taxes formerly fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income tax  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  asc provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product 
a provision is recorded for inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
in addition  we will write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life c ycles 
increases to the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenue 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower costed inventory is subsequently sold  the related allowance is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
share based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment  we determine the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant utilizing an option pricing model  which is impacted by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors expected period bet ween stock option vesting date and stock option exercise date 
option pricing models have been developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  in our opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with asc using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities include ars  corporate bonds and us agency notes 
we classify our marketable securities as available for sale and report them at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we monitor all our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have a decline in fair value  use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration o f any impairment  iii the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
at january   we held nine auction rate securities with an adjusted cost and par value of million 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
historically  the fair value of our ars has been determined by the frequent auction periods  generally every days  which provided liquidity at par value for these investments 
however  subsequent to february  all auctions involving such securities held by us have failed 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will continue to be limited until there is a successful auction  the is suer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for these ars develop 
we cannot be certain regarding the amount of time it will take for an auction market or other markets to develop for these securities 
in october  our cash investment advisor  ubs  acknowledged our acceptance of its proposal of a comprehensive settlement agreement  in which all the ars currently in our portfolio could be redeemed at par value 
the offer to redeem will be at our option during a two year period beginning in june the offer also gives ubs the discretion to buy any or all of these securities from us at par value at any time 
additionally  the proposed solution by ubs to the lack of liquidity of our ars included a commitment effective october through june to loan an amount up to of the par value of the ars 
the interest charged on such loan would be equal to the proportional amount of interest being paid by the issuers of the ars borrowed against 
at january   ubs provided an estimated value for the nine ars of approximately million  which reflects an unrealized loss of million from our original purchase price 
we have not adopted ubs estimated value of our ars for the reasons described below 
we have reviewed the prospectuses for each of the nine ars in our investment portfolio as of january  and determined that the unprecedented disruption in the auction process and resulting pattern of interest payments was in accordance with their established rules of operation under these circumstances 
the default mechanism called for in the operating rules of these instruments is designed to adjust their interest payments to a limit based on the income generated by their underlying student loans 
the most significant consequences of this mechanism are the preservation of their aaa credit rating while adjusting to a continuing stream of interest payments to the security holders at a rate correlating to contemporary credit market rates 
as a result of this review  we reached the conclusion that the securities do have a strong underlying principle value and that any potential adjustment in their carrying value would be based upon our ability to endure their lack of liquidity  the degree of certainty of continuing interest payments and the rate of return on these securities 
given that we expect considerable liquidity from our other assets  foresee continuing positive cash flow and have accepted our investment advisor s offer to purchase all of our ars at par value in june  we do not consider the remaining possible liquidity risk and ubs default risk to be significant enough to justify a reduction in the carrying value 
the remaining valuation factor that we considered was the rate of return evidenced by the interest received 
we used a discounted cash flow calculation that reached a valuation that was similar to other of our recent investments with comparably high credit ratings 
as a result of this judgment process and in accordance with the various accounting pronouncements in this area  we reached the conclusion that the carrying value of our ars has not been impaired and that we have no expectation of any material adverse impact on our future results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources associated with holding these securities 
at january   all of our ars are classified as short term marketable securities and as level assets in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurements  as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
if different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation approach including  but not limited to  assumptions involving the estimated lives of the ars  the estimated cash flows over those estimated lives  and the estimated discount rates  applied to those cash flows  the estimated fair va lue of these investments could be significantly lower than the fair value we determined as of january  litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
if any of these events were to happen  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional expense 
accounts receivable we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot estimate whether collectability is reasonably assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we also provide allowances for bad debt and sales returns 
in establishing our allowance for bad debt we review the customer s payment history and information regarding their credit worthiness 
in establishing our allowance for sales returns  we make estimates of potential future returns of products for which revenue has been recognized in the current period  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
 in fiscal  and  we recorded provisions for sales returns  discounts and bad debt in the total amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or future product returns increased  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of operations and sets forth our historical operating results as a percentage of net revenue for each of the fiscal years indicated in thousands  except percentages years ended january  of january  of february  of net revenue net revenue net revenue net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquired in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income and other income  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income net revenue our net revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease in revenue for fiscal was primarily due to a decline in the average selling price of our socs which was partially offset by a increase in soc units shipped 
the decline in average selling prices  or asps was primarily the result of shipments to our larger customers  who achieved cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products as well as shipments of our coppergate and z wave products  which we added to our product line in the fiscal fourth quarters of and  respectively  and which have lower asps than our media processor and vxp products 
the increase in soc units shipped was primarily due to higher units shipped for our connected home technolog ies products as a result of our coppergate and zensys acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  our connected media player products 
our net revenue for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease in revenue for fiscal was primarily due to an approximate decline in average selling prices of our socs which was partially offset by an increase in soc units shipped 
the decline in average selling prices was primarily the result of certain customers achieving cumulative volume sales targets during the year on purchases of our mature smp series soc products 
this decline in average selling prices was not offset by the increase in soc units shipped during fiscal compared to fiscal due to a reduction in inventory levels in our customers supply chains 
net revenue by target market we sell our products into four primary target markets  which are the iptv market  the connected media player market  the prosumer and industrial audio video market and the connected home technologies market 
we also sell our products  to a lesser extent  into several other markets  such as the hdtv and pc based add in markets  which we refer to collectively as our other market 
we expect net revenue from sales into the connected home technologies market to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenue in future periods as we begin to sell new products acquired in connection with the acquisition of coppergate into this target market 
the following table sets forth our net revenue by target market and the percentage of net revenue represented by our product sa les to each target market in thousands  except percentages years ended january  of january  of february  of net revenue net revenue net revenue iptv connected media players prosumer and industrial audio video connected home technologies other net revenue the percentage of net revenue is less than one percent 
iptv for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our soc solutions  primarily our smp soc series  into the iptv market decreased million  or  from fiscal this decline was attributable to certain factors affecting the iptv demand including weakness in our iptv market that we have experienced since the beginning of the second half of fiscal as a result of the general economic downturn and the impact of declining average selling prices due to certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products 
our revenue from the iptv market as a percentage of our total net revenue decreased by for fisc al compared to fiscal as a result of these factors and also due to the increase in net revenue for our connected media player and connected home technologies markets 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our soc solutions  primarily our smp soc series  into the iptv market increased million  or  from fiscal the relatively flat growth in was attributable to an overall slowdown in the iptv market in the second half of fiscal as a result of the economic downturn and adjustments to inventory levels at our customers and throughout the supply chain 
our revenue from the iptv market increased by as a percentage of our total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in socs shipped to our customers in the connected media player market during the same period 
we expect our revenue from the iptv market to fluctuate in future periods as this revenue is based on iptv service deploy ments by telecommunication service providers  changes in inventory levels at the contract manufacturers that supply them and competitive market pressures 
connected media player for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products to the connected media players market increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of our socs to customers who incorporate our socs into digital media adapters 
for the same reason  our revenue from the connected media players market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products to the connected media player market decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales to customers who incorporate our socs into blu ray players as a result of increased competition 
for the same reason  our percentage of net revenue from sales into the connected media player market decreased as a percentage of our total revenue during the same period 
prosumer and industrial audio video for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market decreased million  or  from fiscal the decline was attributable to an overall slowdown in the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a result of the global economic downturn 
our revenue from sales into the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a percentage of total net revenue was unchanged for fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market was million 
we en tered into this market through our acquisition of the vxp group in february connected home technologies prior to the second quarter of fiscal  we referred to our connected home technologies target market as our wireless market 
we believe the connected home technologies market that we currently address with our coppergate  uwb and z wave product lines more accurately describes our target market 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into our connected home technologies market increased million compared to fiscal this increase was the result of our acquisition of coppergate in november and zensys holdings corporation in december for the same reason  our percenta ge of net revenue from sales into the connected home technologies market increased to as a percentage of our total net revenue 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the connected home technologies market increased by million  or  from fiscal this increase was the result of our entry into the connected home technologies market through our acquisition of zensys holdings corporation in december we expect our net revenue from this market to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue as we expand sales of our z wave product line and add sales from our coppergate product line 
other our other markets consist of hdtv  pc add in boards  development kits  development contracts  services and other ancillary markets 
for fiscal  net revenue from this market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower engineering development fees for customization of our socs and a decline in sales of our socs to customers who incorporate our products into hdtvs 
for fiscal  other revenue decreased by million primarily attributable to a decline in sales of our socs to customers who incorporate our product in the hdtv market as a result of increased competition 
net revenue by product group our primary product group consists of our soc solutions 
to a lesser extent we derive net revenue from other products and services 
the following table sets forth net revenue in each of our product groups and the percentage of net revenue represented by each product group in thousands  except percentages years ended january  of net january  of net february  of net revenue revenue revenue socs other net revenue socs our socs are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume designer and manufacturer customers building products for our iptv  connected media player  prosumer and industrial audio video and connected home technologies consumer electronic markets 
the decrease of million  or  in net revenue from socs for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decline in average selling price of our socs which was partially offset by a increase in soc units shipped 
the decline in average selling prices was primarily the result of shipments to our larger customers  who achieved cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products as well as sales of our coppergate and z wave products which we added to our product line in the fiscal fourth quarters of and  respectively  which have lower average selling prices than our media processor products 
the increase in soc units shipped was primarily due to higher units volume shipped for our connected home technologies products as a result of our coppergate and zensys acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  our connected media player products 
the decrease of million  or  in net revenue from socs in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to an approximate decline in average selling prices of our socs which was partially offset by an increase of soc units shipped 
the decline in average selling prices was primarily the result of certain customers achieving cumulative volume sales targets during the year on purchases of our mature soc products 
this decline in average selling prices was not offset by the increase in soc units shipped during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a reduction in inventory levels in our customers supply chains 
other we derive revenue from other products and services  including engineering support services for hardware and software  engineering development for customization of socs and other accessories 
the decrease in our net revenue from other products of million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in nonrecurring engineering fees 
the decrease of million  or  in our net revenue from other products in fiscal from fiscal was due to a reduction in engineering development and service fees and sales of development kits 
we anticipate our net revenue from board products will be relative ly flat or decrease in future periods due to our strategic decision to focus on our soc solutions 
net revenue by geographic region the following table sets forth our net revenue by geographic region and the percentage of net revenue represented by each geographic region based on the invoicing location of each customer in thousands  except percentages years ended january  of january  of february  of net revenue net revenue net revenue asia europe north america other regions net revenue the percentage of net revenue is less than one percent 
asia our net revenue in absolute dollars from asia increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue from asia increased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue from asia in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from customers in taiwan and china which was primarily attributable to a significant customer shifting its production orders from a contract manufacturer located in europe to contract manufacturers in those countries 
in addition  net rev enue from taiwan increased due to a customer ramping production of their dma product 
this increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue was partially offset by a decline in the average selling prices of our socs 
our net revenue in absolute dollars from asia decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in net revenue from asia in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues from customers in japan and korea due to unit volume decline in blu ray dvd players and in singapore due to a reduction in inventory levels in our customers in the supply chain related to iptv during fiscal the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenue from countries in the asia region that accounted for over of net revenue years ended january  january  february  taiwan china singapore korea japan net revenue from this country was less than of our net revenue 
europe our net revenue in absolute dollars from europe for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal our net revenue from europe decreased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in our net revenue from europe in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue was primarily attributable to an iptv customer who incorporates our products into their finished goods moving their production orders to contract manufacturers located in asia starting in the third quarter of fiscal and also due to iptv customers whose demand declined due to continued weakness in the iptv market that we have experienced since the b eginning of the second half of fiscal as a result of the general economic downturn and the impact of declining average selling prices due to certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products 
our net revenue in absolute dollars from europe for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase in our net revenue from europe in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to major deployments by our european customers in france using our socs in their iptv set top boxes 
our net revenue from europe in any given period fluctuates depending on whether our customers place their orders locally or through their overseas manufacturers who incorporate our socs into their final products 
the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenue from countries in the europe region that accounted for or more of net revenue years ended january  january  february  france netherlands net revenue from this country was less than of our net revenue 
north america our net revenue in absolute dollars from north america decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue from north america decreased as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in our net revenue from north america in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to customers who incorporate our products into their finished goods placing their orders through contract manufacturers located outside of north america 
our net revenue in absolute dollars from north america increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue from north america increased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in our net revenue from north america in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased demand for our soc solutions for the prosumer and industrial audio video markets as a result of our acquisition of the vxp product line in february however  the overall trend has been for companies located in north america who incorporate our products into their finished products to move their production orders to large designers and manufacturers located in the asia region 
our revenue from north america in any given period fluctuates depending on whether our customers place their orders locally or through overseas manufacturers who incorporate our products into their final products 
in fiscal  our net revenue generated outside north america was of our net revenue compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we expect that net revenue outside of north america will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue 
major customers the following table sets forth the major customers that accounted for over of net revenue years ended january  january  february  customer motorola gemtek cisco systems uniquest corp

gross profit and gross margin the following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin in thousands years ended january  january  february  change change gross profit gross margin the million decrease in gross profit  or percentage point decrease in gross margin  for fiscal compared to fiscal  was due primarily to a decline in our average selling prices per soc which was partially offset by a decline in our average costs per soc unit 
the decline in average selling prices was primarily the result of certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products and the addition of products with lower asps in our z wave and coppergate product lines 
the decline in our average cost per soc unit was primarily due to overall cost reductions from our suppliers as well as improved yields on our highest volume products 
the decline in our average cost was partially offset by operations overhead increasing by million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in amortization of acquired intangibles and million increase in compensation and benefits costs due to our acquisitions of coppergate and zensys in november and december  respectively 
additionally  our gross margin in fiscal was lower compared to fiscal due to an increase of million in connection with mark up on inventories purchased through our acquisitions of coppergate and zensys 
the million decrease in gross profit  or percentage point decrease in gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal  was due primarily to the decrease in revenues as well as a decline in our average selling prices per soc unit which was only partially offset by a decline in our average costs per soc unit 
our average cost per unit did not decline as fast as our average selling prices due to a buildup of more expensive wafers in our die bank in the second quarter of fiscal that was not consumed as demand decreased due to a reduction in inventory levels in our customer s supply chain

rent and facilities costs increased million primarily as a result of additional facilities in israel 
research and development expense increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefit expense due to an increase in headcount and salaries  an increase of million in share based compensation expense due to an increase in headcount  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization due to purchases of equipment and design tool software  an increase of million in rent and facilities costs as a result of new facilities in france and canada  an increase of million in travel and tradeshow costs to provide engineering support to marketing efforts  and an increase of million in recruiting fees in support of hiring additional personnel  which was partially o ffset by a million decrease in development and design costs due to lower software support and maintenance

sales and marketing expense increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefit expenses which was primarily due to higher headcount from acquisitions of vxp and zensys  an increase of million in share based compensation expense which was primarily due to million in acceleration of vesting of certain option grants and new grants for new hires  an increase of million in tradeshow costs to promote our products and a million increase in amortization of acquired intangibles as result of the vxp and zensys acquisitions 
we anticipate that our sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars

these increases were partially offs et by a decrease of million in legal fees  which was higher in fiscal primarily due to the review of our historical stock option granting practices 
we expect our general and administrative expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  totaled million in fiscal as a result of the vxp group acquisition completed in february the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d was determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and was expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future use existed

the amount of unearned share based compensation currently estimated to be expensed in the period fiscal through related to unvested share based payment awards at january  is million 
the weighted average period over which the unearned share based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
the decrease in share based compensation expense for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal for an option granted and fully vested during that period and a million reduction due to a specific option cancellation recorded in the first quarter of fiscal future share based compensation expense and unearned share based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with any acquisitions 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense of million  million and million for acquired developed technology for fiscal  and  respectively  is classified as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
amortization expense of  million and million for acquired noncompete agreements for fiscal  and  respectively  is classified as research and development expense 
amortization expense of million and million for acquired trademarks and customer relationships for fiscal and is classified as sales and marketing expense 
no amortization expense was classified as sales and marketing expense for fiscal at january   the unamortized balance from purchased intangible assets was million whi ch will be amortized in future periods based on their respective remaining estimated useful lives 
if we purchase additional intangible assets in the future  our cost of revenue or other operating expenses will increase by the amortization of those assets 
acquired intangible assets  subject to amortization  were as follows as of january  in thousands  except for years gross value accumulated amortization net value weighted average remaining amortization period years developed technology trademarks noncompete agreements customer relationships in process research and development we acquired ipr d of million in our acquisition of coppergate 
the fair value of the ipr d was determined through estimates and valuation techniques based on the terms and details of the acquisition 
the amounts allocated to ipr d will not begin to be expensed until completion of the related project  as it was determined that the underlying project had not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition 
the ipr d project represents our next generation homepna product with backward compatibility to our current homepna and homeplug av products and provides increased data rates  ease of use and quality of service  or qos 
upon completion of development  the acquired ipr d will be amortized over its useful life 
interest and other income  net the following table sets forth our net interest and other income and related percentage change over the previous fiscal year for fiscal  and in thousands  except percentages years ended january  january  february  change change interest and other income  net our other income and expense primarily consisted of interest income from marketable securities  income from refundable research and development credits  gain or loss on foreign exchange transactions  gain or loss on sales of marketable securities and interest expense 
the decrease of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and a decrease in interest rates earned on our marketable securities portfolio 
our foreign exchange exposure  primarily in the canadian dollar  danish krone  israeli shekel and euro  has increased compared to fiscal as a result of our further expansion into international locations and significant volatility of the us dollar in relation to those currenc ies 
the decrease of million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in our average interest rate achieved on our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities which was partially offset by an increase in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million in fiscal and  respectively and a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal the fiscal  and effective tax rate was approximately  and  respectively 
our fiscal effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to our international operations strategy  which resulted in a foreign tax differential benefit and the offsetting effect of writing off the california deferred tax assets due to our assessment that it is not more likely than not to be realized in the future 
our fiscal effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to our international operations strategy  which resulted in a foreign tax d ifferential benefit 
our fiscal effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to our use of net operating losses and the release of the valuation allowance  which provided an aggregate tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities in thousands january  january  cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities as of january   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million  which represents an increase of million from million at january  the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities was primarily the result of million of cash generated from our operating activities  reclassification of million of our auction rate securities  or ars  from long term to short term marketable securities  million of net sales and maturities of marketable securities  million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock through our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan and million of redemptions of arss 
these inflows of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities were partially offset by million used for the acquisition of coppergate in november  million invested in a convertible note of a privately held technology company  purchases of million for software  equipment and leasehold improvements  million for purchases of long term investments in privately held technology companies and a million increase in restricted cash 
in october  we accepted an offer from our cash investment advisor  ubs  of a comprehensive settlement agreement  in which all the ars currently held in our ubs portfolio could be redeemed at par value 
the offer to redeem will be at our option during a two year period beginning in june as a result of this offer  we expect to sell all of our auction rate securities to ubs within six months from january  accordingly  we have classified our auction rate securities as short term marketable securities 
our primary net cash inflows and outflows for each fiscal year were as follows in thousands years ended january  january  february  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to net income of million  non cash expenses of million  a million decrease in inventories  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and a million increase in accounts payable 
these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accrued and other liabilities 
non cash expenses included in net income in fiscal consisted primarily of million in depreciation and amortization and million in share based compensation expense 
the decrease in inventories was the result of successful efforts to reduce the level of our die bank and a significant increase in demand in the fourth fiscal quarter of which resulted in an increase in our annualized rate of inventory turns to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payment for inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of increased billings due to increased product shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual average days sales outstanding improved to days at january  compared to days at january   primarily due to timing of shipments and customer mix 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal the cash provided by our operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to net income of million  non cash operating expenses of million  a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million increase in other long term liabilities and a million decrease in other assets 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a million increase in inventories 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due primarily to lower inventory purchases and the timing of payments for tax liabilities and software licenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower product revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventories resulted from an increase in our die bank level at the end of the fiscal compared to the end of fiscal at the end of fiscal  our die bank level was low relative to the sales volume we were experiencing at that time due to rapidly increasing demand during fiscal at the end of fiscal our die bank was somewhat elevated relative to our sales volume due to a strategic build up of certain wafers for some of our key customers 
the increase in other long term liabilities is primarily due to higher deferred tax obligations which resulted in increased long term income taxes payable and deferred tax liabilities 
non cash charges included share based compensation of million  depreciation and amortization of million  provisi on for sales returns  discounts and doubtful accounts of million  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and acquired in process research and development of million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal the cash provided by our operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to net income of million  non cash expenses of million and a million increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventories in were the result of the increase in our sales in the iptv  high definition dvd and other media players  and hdtv markets 
non cash charges included share based compensation of million in fiscal offset by a reduction of deferred income taxes of million 
cash flows from our operating activities will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow net revenues while managing the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us  the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal which was primarily due to net cash paid of million in connection with the acquisition of coppergate  purchases of software  equipment and leasehold improvements of million  an investment of million in a convertible note receivable of a privately held technology company  million of private equity investments and million of cash restricted for our foreign exchange hedging transactions 
these usages of cash in investing activities were partially offset by net sales and maturities of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in our investing activities was million for fiscal  which was primarily due to net cash paid of million in connection with the acquisitions of vxp and zensys  purchases of software  equipment and leasehold improvements of million and purchases of private equity investments for million  partially offset by net sales and maturities of marketable securities and long term investment of million 
net cash used in our investing activities was million for fiscal  primarily due to net purchases of marketable securities of million and purchases of software  equipment and leasehold improvements of million 
cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal which was due to million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and employee stock purchases and million of excess tax benefit from share based compensation 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  which was the result of million for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock  partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchase rights and million of excess tax benefit from share based compensation 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  which primarily consisted of million of net proceeds from our follow on offering and million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
prior to fiscal  our primary sources of funds were proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
in certain periods  cash generated from operations has been a source of funds 
while we generated cash from operations for fiscal  and  it is possible that our operations will consume cash in future periods 
based on our currently anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current reserve of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities during or beyond the next mont hs and our future capital requirements may vary significantly from those currently planned 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balances will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow revenue  the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us and the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
at january   we held nine ars  with an adjusted cost and par value of million  which are all classified as short term marketable securities 
our marketable securities consist primarily of auction rate securities  corporate bonds and us agency notes 
we monitor all our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have had a decline in fair value  we use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to h old the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we would recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
historically  the fair value of our ars has been determined by the frequent auction periods  generally every days  which provided liquidity at par value for these investments 
however  subsequent to february  all auctions involving such securities held by us have failed 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars will continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will continue to be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for these ars develop 
 we cannot be certain regarding the amount of time it will take for an auction market or other markets to develop for these securities 
in october  our cash investment advisor  ubs  acknowledged our acceptance of its proposal of a comprehensive settlement agreement  in which all the ars currently in our portfolio could be redeemed at par value 
the offer to redeem will be at our option during a two year period beginning in june the offer also gives ubs the discretion to buy any or all of these securities from us at par value at any time 
additionally  the proposed solution by ubs to the lack of liquidity of our ars included a commitment effective october through june to loan an amount up to of the par value of the ars 
the interest charged on such loan would be equal to the proportional amount of interest being paid by the issuers of the ars borrowed against 
at january   ubs provided an estimated value for the nine ars of approximately million  which reflects an unrealized loss of million from our adjusted cost 
we have not adopted ubs estimated value of our ars for the reasons described below 
we have reviewed the prospectuses for each of the nine ars in our investment portfolio as of january  and determined that the unprecedented disruption in the auction process and resulting pattern of interest payments was in accordance with their established rules of operation under these circumstances 
the default mechanism called for in the operating rules of these instruments is designed to adjust their interest payments to a limit based on the income generated by their underlying student loans 
the most significant consequences of this mechanism are the preservation of their aaa credit rating while adjusting to a continuing stream of interest payments to the security holders at a rate correlating to contemporary credit market rates 
as a result of this review  we reached the conclusion that the securities do have a strong underlying principle value and that any potential adjustment in their carrying value would be based upon our ability to endure their lack of liquidity  the degree of certainty of continuing interest payments and the rate of return on these securities 
given that we expect considerable liquidity from our other assets  foresee continuing positive cash flow and have accepted our investment advisor s offer to purchase all of our ars at par value in june  we do not consider the remaining possible liquidity risk and ubs default risk to be significant enough to justify a reduction in their carrying value 
the remaining valuation factor that we considered was the rate of return evidenced by the interes t received 
we used a discounted cash flow calculation that reached a valuation that was similar to other of our recent investments with comparably high credit ratings 
as a result of this judgment process and in accordance with the various accounting pronouncements in this area  we reached the conclusion that the carrying value of our ars has not been impaired and that we have no expectation of any material adverse impact on our future results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources associated with holding these securities 
contractual obligations and commitments we generally do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments from any of our suppliers 
additionally  we generally acquire products for sale to our customers based on purchase orders received as well as forecasts from such customers 
purchase orders with delivery dates greater than twelve weeks are typically cancelable without penalty to our customers 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase semiconductor wafers  other materials and finished goods from our suppliers on an eight to twelve week lead time basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our operations and financial condition 
to mitigate some of the foreign currency exchange rate risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity at january  and january   we held approximately million and million  respectively  of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities 
if short term interest rates were to decrease  the decreased interest income associated with these cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would not have a significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
at january   we held nine ars  with an adjusted cost and par value of million  which are all classified as short term marketable securities

foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity we derive our revenue in us dollar 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency except for our subsidiaries in canada  denmark  france and japan where the canadian dollar  danish krone  euro and japanese yen are the primary financial currencies  respectively 
a significant portion of our israel subsidiary payroll related expenses  consisting principally of salaries and related personnel expenses are denominated in israeli shekels 
this foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the us dollar against the israeli shekel 
to the extent the us dollar weakens again st the israeli shekel  our israel subsidiary will experience a negative impact on its results of operations 
as of january   we had not entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and inter company balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  for our israel operation  we do hedge portions of our forecasted expenses that are denominated in the israeli shekel with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as of january   we had foreign exchange forward and option contracts with notional amounts of million and million  respectively  in place to hedge certain forecasted israeli shekels denominated operating expenses of our israel operation 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges pursuant to asc  derivatives and hedging 
the se hedges of cash flow exposures will only mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange exposure 
we will remain exposed to the currency risk of our cash flow exposures 
we maintain certain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar  canadian dollar  euro  danish krone  singapore dollar and israeli shekel 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by million
