competition the crude oil and natural gas businesses are highly competitive 
competition is particularly intense to acquire desirable producing properties  to acquire crude oil and natural gas exploration prospects or properties with known reserves  suitable for enhanced development and production efforts  and to hire qualified and experienced human resources 
our competitors include the major integrated energy companies  as well as numerous independent oil and gas companies  individual proprietors  and drilling programs 
many of these competitors possess and employ financial and human resources substantially greater than ours 
our competitors may also have a superior capability for evaluating  bidding  and acquiring desirable producing properties and exploration prospects 
we also face significant competition in our precious metals and minerals business 
competition is particularly intense to acquire mineral prospects and deposits suitable for exploration and development  to acquire reserves  and to hire qualified and experienced human resources 
our competitors in mineral property exploration  acquisition  development  and production include the major mining companies in addition to numerous intermediate and junior mining companies  mineral property investors and individual proprietors 
governmental regulation petroleum exploration  development  storage  and sales activities are extensively regulated at both the federal and state levels in the united states 
likewise  the same is true for the exploration  development  and operation of minerals and precious metals properties 
legislation affecting our businesses is under ongoing review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the related regulatory burden 
numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  rules and regulations affecting the crude oil  natural gas  minerals  and precious metals industries 
compliance with these rules and regulations is often difficult and costly  and there are substantial penalties for noncompliance 
state statutes and regulations requi re permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  and reports concerning operations 
our operations are also subject to numerous laws and regulations governing plugging and abandonment  the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
the heavy regulatory burden on our businesses increases the cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
given the uncertainty of the regulatory environment  we cannot predict the impact of governmental regulation on our financial condition or operating results 
environmental regulation our crude oil and natural gas operations are subject to risks of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  ruptures  or discharges of toxic gases  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses due to injury or loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of property  natural resources  and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  and suspension of operations 
we have contracted a credentialed specialist in health  safety  environmental  and permitting functions  and  in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against these kinds of risks 
our insurance coverage may not cover all losses in the event of a drilling or production catastrophe 
crude oil and natural gas operations can result in liability under federal  state  and local environmental regulations for activities involving  among other things  water pollution and hazardous waste transport  storage  and disposal 
such liability can attach not only to the operator of record of the well  but also to other parties that may be deemed to be current or prior operators or owners of the wells or the equipment involved 
numerous governmental agencies issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws  which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative  civil  and criminal penalties and  in some cases  injunctive relief for failure to comply 
some laws  rules  and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may  in certain circumstan ces  impose strict liability for environmental contamination 
these laws can render a person or company liable for environmental and natural resource damages  cleanup costs  and  in the case of oil spills  consequential damages without regard to negligence or fault 
other laws  rules  and regulations may require the rate of oil and gas production to be below the economically optimal rate or may even prohibit exploration or production activities in environmentally sensitive areas 
in addition  these laws often require some form of remedial action  such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells  to prevent pollution from former or suspended operations 
compliance with environmental requirements  including financial assurance requirements and the costs associated with the cleanup of any spill  could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or earnings 
these laws and regulations have not had a material effect on the company to date 
nevertheless  environmental laws and changes in environmental laws have the potential to adversely affect operations 
at this time  we have no plans to make any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 
our precious metals and minerals exploration and property development activities in alaska are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations are continually changing  are generally becoming more restrictive  and have the potential to adversely affect our minerals exploration and property development activities

we furnish our shareholders with a copy of our annual report on form k which contains audited financial statements and such other reports as we  from time to time  may deem appropriate or as may be required by law 
we use the calendar year as our fiscal year 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition  as well as  adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
changing global and local commodity pricing strongly impacts the company s operating results 
our operating results depend heavily upon our ability to market our crude oil and natural gas production at favorable prices 
the factors influencing the prices of the commodities we sell are beyond our control  including changes in consumption patterns  global and local economic conditions  production disruptions  opec actions  and other factors that impact supply and demand for oil and gas 
lower crude oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of these commodities we can economically develop and produce  and  in turn  may have a material  adverse effect on the carrying value of our assets  reserves  and operating results 
any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves 
our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves depend on estimates that include reservoir characteristics and recoverability  as well as capital and operating costs 
any changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material  negative impact to the volume of reserves reported 
unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves  our future crude oil and natural gas production will decline  resulting in an adverse impact to our business 
the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent that we perform successful exploration  development  or acquisition activities  or through engineering studies  identify additional or secondary recovery reserves  our proved reserves will decline as we produce crude oil and natural gas 
likewise  if we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas we produce with good prospects for future production  our business will experience reduced cash flow and results of operations 
as our rates of production have been relatively low  our risk of reserve depletion is  likewise  low for the immediate future 
we have a current need for development capital 
without such capital  our ability to incre ase production will be hindered 
crude oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous mechanical and environmental risks that could reduce production 
in addition to the risk that no commercially productive crude oil or natural gas reservoirs may be found  our operations may be curtailed  delayed  or canceled 
title problems  weather conditions  compliance with governmental regulations  mechanical difficulties  and shortages or delays in the delivery of drilling rigs and other equipment may limit our ability to develop  produce  or market our reserves 
drilling for crude oil and natural gas may result in losses  not only as a result of drilling dry wells but also from wells that are productive but produce insufficient net revenues to be profitable on a full cost basis 
likewise  our properties may be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
our business operating risks include  but are not limited to  the risks of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations  as well as environmental hazards  such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  ruptures  or discharges of toxic gases  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against these kinds of risks  but our level of insurance may not cover all losses in the event of a drilling or production catastrophe 
insurance is not available for all operational risks  such as risks that we will drill a dry hole  fail in an attempt to complete a well  or have problems maintaining production from existing wells 
crude oil and natural gas operations can result in liability under federal  state  and local environmental regulations for activities involving  among other things  water pollution and hazardous waste transport  storage  and disposal 
such liability can attach to the operator of record of the well and also to other parties that may be deemed to be current or prior operators or owners of the wells or the equipment involved 
thus  environmental laws could subject us to liabilities for environmental damages even where we are not the operator who caused the environmental damage 
future governmental and environmental regulations may increase our costs of production  impact or limit our current business plans  and reduce demand for our products 
as explained in detail in part i  item governmental regulation and in item environmental regulation  united states exploration for the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas is extensively regulated at both the federal and state levels 
our oil and gas business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations 
any change in such laws  rules  regulations  or interpretations  may have a material  adverse effect on our revenues  operating income  and cash flow 
additionally  we could be adversely affected by potential legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases or use of fossil fuels  the adoption of which may increase our costs to find  develop  and produce crude oil and natural gas in the future 
currently pending lawsuits threaten to limit potential development of a significant and valuable heavy oil project 
there are currently two legal actions pending against us that may result in the termination of leases to properties in our pleasant valley project 
please see part i  item legal proceedings 
drilling and production operations have not yet commenced on one of these leases  and operations on the other leases are currently suspended  pending the installation of an improved electric distribution system that is required by a local regulatory body 
we believe that the leases have significant potential for development  but if the lessors are successful in terminating the oil and gas leases  our potential for future development in the pleasant valley field will be significantly impaired 
we are vigorously pursuing and defending these lawsuits  as we b elieve that we have valid claims and defenses 
the litigation involves two of our three leases in the pleasant valley field 
our drilling rig operations have not had significant consistent revenue 
although our drilling rig operations began in  to date  we have not realized an economic rig utilization rate 
demand continues to be very weak  and we have idled our sole drilling rig 
we have no employees devoted to this business 
future drilling rig operations may not be profitable due to the entry of new  lower cost competitors and continued weak demand 
our minerals business has not yet realized significant revenue and is not presently profitable 
select resources corporation  inc  was formed in late to manage our precious metals and industrial minerals properties in alaska 
the precious metal properties will require additional investment to discover and delineate sufficient mineral resources to justify any future commercial development 
the calcium carbonate industrial minerals property could be returned to commercial production if sufficient purchase commitments are secured 
to date  we have realized no significant revenue and cannot predict when  if ever  we may see significant returns from our precious metal and mineral investments 
the value of our minerals business depends on numerous factors not under our control 
the economic value of our minerals business may be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices for gold and calcium carbonate  increases in production and or capital costs  and increased environmental or permitting requirements by federal and state governments 
if our mineral properties commence production  our operating results and cash flow may be impaired by reductions in forecast grade or tonnage of the deposits  dilution of the mineral content of the ore  reduction in recovery rates  and a reduction in reserves  as well as unforeseen delays in the development of our projects 
finally  new competitors able to operate at lower costs may enter the industry 
the value of our minerals business may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance 
our minerals business is subject to a number of risks and hazards including  but not limited to  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  unusual or unexpected geologic formations  and unanticipated hydrologic conditions  including flooding and periodic interruptions caused by inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
we have contracted a credentialed specialist in health  safety  environmental  and permitting functions 
for some of these risks  we maintain insurance to protect against these losses at levels consistent with our historical experience  industry practice  and circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
insurance against environmental risks is generally either unavailable or  we believe  unaffordable  and  therefore  we do not maintain environmental insurance 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may impair the value of our minerals business 
risks involved in our business generally forward looking statements some of the information in this annual report form k contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words  such as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  and continue  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition state other forward looking information 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict and or over which we have no control 
the risk factors listed in this section  other risk factors about which we may not be aware  as well as  any cautionary language in this report  provide examples of risks  uncertainties  and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
ability to operate as a going concern if we are unable to obtain additional funding  our business will be materially impaired 
the company remains dependent on capital formation for funding its operating and general and administrative requirements for availability of capital is dependent on many external factors  such as the current economic climate and interest rates  among others  and may not be available to the company when needed 
important sources for capital in the past have been investment in the tvc opus drilling program  lp and the private placement of our restricted common stock 
although we have been successful in the past at attracting sufficient capital  we do not have certainty that additional financing will be available when needed on acceptable terms 
insufficient financing may prevent or limit us from implementing our business strategy 
our cash balance as of december   was million 
current liabilities were million on that date 
it should be noted  however  that accounts payable to joint venture partners comprised million of the million in total current liabilities and were offset by million in accounts receivable from joint venture partners in total current assets on that date 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and  for additional discussion 
in light of this and other factors  our independent accountant has included a going concern qualification in its report on our financial statements for the year ended december   noting that our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on additional sources of capital and the succes s of our business strategy 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties our principal properties consist of proven and unproven crude oil and natural gas properties  mining claims on unproven precious metals properties  and a fee interest in an industrial minerals property 
oil and gas the following properties are operated by the company and have been funded in part by the tvc opus drilling program  lp pleasant valley this property is located in ventura county  california  in the oxnard oil field where we are in the early stages of developing and producing heavy oil from the upper vaca tar formation 
the california state department of oil and gas and geothermal resources has published estimates that the upper vaca tar has over million barrels of original oil in place ooip  of which we and our partners control about million barrels of ooip attributable to pleasant valley as estimated by an independent reserves engineering firm in october during  we drilled a total of seven horizontal wells and installed temporary production facilities  and in  we commenced cyclic steaming operations 
during  production was curtailed periodically to accommodate installation of larger diameter flow lines  production manifolds  and artificial lift equipment on three of the seven wells  and to test steam injection parameters on individual wells 
smaller diameter tubing was also installed in all seven wells to achieve better steam distribution 
our plans for include the drilling of a horizontal injector well that will be paired with an existing horizontal producing well to test steam assisted gravity drainage sagd technology for future deployment to fully develop and produce the upper vaca tar 
we also plan this year to convert a vertical well to a water disposal well to eliminate the cost of offsite water disposal once regulatory approval of our application is received 
temblor valley west south belridge field the south belridge properties are located in kern county  california  west of bakersfield  and include a total of wells  six producing  one active injection well  and idle wells 
five wells were drilled in  and these wells extended the known oil bearing formations to the west by over a half mile 
oil production on the property comes from the etchegoin formation 
attempts in prior years to increase production by cyclic steaming of the lower diatomite formation and a pilot waterflood of the etchegoin formation proved unsuccessful 
we are currently evaluating other options for these properties  including possible divestiture 
temblor valley east edison field this property is located in kern county  california  east of bakersfield and consists of the shield and arms lease which includes two producing wells  one injection well  and three idle wells 
the two producing wells were completed in the olcese formation and are produced by beam pump 
we are currently evaluating other options for this property  including possible divestiture 
moffat ranch this gas field is located in the southern area of the california gas country in madera county in central california 
the gas field consists of one producing well and three idle wells 
in late  tri valley drilled the deepest wellbore penetration in the field to below  feet to evaluate more than potential producing horizons 
two of these potential gas zones were evaluated for productive potential in  and one was successfully tested at over one million cubic feet per day 
in  attempts to restore the three idle wells to production were unsuccessful 
we have plans to rework one of our idle wells in the second quart er of ekho the ekho no 
exploratory well  located north of bakersfield in kern county  california  was originally drilled by the company to  feet in and encountered hydrocarbons in tight formations in the lower zones of the well 
in  we hydraulically fractured the vedder zone between  and  feet  injecting approximately  barrels of fluid which carried approximately  pounds of bauxite propping material 
while successful mechanically  the fracturing operation did not result in producing hydrocarbons at commercial rates from the vedder zone 
this well still has multiple targets which can be evaluated in the future  and we will continue to look for new technologies that could allow the vedder zone to produce commercially 
sunrise natural gas project this project is located just north of bakersfield  california  in the city of delano and consists of one vertical well and one horizontal well that were drilled by the company in and  respectively  and which encountered tight natural gas in the mcclure shale at approximately  feet 
we believe the mcclure shale may hold up to three trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the mapped area of closure 
in  we hydraulically fractured  feet of the  foot horizontal portion of a well bore in the tight mcclure shale utilizing gelled diesel that carried in approximately  pounds of sand 
again  while mechanically successful like the ekho project  t he fracturing operation did not result in the well producing hydrocarbons from the mcclure shale at commercial rates 
we will continue to review all available technologies to bring the sunrise natural gas project potential to commercial realization given the volume of natural gas in place in the tight reservoir 
in addition  tri valley currently operates the following properties rio vista field the rio vista field is located in solano county  in northern california  and we operate four producing gas wells and two idle wells on two separate leases in this field 
these two separate leases are the hanson and the webb tract 
dutch slough field the dutch slough field is located in contra costa county in northern california  where we operate one producing gas well and two idle wells on the martin severin lease in this field 
edison field race track hill area the edison field property is located east of bakersfield  california  and contains seven idle wells that offset a successful cyclic steaming operation in the santa margarita formation 
we have obtained individual well drilling permits for this property and plan to reactivate production on this lease in with cyclic steaming operations in the second quarter of the year 
we also plan to drill up to new wells beginning in the third quarter of this property  when fully developed  has the potential to produce approximately million barrels of oil for tri valley s interest  based upon an independent engineering report completed in january proved reserves we have retained the services of mr 
leland b 
cecil  pe  an independent petroleum engineer based in bakersfield  california  and ajm petroleum consultants of calgary  alberta  canada  to estimate the company s net share of proved and prospective reserves at december  proved reserve estimates are classified as either developed or undeveloped reserves 
prospective reserves are differentiated as probable reserves and possible reserves 
the estimates were prepared according to the guidelines established by the us securities and exchange commission the sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb for valuation of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are use for the estimation 
projects to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced  or the operator must be reasonably certain it will commence the projects within a reasonable time 
proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped 
proved developed reserv es are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well  and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
prospective reserves are differentiated according to reservoir characteristics and exhibited recovery from efforts analogous to the subject properties 
probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which  together with proved reserves  are as likely as not to be recovered 
probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain  even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion 
likewise  probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir 
finally  possi ble reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves 
possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain 
frequently  this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project 
possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves 
engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information 
our estimated future net recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves as of december    and  were as follows year ending bbl mcf crude oil natural gas december  developed undeveloped net proved probable possible net prospective december  developed undeveloped net proved probable possible net prospective december  developed undeveloped net proved probable possible net prospective december  developed undeveloped net proved probable possible net prospective economics for determined reserves in were formulated from market conditions that existed during the twelve months of the year 
product sale prices were calculated from applicable prices posted on the first day of the calendar months 
operating expenses were normalized for a twelve month moving average 
no consideration was given to potential future inflation of either product sale prices or costs relative to future operation 
the present value of projected future net income was calculated at an annual discount rate of 
on this basis  future net revenue to be derived from our proved developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves was million at december  using year end crude oil and natural gas prices and prevailing levels of lease operating expenses  the estimated present value of the future net revenue to be derived from our proved developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves  discounted at  was million at december   and million at december  the precipitous drop in crude oil reported reserves from the end of to the end of was due to the collapse of crude oil prices in the second half of this resulted in the proved producing reserves on our producing oil wells at the time to be written down to zero in the reserve report 
on december   the sec issued release no 
amending its oil and natural gas reporting requirements for oil and natural gas producing companies 
the effective date of the new accounting and disclosure requirements is for annual reports filed for fiscal years ending on or after december  among other things release no 
revises a number of definitions relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves to make them consistent with the petroleum resource management system  which includes certain non traditional resources in proved reserves 
permits the use of new technologies for determining proved oil and natural gas reserves 
requires the use of average prices for the trailing twelve month period in the estimation of oil and natural gas reserve quantities and for companies using the full cost method of accounting  in computing the ceiling limitation  in place of a single day price as of the end of the fiscal year 
permits the disclosure in filings with the sec of probable and possible reserves and reserves sensitivity to changes in prices 
requires additional disclosures outside of the financial statements regarding the status of undeveloped reserves and changes in status of these from period to period 
requires a discussion of the internal controls in place to assure objectivity in the reserve estimation process and disclosure of the technical qualifications of the technical person having primarily responsibility for preparing the reserve estimates 
companies are not permitted to use the new sec requirements for fiscal years ending prior to december  we have evaluated the effect that adoption of the final rule will have on our financial statements and oil and natural gas reserve estimates and disclosures 
based on a review by our independent petroleum engineer  we believe that  if the new requirements had been in effect for our fiscal  our reported natural gas and crude oil reserves would have been substantially higher than those reported under the currently applied sec standards 
notably  the use of trailing twelve month average prices instead of year end prices would have dramatically increased the value of our reserves 
in fiscal  the prices we received for oil production varied from a high of per barrel to a low of per barrel  with the year end price on which reserves were calculated being per barrel

the richardson and shorty creek precious metal properties are exploration stage gold properties which require additional capital to fully evaluate their gold and minerals potential 
there is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on either of these precious metal properties 
current economic conditions point towards continued strength for precious metal prices  and we plan to maintain a strong focus on these properties 
our industrial minerals property  the admiral calder quarry calder  contains over million tons of high grade minable resource in place according to our independent engineering estimates and was partially developed and produced for a short time by the previous owner 
select acquired calder in but has neither mined nor sold any product from the property 
shorty creek in january  we acquired the shorty creek property shorty which is located in the tolovana district about miles northwest of fairbanks  alaska  along the paved  all weather elliot highway that is the principal route used to access the north slope petroleum production areas 
shorty has been described by a state geologist of alaska as perhaps the best drill ready gold exploration project in the state  and it directly offsets  and is on trend with  international tower hill s ongoing exploration drilling program at its livengood gold project which has so far defined million ounces of gold indicated and inferred 
shorty creek is a gold or possible polymetalic exploration project where we have conducted previous campaigns of exploration work that included geochemical sampling and drilling which have identified anomalous concentrations of gold  copper  molybdenum  and their pathfinder elements 
in we carried out geophysical and satellite interpretation programs over a large portion of shorty creek and a multi element soil auger geochemical program extending over one of four distinctive aeromagnetic anomalies  covering an area approximately of one mile  resulting in the identification of five precious metal and base metal anomalies 
this same year we acquired mineral rights to state of alaska mining claims through staking and lease arrangements from gold range ltd  covering approximately square miles 
in  additional property was acquired through contractors  essentially doubling shorty s property position to about square miles  and was based on geophysics and third party gold geochemistry 
also in  we acquired regional geochemistry data from the state of alaska and an interpretation of that data by the university of alaska which significantly enhanced the potential of shorty creek 
the state s geochemistry data was collected over a  square mile area that includes shorty creek 
from this data  the university determined that the highest two and one quarter percent concentrations of precious and base metals are clustered in a square mile area and about eighty five percent of this cluster lies within the boundaries of the shorty creek prospect 
to date  we have not identified proven or probable mineral reserves on shorty creek 
based on archived data  including the state of alaska geochemistry data and the university of alaska study  significant mineralization has been identified on the property  and if determined to be of adequate size  quality  and spatial distribution  the final extent of this mineralization could prove to be economic in the future 
further exploration is required before a final evaluation as to the economic and technical feasibility can be determined 
to that end  we have contracted avalon development corporation to prepare an ni canadian form report for shorty creek which should be completed in the second quarter of and continue to pursue options for funding additional exploration work on the property 
the following table sets forth the information regarding the acreage position of the shorty creek claim block as of december  gross acres net acres richardson the richardson property richardson is located in the richardson district  one of the most prospective and underexplored gold exploration districts in east central alaska 
our claims are located near the all weather paved richardson highway  about seventy miles southeast of fairbanks  alaska  and just south of the nearby trans alaska pipeline corridor that provides access to our claims from the north 
we acquired the bulk of the richardson property in  and it covers  acres of land  all of which is owned by the state of alaska 
the richardson project is an early stage gold exploration project with past placer production and pilot size lode gold production 
geophysical and geochemical signatures are consistent with intrusion related gold systems 
nine highly prospective zones have been identified in previous exploration programs carried out by the company and previous owners 
in late  we initiated geophysical and satellite interpretation programs over the entire richardson property and a multi element soil auger geochemical program  extending along approximately miles of the richardson lineament that appears to extend to miles in length 
the survey found six precious metal and other element anomalies 
we also conducted  feet of diamond drilling in the democrat mine area which indicated gold and silver mineralization 
to date  we have no proven or probable mineral reserves on richardson and have contracted with avalon development corporation to produce an ni report canadian form that will be prepared in after completion of a similar report for shorty creek

independent estimates conclude that calder may hold in excess of million tons of high chemical grade  high brightness  and high whiteness calcium carbonate resource in place 
by some authorities  calder has the potential to be a world class producer of calcium carbonate for several markets harben and lobdell  peter harben  inc 
select paid million in to acquire calder from sealaska corporation  which had invested approximately million to partially delineate and develop the mineral deposit  including installations of mining materials handling equipment  marine loading facilities  and other infrastructure on the property 
the quarry covers only acres  but the entire property covers acres of patented mining ground and includes all operating permits and tideland leases 
less than of the acreage has been explored  and geologic mapping suggests substantially more resources exist on the property 
the property has been in a care and maintenance mode since while we pursued additional capital  potential partners  and calcium carbonate product customers that would facilitate restarting quarry operations 
 improved global economic conditions in the future should stimulate demand for calcium carbonate which is a key ingredient in over  products including paper and paints 
industrial minerals projects such as calder must be competitive with other producers in terms of quality  volume  and cif pricing to gain customers 
calder s seaside location and marine loading facilities offer a distinct competitive advantage 
in  select continued negotiations with prospective buyers for calcium carbonate who had obtained product quality tests from outside parties 
these tests confirmed the extremely high quality of the calcium carbonate in the size range of over ten microns and also better quantified the reduced whiteness and brightness for the two micron size fraction 
in  we are pursuing options to monetize calder  including redevelopment of the quarry  outright sale or lease  joint venture  or a combination of these three options

hansen et al  no 
cu or vta  superior court  ventura county  california 
on may   we filed a quiet title action against the lessors of our scholle livingston oil and gas lease 
on july   the defendants filed a cross complaint 
our action seeks to quiet title to our oil and gas lease by affirming the validity of the lease  and the cross complaint seeks to terminate the lease 
our present intention is to develop this lease as part of our pleasant valley project 
although we have yet to commence drilling or production operations on this lease  we believe it has significant and valuable heavy oil deposits 
the present status of the action is that the parties are in the process of discovery  with a trial date scheduled for may  we are vigorously pursuing this lawsuit as we believe that we have valid claims and defenses 
lenox v 
tri valley corporation  no 
cu or vta  superior court  ventura county  california on september   the lessors of our lenox and snodgrass oil and gas leases filed a quiet title action against us 
our answer to the action was filed on november  the principal relief sought by lessors is for a declaration of quiet title by declaring a termination of our lenox and snodgrass oil and gas leases in our pleasant valley project 
our present intention is to develop these leases as part of our pleasant valley project which we believe has significant and valuable heavy oil deposits 
we drilled one well and reworked several others on these leases 
however  operations are currently suspended pending the installation of an improved electric distribution system that is required by a local regulatory body in order to address air emissions requirements 
the present status of the action is t hat initial pleadings have been exchanged  and the process of discovery is the likely next step for the parties 
however  at this time  neither party has propounded discovery on the other 
we are vigorously defending this lawsuit as we believe that we have valid claims and defenses

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition notice regarding forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements 
the words  anticipate  believe  expect  plan  intend  estimate  project  could  may  foresee  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include information regarding expected development of the company s business  lending activities  relationship with customers  and development in the oil and gas industry 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially and adversely from those anticipated  believed  estimated  or otherwise indicated 
overview prices for crude oil tend to be influenced by large  national state oil companies based upon global supply and demand  while natural gas prices seem to be more dependent on national and local conditions 
we expect that natural gas prices will hold steady over the next two years 
if  however  prices should fall  due to new regulatory measures or the discovery of new and easily producible reserves  our revenue from crude oil and natural gas sales would also fall 
we continue grading and prioritizing our proprietary geologic library  which contains over leads and prospects  in the state of california for exploratory drilling 
we use our library  seismic database  and other geoscientific data as resources for determining future opportunities for potential exploration 
we believe we have acquired an inventory of under explored and under exploited properties with the potential to yield significant returns upon development 
our future results will depend on our success in finding new reserves  in commercially developing those reserves  and in developing the reserves we currently have 
there can be no assurance as to the revenue we ultimately derive from any new discoveries 
we do not engage in hedging activities and do not use commodity futures or forward contracts for commodity price risk management 
critical accounting policies we prepare consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report contains a comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
the estimates that are most critical to our consolidated financial statements involve oil and gas reserves and impairment of oil and gas properties 
oil and gas reserves 
estimates of our proved crude oil and gas reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines and were based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers with respect to our properties 
the accuracy of a reserve report estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual future results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows included in this report as of december   is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
changes in crude oil and gas prices can cause revisions in our estimates if the sales price on which reserves are based makes it uneconomical to continue producing the reserves based on our current production costs 
in and  our average and year end price received for natural gas was significantly higher than our average production costs  and it appeared unlikely that natural gas prices would fall far enough to result in an impairment based on historic prices 
however  a significant fall in the price of crude oil in caused a reduction in our crude oil reserves and resulted in recording an impairment expense a s discussed below 
because of the impairment of crude oil reserves to a value of zero  no further reduction was possible 
estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of its crude oil and natural gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of proved crude oil and natural gas properties 
we review our long lived proved properties  consisting of crude oil and natural gas reserves  at least annually and record impairments to those properties  whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
proved crude oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment by depletable field pool  which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook for future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties 
we determine that a property is impaired when pric es being paid for crude oil or natural gas no longer make drilling or continued production profitable on that property 
a dramatic price decrease in crude oil and natural gas prices during the second half of required the company to impair reserves and record an impairment expense of million for the year for proved properties 
price increases in prior years did reduce the instances where impairment of reserves appeared to be required  however  we did record impairment expense of million in and million in  as a result of reducing potential future recoverable reserves 
these assets are expected to remain impaired 
we do not currently expect that changes in the price of natural gas would result in impairment of our natural gas properties because our production costs are significantly less than historic market prices 
however  if natural gas prices in norther n california fall below our historic production costs of to per mcf  more of our proved developed reserves could become impaired 
this  in turn  would reduce our estimates of future revenue  our proved reserve estimates  and our profitability 
other significant accounting policies successful efforts method of accounting 
we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities  as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method 
in general  we believe that  during periods of active exploration  net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas producing activities than under the full cost method 
the critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method of accounting is as follows under the successful efforts method  exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur  whereas  under the full cost method of accounting  such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets  pooled with the costs of successful wells  and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense 
stock based compensation 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting codification asc topic  stock compensation  to account for our stock option plan  beginning january  this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the modified prospective method was selected 
under this method  we recognized stock option compensation expense as if we had applied the fair value method to account for unvested stock options from the original effective date 
stock option compensation expense was recognized from the date of grant to the vesting date 
the fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that used the following assumptions expected volatilities were based on the historical volatility of our stock  we used historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model  the expected term of options granted was based on historical exercise behavior and represented the period of time that options granted were expected to be outstanding 
the company used this methodology for valuing the stock option grants issued during  the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on us treasury rates in effect at the time of grant 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting codification asc topic  to account for income taxes 
we maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which result from net operating losses and statutory depletion carry forwards from prior years 
asc  income taxes  requires that the company continually assess both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset can be realized prior to its expiration 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
addition ally  our federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each calendar year  as well as  the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and tax credit carry forwards 
due to uncertainties involved with tax matters  the future effective tax rate may vary significantly from the estimated current year effective tax rate 
asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold as an uncertain tax position is required to meet before tax benefits associated with such uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements 
as of december   the company has concluded that more likely than not it will not realize its gross deferred tax asset position  after giving consideration to relevant facts and circumstances 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to monitor company specific  crude oil and natural gas industry economic factors and will reassess the likelihood that the company s net operating loss and statutory depletion carry forwards will be utilized prior to their expiration 
commitments and contingencies 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting codification asc topic  to account for commitments and contingencies 
we make judgments and estimates regarding possible liabilities for litigation and environmental remediation on a quarterly basis 
management s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers and the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators or courts of the law 
we have no ongoing environmental remediation 
we routinely have clean up and maintenance obligations in connection with crude oil and natural gas drilling and production activities  but we have never had a material environmental liabili ty or claim 
actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons 
environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations  additional information obtained relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 
in accordance with asc  a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimated 
a change in estimate could impact our oil and gas operating costs and the liability  if applicable  recorded on our balance sheet
