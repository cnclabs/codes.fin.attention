industry trends 
we operate in the family entertainment resort segment of the travel and leisure industry 
the concept of a family entertainment resort with an indoor waterpark was first introduced to the united states in wisconsin dells  wisconsin  and has evolved since in an effort to boost occupancy and daily rates  as well as capture off season demand  hotel operators in the wisconsin dells market began expanding indoor pools and adding waterslides and other water based attractions to existing hotels and resorts 
the success of these efforts prompted several local operators to build new  larger destination resorts based primarily on the concept 

table of contents we believe that these properties  which typically are themed and include other resort features such as arcades  retail shops and full food and beverage service in addition to the indoor waterpark  have historically outperformed standard hotels in the market 
we believe that the rate premiums and increased market share in the wisconsin dells for hotels and resorts with some form of an indoor waterpark can be attributed to several factors  including the ability to provide a year round vacation destination without weather related risks  the wide appeal of water based recreation and the favorable trends in leisure travel discussed below 
while no standard industry definition for a family entertainment resort featuring an indoor waterpark has developed  we generally consider resorts with at least rooms featuring indoor waterparks larger than  square feet  as well as a variety of water slides and other water based attractions  to be competitive with our resorts 
a hotel leisure advisors  llc h la survey as of june indicates that there are open indoor waterpark resort properties in the united states and canada 
of the total  are considered indoor waterpark destination resorts offering more than  square feet of indoor waterpark space 
of these properties  are great wolf resorts properties 
we believe recent vacation trends favor drive to family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks  as the number of families choosing to take shorter  more frequent vacations that they can drive to have increased in recent years 
we believe these trends will continue 
we believe indoor waterpark resorts are generally less affected by changes in economic cycles  as drive to destinations are generally less expensive and more convenient than destinations that require air travel 
outlook 
we believe that no other operator or developer other than us has established a national portfolio of destination family entertainment resorts that feature indoor waterparks 
our resorts do  however  compete directly with other family entertainment resorts in several of our markets 
we intend to continue to expand our portfolio of resorts throughout the united states and to selectively seek licensing and management opportunities domestically and internationally 
the resorts we plan to develop  license and or operate in the future require significant industry knowledge and substantial capital resources 
our external growth strategy going forward is to seek joint venture  licensing and management opportunities 
we expect each of these joint venture arrangements would involve us having a minority or no ownership interest in the new resort 
we believe there are opportunities to capitalize on our existing brand and operational platforms with lower capital requirements from us than if we were the sole or majority owner of the new resort 
our primary business objective is to increase long term stockholder value 
we believe we can increase stockholder value by executing our internal and external growth strategies 
our primary growth strategies are leveraging our competitive advantages and increasing domestic geographic diversification through a license based business model and joint venture investments in target markets  expanding our brand footprint internationally  selective sales of ownership interests recycling of capital  expanding and enhancing existing resorts  continuing to innovate  maximizing total resort revenues  minimizing total resort costs  and building upon our existing brand awareness and loyalty 
in attempting to execute our internal and external growth strategies  we are subject to a variety of business challenges and risks 
these risks include those described under risk factors risks related to our business activities and risk factors risks related to regulation 
we seek to meet these challenges by providing sufficient management oversight to site selection  development and resort operations  concentrating on growing and strengthening awareness of our brand and demand for our resorts  and maintaining our focus on safety 

table of contents our business model is highly dependent on consumer spending  because the majority of our revenues are earned from leisure guests and a vacation experience at one of our resorts is a discretionary expenditure for a family 
over the past two years  the slowing us economy has led to a decrease in credit for consumers and a related decrease in consumer discretionary spending 
this trend continued through as consumers experienced several negative economic impacts  including severe turbulence in the banking and lending sectors  which has led to a general lessening of the availability of credit to consumers  an increased national unemployment rate  a continuing decline in the national average of home prices and an increase in the national home foreclosure rate  and high volatility in the stock market that led to substantial declines in stock values and aggregate household savings from to these and other factors impact the amount of discretionary income for consumers and consumer sentiment toward discretionary purchases 
as a result  these types of items could negatively impact consumer spending in future periods 
while we believe the convenience  quality and overall affordability of a stay at one of our resorts continues to be an attractive alternative to other potential family vacations  a sustained decrease in overall consumer discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our overall results 
we develop resorts with expectations of achieving certain financial returns on a resort s operation 
the economic slowdown of the past two years has materially and adversely affected our ability to achieve the operating results on our resorts that we had expected to achieve when those resorts were first planned and developed 
also we believe that our traverse city and sandusky resorts have been and will continue to be affected by especially adverse general economic circumstances in the michigan northern ohio region such as bankruptcies of several major companies and or large announced layoffs by major employers and increased competition that has occurred in these markets over the past few years 
the michigan northern ohio region includes cities that have historically been the traverse city and sandusky resorts largest source of customers 
we believe the adverse general economic circumstances in the region have negatively impacted overall discretionary consumer spending in that region over the past few years and may continue to do so going forward 
although we have taken steps to reduce our operating costs at these resorts  we believe the general regional economic downturn has and may continue to have an impact on the operating performance of our traverse city and sandusky resorts 
our wisconsin dells property has been significantly impacted by the abundance of competing indoor waterpark resorts in that market 
the wisconsin dells market has approximately indoor waterpark resorts that compete with us 
we believe this large number of competing properties in a relatively small tourist destination location has and will likely continue to have an adverse impact on the operating performance of our wisconsin dells resort 
we have experienced much lower than expected occupancy and lower than expected average daily room rates at our sheboygan  wisconsin property since its opening in we believe this operating weakness has been primarily attributable to the fact that the overall development of sheboygan as a tourist destination continues to lag materially behind our initial expectations 
we believe this has materially impacted and will likely continue to impact the consumer demand for our indoor waterpark resort in that market and the operations of the resort 
as described under critical accounting policies and estimates investments in property and equipment  we recorded a  impairment charge in relating to our sheboygan resort 
the impaired long lived asset is included in our resort ownership operation segment 
our mason resort opened its first phase in december and has experienced lower than expected occupancy and lower than expected average daily room rates 
we believe this is due  in part  to the opening of competitive properties in the region 

table of contents our external growth strategies are based primarily on developing additional indoor waterpark resorts in conjunction with joint venture partners or by licensing our intellectual property and proprietary management systems to others 
developing resorts of the size and scope of our family entertainment resorts generally requires obtaining financing for a significant portion of a project s expected construction costs 
the general tightening in us lending markets has dramatically decreased the overall availability of construction financing 
although the ultimate effect on our external growth strategy of the current credit environment is difficult to predict with certainty  we believe that the availability of construction financing to us and other investors and or developers may be more restrictive in the future and that terms of construction financing may be less favorable than we have seen historically 
although we believe that we and other investors and or developers may be able to continue to obtain construction financing sufficient to execute development strategies  we expect that the more difficult credit market environment is likely to continue at least through revenue and key performance indicators 
we seek to generate positive cash flows and maximize our return on invested capital from each of our owned resorts 
our rooms revenue represents sales to guests of room nights at our resorts and is the largest contributor to our cash flows and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  ebitda 
rooms revenue accounted for approximately of our total consolidated resort revenue for the year ended december  we employ sales and marketing efforts to increase overall demand for rooms at our resorts 
we seek to optimize the relationship between room rates and occupancies through the use of yield management techniques that attempt to project demand in order to selectively increase room rates during peak demand 
these techniques are designed to assist us in managing our higher occupancy nights to achieve maximum rooms revenue and include such practices as monitoring our historical trends for occupancy and estimating our high occupancy nights  offering the highest discounts to previous guests in off peak periods to build customer loyalty and enhance our ability to charge higher rates in peak periods  structuring rates to allow us to offer our previous guests the best rate while simultaneously working with a promotional partner or offering internet specials  monitoring sales of room types daily to evaluate the effectiveness of offered discounts  and offering specials on standard suites and yielding better rates on larger suites when standard suites sell out 
in addition  we seek to maximize the amount of time and money spent on site by our guests by providing a variety of revenue generating amenities 
we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these indicators include the following occupancy  average daily room rate  or adr  revenue per available room  or revpar  total revenue per available room  or total revpar  total revenue per occupied room  or total revpor  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hospitality industry to evaluate hotel operations and are defined as follows occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms by total available rooms 
adr is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue by total occupied rooms 

table of contents revpar is the product of occupancy and adr 
total revpar and total revpor are defined as follows total revpar is calculated by dividing total revenue by total available rooms 
total revpor is calculated by dividing total revenue by total occupied rooms 
occupancy allows us to measure the general overall demand for rooms at our resorts and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategies 
adr allows us to measure the effectiveness of our yield management strategies 
while adr and revpar only include rooms revenue  total revpor and total revpar include both rooms revenue and other revenue derived from food and beverage and other amenities at our resorts 
we consider total revpor and total revpar to be key performance indicators for our business because we derive a significant portion of our revenue from food and beverage and other amenities 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total consolidated resort revenues consisted of non rooms revenue 
we use revpar and total revpar to evaluate the blended effect that changes in occupancy  adr and total revpor have on our results 
we focus on increasing adr and total revpor because we believe those increases can have the greatest positive impact on our results 
in addition  we seek to maximize occupancy  as increases in occupancy generally lead to greater total revenues at our resorts  and we believe maintaining certain occupancy levels is key to covering our fixed costs 
increases in total revenues as a result of higher occupancy are  however  typically accompanied by additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
in contrast  increases in total revenues from higher adr and total revpor are typically accompanied by lower incremental costs and result generally  in a greater increase in operating cash flow 
we also use ebitda as a measure of our operational performance of each of our resorts 
ebitda is a supplemental financial measure and is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
see non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of our use of ebitda and a reconciliation to net loss attributable to great wolf resorts  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and our financial reporting process involve the use of accounting estimates based on our current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from our current judgments 
investments in property and equipment 
we record investments in property and equipment at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years fixtures and equipment  including waterpark equipment years we are required to make subjective assessments as to these useful lives for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation and amortization to record annually with respect to our investments in property and equipment 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net loss because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in property and equipment we would depreciate and amortize such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation and amortization expense and a larger net loss on an annual 
table of contents basis 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives we have assigned to our depreciable assets to determine whether those useful lives are reasonable and appropriate 
when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate the carrying values of a long lived asset may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the expected future operations of the asset 
these estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income  operating trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
we have experienced much lower than expected occupancy and lower than expected average daily room rates at our sheboygan resort since its opening in we believe this operating weakness has been primarily attributable to the fact that the overall development of sheboygan as a tourist destination continues to lag significantly behind our initial expectations 
we believe this has materially impacted and will likely continue to impact the consumer demand for our indoor waterpark resort in that market and the operations of the resort 
because of triggering events that occurred in related to our sheboygan resort  including changes in the expectation of how long we will hold this property  current period and historical operating losses and the deterioration in the current market conditions  we performed a recoverability test of this resort to determine if further assessment for potential impairment was required 
based on this analysis of undiscounted cash flows  we determined the carrying value of this resort was not recoverable 
as a result  we recorded a  impairment charge to decrease the resort s carrying value to its estimated fair value net of estimated disposal costs in to determine the estimated fair value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge  we used a combination of historical and projected cash flows and other available market information  such as recent sales prices for similar assets 
although we believe our estimated fair value for the resort is reasonable  the actual fair value we ultimately realize from this resort could differ materially from this estimate 
the impaired long lived asset is included in our resort ownership operation segment 
goodwill we are required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
to test goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of the individual resort to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of that resort 
to estimate the resorts fair value we used a discounted cash flow model 
each of our resorts is considered a reporting unit 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the individual resort  we compare the implied fair value of the resort s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the individual resort to all the assets and liabilities of that resort as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the assessment date 
the excess of the fair value of the individual resort over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
our assessment of the fair value is dependent on the operating results of the resorts 
in we wrote off  of goodwill on our kansas city and mason resorts as the implied fair value of the goodwill  as discussed above  was deemed less than the carrying value 
as of december  and  we had no remaining goodwill balance 

table of contents balance as of january goodwill accumulated impairment losses goodwill related to sale of affiliate impairment losses balance as of december goodwill 
accumulated impairment losses goodwill related to sale of affiliate intangible assets we are required to assess indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying real estate assets could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these intangibles 
we had no impairment losses related to intangible assets in any of the periods presented 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  reflects approximately  of intangible assets related to our great wolf lodge brand name 
this brand name intangible asset has an indefinite life 
investments in affiliates when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate that the carrying value of our investments in affiliates may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
to test investment in affiliates for impairment  we compare the fair value of the investment in affiliates with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the investment in affiliates is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investments could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that continued adverse current and expected market conditions for our wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts indicated that our minority investment in the joint venture that owns these resorts may be impaired 
in early  we concluded that the fair value of our investment in this joint venture  as discussed above  was less than its carrying value 
as a result  we recorded an  impairment loss related to our interest in the joint venture that owns the wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts  as the implied fair value of the investment  as discussed above  was less than its carrying value 
on august   we sold our joint venture interest to cnl for  we do not believe current circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our minority investment in the joint venture that owns our grand mound resort may be impaired 
the carrying value of our interest in our joint venture that owns the great wolf lodge in grand mound is  as of december  accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income that could result from a sale of one or more of our resorts where there s a sales price in excess of tax basis  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  we would establish a valuation allowance which would increase the provision for income taxes 
conversely  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
in we determined that due to current conditions in the credit markets  real estate markets and our current financial position  the tax planning strategy we previously expected to generate substantial taxable income was no longer feasible 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of  in  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance we recorded is based on our estimates of taxable income solely from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and the period over which deferred tax assets reverse 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in a future period  we may need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated statement of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued guidance on how to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal market activity for the asset or liability 
in such situations  an entity may conclude that transactions or quoted prices may not be determinative of fair value  and may adjust the transactions or quoted prices to arrive at the fair value of the asset or liability 
this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   and shall be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual financial information for periods ending after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance which changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on  among other things  the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance 
the guidance will require a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
a reporting entity will be required to disclose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entity s financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the codification superseded all non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other nongrandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification will become nonauthoritative 
the guidance is effective for interim quarterly and annual periods beginning july  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued guidance on measuring liabilities at fair value which provides clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available 
the 
table of contents guidance was effective for the first reporting period beginning after issuance 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
this guidance eliminates the residual method under the current guidance and replaces it with the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price shall be used 
if neither exists for a deliverable  the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
after adoption  this guidance will also require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures 
the guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   although early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures we use ebitda as a measure of our operating performance 
ebitda is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ebitda consists of net income loss attributable to great wolf resorts  inc  eliminating a interest expense  net of interest income  b income tax expense or benefit and c depreciation and amortization 
ebitda as calculated by us is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
in addition  ebitda a does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  b is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash flow needs  and c should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or our other financial information as determined under gaap 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because a significant portion of our assets consists of property and equipment that are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in accordance with gaap 
because depreciation and amortization are non cash items  we believe that presentation of ebitda is a useful measure of our operating performance  it is widely used in the hospitality and entertainment industries to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  and we believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business  and as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions 
using a measure such as ebitda has material limitations  including the following it does not reflect every cash expenditure  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitment  it does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  
table of contents although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future  and our ebitda based measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements or improvements  it is not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows  it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  it does not reflect limitations on our costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us  and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as competitive measures 
because of these limitations  our ebitda based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 
we compensate for these limitations by using our ebitda based measures along with other comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of operating performance 
such gaap measurements include operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations and cash flow data 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including capital expenditures  interest payments  debt principal repayments  taxes and other non recurring charges  which are not reflected in our ebitda based measures 
our ebitda based measures are not intended as alternatives to net income loss as indicators of our operating performance  as alternatives to any other measure of performance in conformity with gaap or as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity 
you should therefore not place undue reliance on our ebitda based measures or ratios calculated using these measures 
our gaap based measures can be found in our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included elsewhere in this document 
the following table reconciles net loss attributable to great wolf resorts  inc to ebitda for the periods presented

we employ the staff at our managed properties 
under our management agreements  the resort owners reimburse us for payroll  benefits and certain other costs related to the operations of the managed properties 
we include the reimbursement of payroll  benefits and costs is recorded as revenue on our statements of operations  with a corresponding expense recorded as other expenses from managed properties 
operating expenses 
our departmental operating expenses consist of rooms  food and beverage and other department expenses 
our other operating expenses include the following items selling  general and administrative expenses  which are associated with the operations and management of resorts and which consist primarily of expenses such as corporate payroll and related benefits  operations management  sales and marketing  finance  legal  information technology support  human resources and other support services  as well as general corporate expenses  property operation and maintenance expenses  such as utility costs and property taxes  depreciation and amortization  and other expenses from managed properties 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following table shows key operating statistics for our resorts for the years ended december  and all properties a same store comparison b increase decrease occupancy n a adr revpar total revpor total revpar non rooms revenue per occupied room a includes results for properties that were open for any portion of the period  for all owned  managed and or licensed resorts

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had total indebtedness of  summarized as follows long term debt traverse city kansas city mortgage loan mason mortgage loan pocono mountains mortgage loan williamsburg mortgage loan grapevine mortgage loan concord construction loan junior subordinated debentures other debt city of sheboygan bonds city of sheboygan loan other traverse city kansas city mortgage loan this loan is secured by our traverse city and kansas city resorts 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of  is subject to a year principal amortization schedule  and matures in january the loan has customary financial and operating debt compliance covenants 
the loan also has customary restrictions on our ability to prepay the loan prior to maturity 
we were in compliance with all covenants under this loan at december  the loan requires us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio dscr of  calculated on a quarterly basis 
this ratio is defined as the two collateral properties combined trailing twelve month net operating income divided by the greater of i the loan s twelve month debt service requirements and ii of the amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness under the loan 
failure to meet the minimum dscr is not an event of default and does not accelerate the due date of the loan 
not meeting the minimum dscr  however  subjects the two properties to a lock box cash management arrangement  at the discretion of the loan s servicer 
we believe that the lock box arrangement would require substantially all cash receipts for the two resorts to be moved each day to a lender controlled bank account  which the loan servicer would then use to fund debt service and operating expenses for the two resorts 
for the year ended december   the dscr for this loan was 
as a result  the loan servicer may choose to implement the lock box cash management arrangement 
we believe that such an arrangement  if implemented  would constitute a traditional lock box arrangement as discussed in authoritative accounting guidance 
based on that guidance  if the loan servicer were to establish the traditional lock box arrangement now permitted under the loan  we believe we would be required to classify the entire outstanding principal balance of the loan as a current liability  since the lock box arrangement would require us to use the properties working capital to liquidate the loan and we do not presently have the ability to refinance this loan to a new  long term loan 
the loan also contains a similar lock box requirement if we open any great wolf lodge or blue harbor resort within miles of either resort  and the two collateral properties combined trailing twelve month net operating income is not at least equal to times of the amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness under the loan 
mason mortgage loan this loan is secured by our mason resort 
during  we extended the loan s maturity date to july  we incurred loan fees of  related to the extension of this loan 
the loan bears interest at a floating rate of day libor plus a spread of basis points with an interest rate floor of effective rate of as of december  
the loan requires principal amortization payments of  per quarter in and  per quarter thereafter 
this loan has customary financial and operating debt compliance covenants associated with an individual mortgaged property  including a minimum tangible net worth provision for great wolf resorts  inc we were in compliance with all covenants under this loan at december  
table of contents the loan also has a property level cash trap 
during those months that property yield is less than  excess cash is trapped in an escrow account and applied to any operating or debt service shortfalls  upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
twice a year  funds remaining in the escrow account that are not previously applied to any operating or debt service shortfalls  are applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
property yield is defined as the ratio of i net operating income divided by ii the sum of a the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus b any anticipated future funding excluding protective advances plus c accrued interest that remains unpaid for greater than days 
the loan has no restrictions on the repayment of loan principal and has exit fees payable upon full repayment of the loan or at maturity 
in addition  the owner of the mason resort is obligated to pay of the proceeds of certain liquidity events described below towards repayment of the mason mortgage loan  capped at  which amount is reduced as repayments of principal on the mason mortgage loan are periodically made 
the obligation to pay such proceeds is uncapped if the liquidity event involves a sale of the mason resort or of any direct or indirect interest in our subsidiary that owns the mason resort 
great wolf resorts  inc has guaranteed the entire amount of any required liquidity event paydown obligation  and up to  of the liquidity event paydown obligation is cross collateralized by our grapevine resort 
liquidity events include the sale of i any of our mason  concord or grapevine resorts  ii any direct or indrect equity interest in the mason  concord or grapevine resorts  iii a majority equity interest by great wolf resorts  inc or any of its majority owned or wholly owned subsidiaries in x any of such majority owned or wholly owned subsidiaries or y any of our existing properties that are wholly owned or majority owned  or the refinancing of a mortgage loan on any of our majority owned or wholly owned existing properties 
great wolf resorts  inc has also guaranteed all debt service obligations under the loan 
we are required to provide interest rate protection on a portion of the loan amount through the loan s maturity date 
therefore  we executed an interest rate cap payment in the amount of that caps the loan at interest 
this interest rate cap was designated as an ineffective cash flow hedge 
we mark the interest rate cap to market and record the change to interest expense 
pocono mountains mortgage loan this loan is secured by our pocono mountains resort 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of and matures in december the loan is currently subject to a year principal amortization schedule 
the loan has customary covenants associated with an individual mortgaged property 
the loan also has customary restrictions on our ability to prepay the loan prior to maturity 
we were in compliance with all covenants under this loan at december  the loan requires us to maintain a minimum dscr of  calculated on a quarterly basis 
subject to certain exceptions  the dscr is increased to if we open up a waterpark resort within miles of the property or incur mezzanine debt secured by the resort 
this ratio is defined as the property s combined trailing twelve month net operating income divided by the greater of i the loan s twelve month debt service requirements and ii of the amount of the outstanding principal indebtedness under the loan 
failure to meet the minimum dscr is not an event of default and does not accelerate the due date of the loan 
not meeting the minimum dscr  however  subjects the property to a lock box cash management arrangement  at the discretion of the loan s servicer 
we believe that lock box arrangement would require substantially all cash receipts for the resort to be moved each day to a lender controlled bank account  which the loan servicer would then use to fund debt service and operating expenses for the resort  with excess cash flow being deposited in a reserve account and held as additional collateral for the loan 
while recourse under the loan is limited to the property owner s interest in the mortgage property  we have provided limited guarantees with respect to certain customary non recourse provisions and environmental indemnities relating to the loan

we were in compliance with all covenants under this loan at december  the loan also has a property level cash trap 
commencing upon the third payment date after it has been determined that a cash sweep condition exists  and continuing for two payment dates thereafter  
table of contents the borrower must pay  in addition to other amounts due  excess cash subject to certain limitations  which must be applied towards the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
cash sweep conditions include i the failure to maintain a dscr of to  ii the failure of great wolf resorts  inc and its subsidiaries  on a consolidated basis  to maintain liquidity of at least  and iii the failure of great wolf  resorts  inc and its subsidiaries  on a consolidated basis  to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of in conjunction with the closing of this loan  we were required to provide interest rate protection on a portion of the loan amount through the loan s maturity date 
therefore  we executed an interest rate cap payment in the amount of that caps the loan at interest through the loan s maturity date 
this interest rate cap was designated as an ineffective cash flow hedge

the loan has no restrictions on the repayment of loan principal and has exit fees that must be paid upon full repayment of the loan or at maturity 
we were in compliance with all covenants under this loan at december  we are required to provide interest rate protection on a portion of the loan amount through the loan s maturity date

concord construction loan in april we closed on a  construction loan to fund a portion of the total costs of our great wolf lodge resort in concord 
the loan  which matures in april  was expanded to its  maximum principal amount in january the loan had an aggregate outstanding principal amount of  as of december  the loan requires monthly amortization payments of a year basis beginning on september  the loan bears interest at a floating annual rate of libor plus a spread of basis points  with a minimum rate of per annum effective rate of as of december  
the loan requires interest only payments until the one year anniversary of the conversion date of the property and then requires monthly principal payments based on a year amortization schedule 
however  if after the conversion date that is  after a certificate of occupancy for the project  but in no event after april  the resort owner s net income available to pay debt service on this loan for four consecutive quarters is less than million  or if maximum principal amount of the loan exceeds of the fair market value of the property  then we are required to post cash collateral or partially repay the loan in an amount sufficient to remedy such deficiency 
this loan has customary financial and operating debt compliance covenants associated with an individual mortgaged property  including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth provision 
we were in compliance with all covenants under this loan at december  great wolf resorts  inc has provided a  payment guaranty of the loan on our concord  north carolina resort property 
if our subsidiary defaults on this obligation we would be required to assume that obligation  including the payment of any outstanding debt amounts 
if we are required to undertake such obligation  it may have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

issue trusts  like trust i and trust iii collectively  the trusts  are generally variable interests 
we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary under the trusts  and accordingly we do not include the financial statements of the trusts in our consolidated financial statements 
based on the foregoing accounting authority  our consolidated financial statements present the debentures issued to the trusts as long term debt

city of sheboygan bonds the city of sheboygan the city bonds represent the face amount of bond anticipation notes bans issued by the city in november in conjunction with the construction of the blue harbor resort in sheboygan  wisconsin

we have an obligation to fund certain minimum guaranteed amounts of room tax payments to be made by the blue harbor resort through  which obligation is indirectly related to the payments by the city on the bans 
city of sheboygan loan the city of sheboygan loan amount represents a loan made by the city in in conjunction with the construction of the blue harbor resort in sheboygan  wisconsin 
the loan is noninterest bearing and matures in our obligation to repay the loan will be satisfied by certain minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments to be made by the blue harbor resort through future maturities future principal requirements on long term debt as of december  are as follows thereafter total 
table of contents short term liquidity requirements our short term liquidity requirements generally consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses for the next months  including recurring maintenance  repairs and other operating expenses necessary to properly maintain and operate our resorts  recurring capital expenditures we make at our resorts  debt maturities within the next year  property taxes and insurance expenses  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  general and administrative expenses  and income taxes 
historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through a combination of operating cash flows and cash on hand 
we believe that cash provided by our operations  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service for the next months 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements generally consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the following items for periods beyond the next months scheduled debt maturities  costs associated with the development of new resorts  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our resorts  and capital contributions and loans to unconsolidated joint ventures 
we expect to meet these needs through a combination of existing working capital deficit  cash provided by operations  proceeds from investing activities  including sales of partial or whole ownership interests in certain of our resorts  and proceeds from financing activities  including mortgage financing on properties being developed  additional or replacement borrowings under future credit facilities  contributions from joint venture partners  and the issuance of equity instruments  including common stock  or additional or replacement debt  including debt securities  as market conditions permit 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 
we cannot be certain  however  that we will have access to financing sufficient to meet our long term liquidity requirements on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
our largest long term expenditures other than debt maturities are expected to be for capital expenditures for development of future resorts  non routine capital expenditures for our existing resorts  and capital contributions or loans to joint ventures owning resorts under construction or development 
such expenditures were  for the year ended december  we expect to have approximately  of such expenditures for as discussed above  we expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations and cash on hand 

table of contents we currently project that the combination of our cash on hand plus cash provided by operations in will be sufficient to meet the short term liquidity requirements  as described above 
based on our current projections  however  we do not believe that we will have sufficient excess amounts of cash available in in order either to begin development of any resort we would wholly own  although we expect to have cash available for minimal capital contributions to new joint ventures that would develop resorts that we would license and or manage 
also  due to the current state of the capital markets  which are marked by the general unavailability of debt financing for large commercial real estate construction projects  we do not expect to have significant expenditures for development of new resorts until we have all equity and debt capital amounts fully committed  including our projected ability to fund our required equity contribution to a project 
we believe this may result in our not making any significant expenditures in for development of new resorts or capital contributions to new joint ventures that develop future resorts 
off balance sheet arrangements in august we sold our joint venture interest in the joint venture that owns two resorts  great wolf lodge wisconsin dells  wisconsin and great wolf lodge sandusky  ohio to cnl lifestyle properties  inc we currently manage both properties and license the great wolf lodge brand to the joint venture 
we have one unconsolidated joint venture arrangement at december  we account for our unconsolidated joint venture using the equity method of accounting 
our joint venture with the confederated tribes of the chehalis reservation owns the great wolf lodge resort and conference center on a acre land parcel in grand mound  washington 
this resort opened in march this joint venture is a limited liability company 
we are a member of that limited liability company with a ownership interest 
at december   the joint venture had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of  as of december   we have made combined loan and equity contributions  net of loan repayments  of  to the joint venture to fund a portion of construction costs of the resort 
in january  the other member of the joint venture purchased  of our loan at par 
based on the nature of the activities conducted in the joint venture  we cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy amounts that we may be required to fund in the long term 
we do not currently believe that any additional future funding of the joint venture will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  as we currently do not expect to make any significant future capital contributions to this joint venture 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment terms less than more than total year years years years debt obligations operating lease obligations reserve on unrecognized tax benefits total amounts include interest for fixed rate debt and principal 
they also include  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by our sheboygan resort 
if we develop future resorts where we are the majority owner  we expect to incur significant additional debt and construction contract obligations 

table of contents working capital we had  of available cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  current assets less current liabilities at december   compared to the  of available cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  at december  the primary reasons for the working capital deficit is the use of cash for capital expenditures and investments in and advances to affiliates and for our properties that were under development 
cash flows comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from a decrease in operating income  deferred tax benefit  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities during the year ended december  as compared to december  investing activities 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted primarily from a decrease in contributions to our investments in affiliates  proceeds from the sale of our interest in a joint venture  as well as an increase in loan repayments received from our affiliate 
this decrease is also due to a decrease in capital expenditures related to our properties that are in service and in development 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from receiving fewer loan proceeds during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates  during the year ended december  as compared to december  investing activities 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted primarily from decreased capital expenditures for our properties that are in service and under development  a decrease in cash used to fund our investments in unconsolidated affiliates  and the receipt of payments on a loan from one of our joint ventures 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the proceeds from our williamsburg loan during the year ended december  the increase from the loan proceeds were offset partially by an increase in principal payments and loan costs 
inflation our resort properties are able to change room and amenity rates on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation can often be passed along to customers 
however  a weak economic environment that decreases 
table of contents overall demand for our products and services could restrict our ability to raise room and amenity rates to offset rising costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent  in part  upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our earnings are also affected by the changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from cash and short term investments  and our interest expense from variable rate debt instruments 
we may use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we do not intend to use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately  this debt consisted of  of fixed rate debt secured by two of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at 
 of variable rate debt secured by one of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at a floating rate of day libor plus a spread of basis points  with a minimum rate of per annum 
the effective rate was at december   of fixed rate debt secured by one of our resorts

the securities mature in march  of subordinated debentures that bear interest at a fixed rate of through june and then at a floating rate of libor plus basis points thereafter 
the securities mature in june  of fixed rate debt effective interest rate of recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of noninterest bearing debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by the sheboygan resort 
related to a capital lease that was entered into in june the lease matures in may as of december   we estimate the total fair value of the indebtedness described above to be  less than its total carrying values  due to the terms of the existing debt being different than those terms we believe would currently be available to us for indebtedness with similar risks and remaining maturities 
at december   all of our variable rate debt is subject to minimum rate floors 
if libor were to increase or decrease by that is  basis points  there would be no change in interest expense on our variable rate debt based on our debt balances outstanding and current interest rates in effect as of december   as that libor increase or decrease would have no effect on the minimum rate floors for the loans
