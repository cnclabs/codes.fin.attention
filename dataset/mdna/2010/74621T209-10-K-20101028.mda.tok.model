the financial statements presented herein  and discussed below  have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
overview pure bioscience sometimes referred to herein as the company  we  us or our was incorporated in the state of california on august  as innovative medical services 
in september  we changed our name from innovative medical services to pure bioscience 
we began as a provider of pharmaceutical water purification products for the pharmacy market  however we divested all assets associated with this business in the sale  in may  of our water treatment division 
in  we commenced investments in the development of novel bioscience technologies  and subsequent to may we have been exclusively focused on the development and commercialization of our current and future bioscience products 
we are expanding into markets with broad potential by developing new  proprietary bioscience products based upon our patented silver ion antimicrobial technologies 
we are developing technology based products  including our silver dihydrogen citrate based antimicrobials  which we believe can provide novel  non toxic solutions to numerous global health challenges and represent innovative advances in diverse markets 
we believe that our technologies are in a position to contribute significantly to today s global trend toward industrial and consumer use of environmentally friendly products  while providing competitive advantages in efficacy and safety 
bioscience technologies our flagship bioscience technology is a patented  aqueous antimicrobial called silver dihydrogen citrate sdc 
a novel molecular entity  sdc is an electrolytically generated source of stabilized ionic silver that can serve as the basis for a broad range of products in diverse markets 
sdc liquid is colorless  odorless  tasteless  non caustic and formulates well with other compounds 
we believe that our sdc based antimicrobial is distinguished from competitors in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy combined with reduced toxicity 
we are producing pre formulated  ready to use products for both our own brands and for private label distribution  as well as varying strengths of sdc concentrate as an additive or raw material for inclusion in other companies products 
we are also producing sdc a s an active pharmaceutical ingredient api  currently in clinical trials for multiple indications 
in addition to sdc  we have obtained patent protection for ionic silver based molecular entities utilizing organic acids other than citric acid 
sources of revenue our principal sources of revenue are comprised of sales of sdc concentrate as well as both bulk and individually bottled sdc based hard surface disinfectants 
we sell sdc in a variety of concentrations and formulations to certain partners and distributors who in turn i resell the concentrate as an active ingredient or preservative in other companies products  ii blend the product into hard surface disinfectant products for sale to retail  commercial and institutional customers  and or iii develop novel formulations under a license granted by us 
in addition  we sell both bulk and individually bottled hard surface disinfectant products  both directly and through distributors  to retail  commercial and institutional customers 
in prior years  customers purchasing our epa approved disinfectants were primarily distributors who sell such products under their own labels as a sub registrant of our epa master label  however during our fiscal year ended july  fiscal we commenced selling our epa approved hard surface disinfectants  to commercial distributors and commercial customers  under our own label  iv ultimate germ defense iv through an alliance with a dallas based sales and marketing organization  richmont sciences  llc richmont  to commercial distributors and commercial customers 
under our arrangement with richmont  we recognize revenues for products sold to third parties  and pay marketing fees to richmont based upon those revenues 
we recognized revenue from the fir st sales of iv under this agreement in fiscal in may  iv was launched direct to consumers via a direct sales channel  by a newly formed company called iv direct  an affiliate of richmont 
we sell finished products at contracted unit prices to iv direct  for iv direct to resell through a network of independent sales associates using a multi level sales model 
our revenue for fiscal includes the sale to iv direct of finished products for the direct sales channel 
pure bioscience does not have an equity interest in either iv direct or richmont 
we also sell sdc concentrate to basf  who in turn resells the concentrate under basf s own brand names within the global personal care  household and institutional markets 
basf currently sells our sdc concentrate on a non exclusive basis within these markets 
in july  we entered into a development and licensing agreement for sdc based products for human use with fta bioscience  llc fta 
under our agreement with fta  fta is funding and directing all development activities and fda regulatory filings 
in july  based on preclinical data developed by fta  we granted two product specific licenses to fta for the development of an sdc based treatment for tinea unguium  also referred to as onychomycosis nail fungus  as well as for tinea pedis athlete s foot  for which we recognized the first milestone payments under the agreement 
during fiscal  sales to each of basf and harmony bioscience  our distributor in asia of hard surface disinfectant products to asia  comprised or more of our revenues 
of product sales for the year were made to us domestic customers 
the balance of future revenues by territory is unknown at this time  however we expect the united states market to continue to be our largest market for the foreseeable future 
because the development of our sdc technology is at an early stage of development and commercialization  it is difficult to predict our revenues 
our historical revenues have fluctuated from period to period based on factors that include  but are not limited to  the timing of regulatory approvals regarding our and our partners products containing sdc  the timing of product launches by both our strategic partners and  in some cases  their customers and partners  the timing of our entry into new strategic agreements  and the quantities of our products required by our partners to effect new research programs and product launches 
cost of revenues and operating expenses costs of revenue 
costs of product revenue includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture products  including materials consumed  manufacturing overheads  shipping costs  salaries  benefits  and related expenses of our operations  and  during fiscal  costs incurred to have products bottled and labeled by a third party 
in addition  included in our inventory of finished goods as of july  and were approximately  and  gallons of sdc concentrate  respectively  that we purchased from an unrelated third party in a lien sale see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this transaction 
this transaction had the effect of reducing our cost of goods sold below our cost of goods m anufactured during fiscal  and this will continue until the balance of this sdc concentrate is consumed in manufacturing  or sold 
gross profit on product sales represents net revenue less the costs of revenue 
our gross profit percentage is highly dependent on pricing  contractual agreements  product mix  customer mix  and other factors 
we do not believe that historical gross profit margins on product sales are a reliable indicator of future gross profit margins 
during our fiscal year ended july  fiscal  we recorded  of licensing revenue in connection with the expiration of an agreement whereby we allowed a third party a limited time period to exclusively evaluate our sdc technology 
cost of goods sold related to this revenue was zero  as we did not incur any costs directly related to our commitments under the agreement 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  and amounts paid to third party providers for marketing  sales  public relations and advertising  along with promotional and trade show costs and travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses also include share based compensation allocable to employees and third party advisors performing services related to sales and marketing 
under our agreement with richmont  we pay marketing fees to richmont and record such fees as selling expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include employee salaries and benefits  and amounts paid to third party providers for finance and accounting  legal  human resources  insurance  information technology  and other administrative activities 
general and administrative expenses also include share based compensation allocable to employees and third party advisors performing general and administrative services 
research and development 
research and development costs include in house research costs  expenditures for third party testing  patent amortization  outside legal costs for maintaining issued patents  and product registration expenditures 
we do not currently expect our research and development expense to grow significantly in future periods  however if opportunities arise  particularly in the development and testing of new formulations  we will evaluate the need for additional research expenditures based on potential market sizes and our estimation of the likelihood of our technology achieving successful results 
research and development expenses also include share based compensation allocable to employees and third party advisors performing services related to research and development 
critical accounting policies accounting for long lived assets intangible assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  consisting of property  plant  equipment and finite lived intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or circumstances include an asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used in operations is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
the factors used to evaluate the future net cash flows  while reasonable  require a high degree of judgment and the results could vary if the actual results are materially different than the forecasts 
in addition  we base useful lives and amortization or depreciation expense on our subjective estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value le ss selling costs 
we also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after august  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of applicable authoritative guidance 
specifically  we estimate the weighted average fair value of options granted using the black scholes option pricing model based on evaluation assumptions regarding expected volatility  dividend yield  risk free interest rates  the expected term of the option and the expected forfeiture rate 
each of these assumptions  while reasonable  requires a certain degree of judgment and the fair value estimates could vary if the actual results are materially different than those initially applied 
prior to august   we were not required to record compensation cost in the consolidated financial statements for stock options issued to employees or directors 
subsequently  the estimated grant date fair value of such awards is expensed over the applicable service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
we do not have any stock option awards with market or performance conditions 
the fair value of stock options granted to non employees is expensed over the applicable service period 
such options are revalued quarterly until fully vested 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance providing a one year deferral of the effective date of fair market value measurement for non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
effective august   we implemented the guidance for non financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured at fair value on a non recurring basis 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we continue to evaluate the impact of the guidance  if any  on our consolidated financial statements for future periods 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it also clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
it also changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented  requires additional disclosures  and requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the guidance became effective for us as of august   however  it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of the position is to improve the consistency between previously existing standards 
the guidance became effective for us as of august   however  it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified authoritative guidance providing a framework for determining whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions  in order to determine whether the instrument should be classified as an equity instrument or a derivative instrument 
the guidance became effective for us as of august  we have performed an evaluation of our equity linked financial instruments that are subject to the guidance  including outstanding common stock warrants  and determined that they should be classified as equity within the consolidated balance sheets 
the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities  to require an issuer to perform an analysis to determine whether the issuer s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  if any 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as one with the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest 
the guidance will be effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period commencing after november  our fiscal year ending july  fiscal 
w e will assess the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements when this guidance becomes effective for us 
in june  the fasb issued accounting guidance which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification is non authoritative 
this guidance became effective for us as of our fiscal quarter ended october  the codification does not change gaap and did not impact our financial positi on or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued new authoritative guidance for the fair value measurement of liabilities when a quoted price in an active market is not available 
the guidance became effective for us as of november   however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides additional guidance on using the net asset value per share  provided by an investee  when estimating the fair value of an alternate investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value  and enhances the disclosures concerning these investments 
examples of alternate investments that fall within the scope of this standard include investments in hedge funds and private equity  real estate  and venture capital partnerships 
the guidance became effective for us as of november   however  we do not currently have any investments that fall within the scope of this new guidance  and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the new guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after ju ne  our fiscal 
we do not currently expect the implementation of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the new guidance also requires a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
the new guidance is effective at the start of a reporting entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  our fiscal 
we do not currently expect the implementation of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires new disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
the new guidance requires a reporting entity to disclose significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  to describe the reasons for the transfers and to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
we adopted the guidance in the third quarter of fiscal  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  our fiscal quarter ending april  
the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and we do not currently expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
in february  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance regarding the reporting of subsequent events  removing the requirement for an issuer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the guidance was effective upon issuance in february  and was adopted as of our report on form q for the three months ended january  as filed with the sec on march  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
the guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  our fiscal quarter ending october  
we will assess the impact  if any  of the adoption of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements when this guidance becomes effective for us  however we do not currently believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for fiscal versus fiscal revenue and gross margin for fiscal  product revenues of  increased by  compared with comparable revenues of  in fiscal our customers have historically been primarily strategic partners  such as basf  who develop products containing our sdc technology  and distributors who sell our hard surface disinfectants under their own labels 
however  in fiscal we commenced selling our own epa approved hard surface disinfectant under our own label  iv ultimate germ defense iv through an alliance with a dallas based sales and marketing organization  richmont sciences  llc richmont  to commercial distributors and commercial customers 
under this agreement with richmont  we recognize revenues for products sold to third parties  and pay marketing fees to richmont based upon those revenues 
additionally in fiscal  iv was launched direct to consumers via a direct sales channel  by a new ly formed company called iv direct  an affiliate of richmont 
we sell finished products at contracted unit prices to iv direct  for iv direct to resell through a network of independent sales associates using a multi level sales model 
our revenue for fiscal includes the sale to iv direct of finished products for the direct sales channel 
in february  san diego based carefusion corporation purchased  two ounce bottles of our iv water purifier  a concentrate product  for shipment to project hope for distribution in earthquake ravaged areas of haiti  for which we recorded revenue in fiscal in fiscal  of product sales were made to five customers  with sales to basf and harmony bioscience  our distributor of hard surface disinfectant products to asia  each comprising more than of our revenues 
of product revenue for fiscal was derived from sales made to us domestic customers and from sales made to international customers 
in fiscal  of product sales were made to five customers  of product sales were made to us domestic customers and were made to international customers 
we differentiate sales between domestic and international based on the country to which we first ship products 
in fiscal  of product sales were derived from sales of bulk ready to use disinfectant or finished packaged products containing our ready to use disinfectant  and of our product sales were of bulk sdc concentrate 
in fiscal  of our revenue was derived from bulk ready to use disinfectant or finished packaged products containing our ready to use disinfectant 
gross profit on product sales for fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal the gross margin percentage for fiscal was  compared with in fiscal this improvement is primarily due to a higher proportion of concentrate sold in the most recent year  and a reduced proportion of bottled products which are generally sold at lower margins 
in fiscal  we recognized  in licensing revenue pursuant to our agreement with fta bioscience  llc 
in fiscal  we recorded licensing revenue of  pursuant to an agreement whereby we allowed a third party a limited time period to exclusively evaluate our sdc technology 
cost of goods sold related to licensing revenue was zero in each of fiscal and  as we did not incur any costs directly related to our commitments under the respective agreements 
operating costs operating costs increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal within these aggregate operating costs  selling expenses increased by  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in selling expenses is primarily due to an increase in non cash stock option expense of  and increases in payroll and public relations expense 
general and administrative expense declined by  from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal included in general and administrative expense for fiscal was  of bad debt expense  whereas we did not record any bad debt expense in fiscal additionally  legal fees declined by  year over year  and accounting costs declined by  these reductions were offset by an increase of  in stock option and restricted stock expense  due primarily to the revaluation of stock options previously issued to consultants  stock option grants made to both new and existing non officer employees  and to a change in practice for officer and director grants 
in may  we granted stock option and restricted stock awards to officers and directors which are subject to v esting provisions  whereas prior practice had been for such awards to vest immediately 
awards with vesting provisions are expensed over the vesting period  rather than on their date of grant 
additionally  facility operating costs increased year over year  partially due to new warehousing space leased during fiscal research and development costs  including in house costs  patent amortization  outside legal costs for maintaining approved patents  and product registration expenditures  increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase of  in payroll and related expense from new hires in our research and development department 
additionally  stock option expense increased by  and third party testing costs were also higher in fiscal than in fiscal these increases were partially offset by declines in consulting and product registration expense 
we do not currently expect our research and development expense to grow significantly in future periods  however if opportunities arise  particularly in the developm ent and testing of new formulations  we will evaluate the need for additional research expenditures based on potential market sizes  our estimation of the likelihood of our technology achieving successful results  and the availability of working capital 
in fiscal  we wrote down the value of a manufacturing development project that had been previously capitalized  and recorded  as impairment of capitalized assets within the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal our loss from operations declined by  from a loss of  for fiscal to a loss of  for fiscal other income other income increased by  to  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due primarily to the receipt of  from a legal settlement during fiscal this income was partially offset by gains on the sale of us treasury bills in fiscal income taxes income tax expense for fiscal was  and for fiscal was  the minimum state franchise taxes we pay regardless of income or loss 
all other federal or state tax liabilities were offset by current period losses or available federal and california net operating loss carry forwards 
in june  authoritative guidance was issued which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the authoritative guidance also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
pursuant to the guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from any tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of any such position 
the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for fiscal or  as we had no unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
our practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense  however we had no accrued interest or penalties at either august  or july  at july   we had federal and california tax net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
realization of our deferred tax assets  which relate to operating loss carry forwards and timing differences  is dependent on future earnings 
the timing and amount of future earnings are uncertain  and therefore we establish a full valuation allowance 
net loss our net loss after taxes declined by  from a net loss of  or per share for fiscal to a net loss of  or per share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources fiscal vs 
fiscal since the sale of our water treatment division in may  we have financed our working capital primarily through sales of our common stock 
at july   we had cash and cash equivalents of  no short term investments  and no long term debt 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  on october   we closed a transaction whereby we sold  of our common stock in an unregistered private placement solely to non affiliated accredited investors 
under the terms of the private placement  we sold  shares of restricted common stock at a price of per share 
no warrants were issued in the transaction  which was completed directly by the company without any underwriter or placement agent 
after expenses  the net proceeds are expected to be approximately  which will be used for working capital 
net cash used in operations in fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal the decline in operating cash expenditures  of  is primarily due to increased collections  reduced general and administrative spending  and the receipt of  from a legal settlement during fiscal  partially offset by increased selling and research and development spending  and an increase of  in inventory 
at july   we had no short term investments and no long term debt 
total current assets at july  were  a decline of  from july  in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was  consisting of investments in patents of  and purchases of property  plant and equipment of  at july   the net value of our capitalized patents and our property  plant and equipment was  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash provided by investing activities was  investments in patents of  and purchases of property  plant and equipment of  were offset by a net amount cash sales less cash purchases of  provided by short term investments 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was   of which was derived from the net proceeds in september of a registered direct offering in which we sold million of our common stock and warrants to institutional investors 
in addition  of the cash provided by financing activities in fiscal   was provided by proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock  and  was provided by proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was   of which was derived from the net proceeds in may of a registered direct offering in which we sold million of our common stock and warrants to institutional investors 
in addition  of the cash provided by financing activities in fiscal   was provided by proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock  and  was provided by proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
at july   we had total liabilities of  an increase of  from july  future cash needs during the next twelve months  we anticipate making significant investments in manufacturing processes  in regulatory applications for new products or additional claims  in our corporate and business development infrastructure  and in programs required for us to maintain our compliance with securities laws as well as the listing standards of the nasdaq capital market  among other investments 
we believe  however  that our cash resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated needs during the next twelve months 
our assessment is based on historical working capital needs  operating loss trends  and our current business outlook 
in future periods we may need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt  equity  convertible securities or through other means  any one of which could reduce the value to us  perhaps substantially  of our technology and its commercial potential 
we currently have no long term debt  however the issuance of debt  equity or convertible securities in future periods  if any  could lead to the dilution of our existing shareholders 
there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
insufficient funds could cause us to fail to execute our business plan  fail to take advantage of future opportunities  or fail to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated consumer requirements  and further may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  license to third parties the right to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise commercialize ourselves  or to reduce or cease operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total item a
