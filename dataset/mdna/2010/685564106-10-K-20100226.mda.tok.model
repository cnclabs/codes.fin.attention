overview introduction orbital sciences corporation is principally engaged in the development and manufacture of small and medium class rockets and space systems for commercial  military and civil government customers 
our primary products and services include the following launch vehicles 
rockets that are used as interceptor and target vehicles for missile defense systems  small and medium class space launch vehicles that place satellites into earth orbit and escape trajectories  and suborbital launch vehicles that place payloads into a variety of high altitude trajectories 
satellites and space systems 
small and medium class spacecraft that are used to enable global and regional communications and broadcasting  conduct space related scientific research  carry out interplanetary and other deep space exploration missions  enable national security applications  collect imagery and other remotely sensed data about the earth and to demonstrate new space technologies 
advanced space programs 
human rated space systems for earth orbit and lunar exploration  and small satellites and satellite subsystems primarily used for national security space programs and to demonstrate new space technologies 
our general strategy is to develop and expand a core offering of space and launch system technologies and products  focusing on affordable rockets  satellites and other space systems in order to establish and expand positions in niche markets that have not typically been emphasized by our larger competitors 
another part of our strategy is to seek customer contracts that will fund new product development and enhancements to our existing launch vehicle and space systems product lines 
as a result of our capabilities and substantial experience in designing  developing  manufacturing and operating a broad range of small and medium class rockets and space systems  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the demand for more affordable space technology systems in missile defense  space based military and intelligence operations  and commercial satellite communications programs  and to take advantage of government sponsored initiatives for human space exploration  space based scientific research and interplanetary exploration 

table of contents business and industry considerations us government business during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total annual revenues were derived from contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with other us government prime contractors 
most of our us government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
as a result  our operating performance in any period is impacted substantially by trends in us government spending  shifting priorities in dod  mda  nasa and other agency budgets  the types of contracts and payment terms mandated by the us government  and changes in the executive branch and congress 
these factors  which are largely beyond our control  could have a significant impact on our business 
with the change in in presidential administrations  the us government spending priorities on defense and civil space programs have shifted from what the trends had been over the past years 
our largest us government program in recent years  and the largest contributor to revenues in our launch vehicles business segment  has been work as a major subcontractor on mda s gmd program 
while the fiscal year and proposed fiscal year federal budgets continue to provide substantial funding for mda and other agencies within dod  they reflect a priority shift away from long range threats  such as those addressed by the gmd program  towards missile systems with near term short and medium range capability 
dod and its various agencies are still in the process of defining mission requirements and program budgets to reflect this change 
while the gmd interceptor will continue to be funded  although at reduced levels compared to previous years  we believe the capabilities of our wide range of target launch vehicle product lines could meet the requirements of a variety of national missile defense systems 
the timing  requirements and magnitude of new procurements  however  remain uncertain 
the obama administration has introduced a new direction for the country s civil space program  as reflected in its proposed fiscal year budget and a five year plan that increases nasa s funding by billion to stimulate the development of advanced technologies including human spaceflight and exploration programs as well as earth and space science investigations 
the decision to extend us participation in the iss program until at least should strengthen current initiatives in commercial cargo deliveries to the iss 
in  we expect that nasa s crs program  a fixed price billion contract awarded to us by nasa in  will become our largest us government program 
the obama administration has also requested increases to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa fiscal year budget  which proposes to increase spending on new weather satellites and funding for new opportunities for private sector providers to place climate sensors on commercial satellite platforms 

table of contents despite our generally favorable outlook with respect to our us government business  future government spending is subject to a number of uncertainties  particularly in light of the current economic conditions 
future us government funding for defense and space exploration  including in connection with our programs described above  may be negatively affected by federal budgetary constraints beyond our control and the redeployment of federal funds for various economic and other initiatives 
commercial communications satellites business our largest commercial business is the design and manufacture of small class geo communications satellites 
in  communications satellites accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
the commercial communications satellite market is driven by economic conditions that may affect satellite operators as well as satellite replacement needs 
the majority of geo communications satellites are still medium class and large class satellites 
in  commercial satellite orders reached their highest level since  with total satellite orders worldwide for all satellite classes 
seven orders were for small satellites  of which four were awarded to us 
we believe the growth in satellite orders reflects the need of commercial operators to replace aging fleets of communications satellites as well as growing worldwide demand for satellite based communications services 
us government agencies also are now viewing commercial satellites as a potential platform for government payloads that can be hosted on a commercial platform and thus be launched and operated at a much lower cost than a dedicated government satellite and associated launch vehicle 
taurus ii and cots research and development projects since  we have been engaged in a major new product development effort 
we are developing the taurus ii medium capacity rocket  that will substantially increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicle platforms 
in  we entered into an agreement with nasa to design  build and demonstrate a new space transportation system under the cots program that has the capability to deliver cargo and other supplies to the iss 
our total research and development expenses in totaled of our consolidated revenues and primarily related to the taurus ii and cots programs 
we believe that we will continue to incur significant research and development expenses and consume substantial amounts of cash on the taurus ii and cots development efforts in and our taurus ii launch vehicle and the cygnus advanced maneuvering spacecraft that we are developing for the cots demonstration mission are planned for use in the performance of our crs contract with nasa 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences may be material 

table of contents the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue is derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operations as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and operating profits from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
many of our contracts include provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on performance against established targets 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based upon historical experience and other objective criteria 
if performance under such contracts were to differ from previous assumptions  current period revenues and profits would be adjusted and could fluctuate significantly 
as of december  and december   unbilled receivables included million and million  respectively  of incentive fees on certain completed satellite contracts that become due incrementally over periods of up to years  subject to the achievement of performance criteria 
certain satellite contracts require us to refund cash to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied 
through december   we have recognized approximately million of revenues under such contracts  a portion or all of which could be reversed in future periods if satellite performance criteria are not met 
we generally procure annual insurance policies that we believe would indemnify us for satellite incentive fees that are not earned and for performance refund obligations 
through december   we have recognized approximately million of estimated award fees on the orion contract that are subject to a final assessment at the conclusion of the contract 
if the final award fee assessment is different than the interim assessments  we will be required to record a revenue and profit adjustment in future periods 

table of contents inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
cost is determined on an average cost or specific identification basis 
estimated market value is determined based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were less favorable than those previously projected by management  inventory write downs could be required 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
expenditures for company sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred 
research and development projects performed under contracts for customers are recorded as contract costs 
in we entered into the cots agreement with nasa to design  build and demonstrate a new space transportation system for delivering cargo and supplies to the iss 
the cots agreement is being accounted for as a best efforts research and development cost sharing arrangement 
as such  the amounts funded by nasa are recognized proportionally as an offset to our cots project research and development expenses  including associated general and administrative expenses 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and retrospective application of new accounting standard as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  our financial statements in and prior years have been adjusted as required by a new accounting standard that requires us to separately account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt 
as a result  we recorded additional non cash interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  attributable to the amortization of debt discount 
revenues our consolidated revenues were  million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to due to lower revenues in the satellites and space systems and launch vehicles business segments  partially offset by higher revenues in the advanced space programs business segment 
satellites and space systems segment revenues declined million  or  primarily due to decreased activity on communications satellite contracts as a result of the substantial completion of certain satellites 
launch vehicles segment revenues declined million  or  primarily as a result of the termination of the kinetic energy 
table of contents interceptor kei program by mda in the second quarter of and decreased activity on the gmd missile defense program 
advanced space programs segment revenues increased million  or  due to increased activity on the crs contract and national security satellite contracts  partially offset by a reduction in activity on the orion human spacecraft program 
our consolidated revenues were  million in  an increase of million  or  compared to due to revenue growth in the advanced space programs and launch vehicles business segments  partially offset by lower revenues in the satellites and space systems segment 
advanced space programs segment revenues grew million  or  primarily due to increased activity on national security satellite programs and the orion program 
launch vehicles segment revenues grew million  or  primarily due to increased activity on missile defense and space launch vehicle contracts 
satellites and space systems segment revenues declined million  or  primarily due to decreased activity on communications satellite and science and technology satellite contracts due to the substantial completion of certain satellites since cost of revenues our cost of revenues was million in  a decrease of million  or compared to cost of revenues includes the costs of personnel  materials  subcontractors and overhead 
the decrease in cost of revenues was principally due to the decreased level of contract activity that was consistent with the revenue decreases discussed above in the satellites and space systems and launch vehicles business segments  offset partially by increased activity in the advanced space programs segment 
cost of revenues in the satellites and space systems segment decreased million  or  in compared to cost of revenues in the launch vehicles segment decreased million  or  in cost of revenues in the advanced space programs segment increased million  or  in our cost of revenues was million in  an increase of million  or compared to this increase in cost of revenues was mainly due to the increased level of contract activity that was consistent with the revenue growth discussed above in the advanced space programs and launch vehicles segments  offset by a decrease in revenues in the satellites and space systems segment 
cost of revenues in the advanced space programs segment increased million  or  in compared to cost of revenues in the launch vehicles segment increased million  or  in cost of revenues in the satellites and space systems segment decreased million  or  in research and development expenses our research and development expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in  a million increase compared to million  or of revenues  in our research and development expenses in were million  or of revenues 
these annual increases in research and development expenses were primarily due to our taurus ii launch vehicle development program and the cots demonstration mission 
in  and  approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of our research and development expenses were attributable to the taurus ii program 
under the cots agreement  nasa has agreed to pay us million  partially 
table of contents funding our cots project costs which are currently estimated to be approximately million 
the cots agreement is being accounted for as a best efforts research and development cost sharing arrangement 
as such  the amounts funded by nasa are recognized proportionally as an offset to our cots project research and development expenses  including associated general and administrative expenses 
through december  and  million and million  respectively  of costs  including associated general and administrative expenses  were incurred on the cots program  million and million  respectively  of which were proportionally offset by nasa funding  resulting in net research and development expenses of million and million  respectively 
we believe that we will continue to incur significant research and development expenses on the taurus ii and cots development programs in and we believe that the majority of our research and development expenses are recoverable and billable under our contracts with the us government 
charging practices relating to research and development and other costs that may be charged directly or indirectly to government contracts are subject to audit by us government agencies to determine if such costs are reasonable and allowable under government contracting regulations and accounting practices 
we are currently engaged in discussions with the defense contract audit agency regarding the allowability of research and development costs incurred in connection with our taurus ii development program 
we believe that such costs are allowable  although the us government has not yet made a determination 
during  and  we incurred million  million  and million  respectively  of expenses that have been recorded as allowable costs 
if such costs were determined to be unallowable  we could be required to record revenue and profit reductions in future periods 
in  for competitive reasons  we established a self imposed ceiling on the amount of research and development costs that we would recover under our us government contracts 
although we believe that such costs would otherwise be allowable and recoverable  in and  we incurred million and million  respectively  of research and development costs in excess of our self imposed ceiling 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  and percent of revenues  in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as bid  proposal and marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase in nasa funding recognized as an offset to general and administrative expenses that are allocated to the cots research and development program discussed above  partially offset by legal fees in in connection with bid protest activities and higher bid  proposal and marketing expenses primarily relating to certain target launch vehicle procurements 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in as compared to due to a million decrease in general and administrative expenses partially offset by a million increase in bid  proposal and marketing expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a reduction in professional fees related to a us government investigation that was concluded in and a reduction in expenses associated with a deferred compensation plan 
the increase in bid  proposal and marketing expenses was primarily associated with contract proposal activity in pursuit of new contracts within the advanced space programs segment and the satellites and space systems segment 
operating income operating income was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to due to lower operating income in all three of our business segments 
satellites and space systems segment operating income declined million  or  primarily due to decreased activity on communications satellite contracts as a result of the substantial completion of certain satellites and our receipt of a million incentive on a completed technology satellite contract in launch vehicles segment operating income declined million  or  primarily due to a million increase in unrecovered taurus ii launch vehicle research and development expenses  discussed above 
advanced space programs segment operating income decreased million  or  despite segment revenue growth primarily due to a reduction in orion program activity and cost increases on certain national security satellite programs in operating income was million in  an increase of million  or  compared to primarily due to higher operating income in our advanced space programs and satellites and space systems segments  partially offset by lower operating income in our launch vehicles segment 
advanced space programs segment operating income increased million  or  due to increased activity on the orion contract and national security satellite contracts

investment impairment charge as discussed in more detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million in and million in to record the reduction in value of our investments in certain auction rate and preferred stock securities 
interest income and other interest income and other was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  and  we earned interest income of million  million and million  respectively  on short term invested cash balances 
the decreases in interest income were attributable to lower interest rates on our short term cash investments 
interest income and other in included the recognition of million of insurance proceeds in connection with a taurus launch failure in february and a million gain on the sale of an investment 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million in and million in both and these amounts are principally attributable to our long term convertible debt 
income tax provision our provision for income taxes relating to income from continuing operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for  and was  and  respectively 
the decreases in the effective tax rates in and were principally due to annual increases in research and development tax credits 
the effective tax rate in also reflects the reversal of a million reserve related to the settlement of an irs audit 
our cash income tax payments  which primarily relate to alternative minimum taxes  were approximately  and of pretax income in  and  respectively  primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that substantially offset taxable income
