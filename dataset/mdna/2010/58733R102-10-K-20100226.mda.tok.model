while we have entered in the past into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure  these are expensive  and in addition it is very difficult to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure 
inflation and certain government measures to curb inflation may have adverse effects on the economies of the countries where we operate  our business and our operations 
most latin american countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation 
inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of latin american countries 
governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation  coupled with speculation about possible future actions  have contributed to economic uncertainty over the years in most latin american countries 
the latin american countries where we operate may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy  including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation  particularly in venezuela which has recently became highly inflationary  we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures 
a return to a high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
developments in other markets may affect the latin american countries where we operate  our financial condition and results of operations 
the market value of securities of companies such as ourselves  may be  to varying degrees  affected by economic and market conditions in other global markets 
although economic conditions vary from country to country  investors perception of the events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and securities from issuers in other countries  including latin american countries 
various latin american economies have been adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred in several emerging economies in recent times  including mexico in  the collapse of several asian economies between and  the economic crisis in russia in  the brazilian devaluations in january of and in  the argentine crisis of and the market decline after september  furthermore  latin american economies may be affected by events in developed economies which are trading partners or that impact the global economy 

table of contents developments of a similar magnitude to the international markets in the future can be expected to adversely affect the economies of latin american countries and therefore us 
e commerce transactions in latin america may be impeded by the lack of secure payment methods 
unlike in the united states  consumers and merchants in latin america can be held fully liable for credit card and other losses due to third party fraud 
as secure methods of payment for e commerce transactions have not been widely adopted in latin america  both consumers and merchants generally have a relatively low confidence level in the integrity of e commerce transactions 
in addition  many banks and other financial institutions have generally been reluctant to give merchants the right to process online transactions due to these concerns about credit card fraud 
unless consumer fraud laws in latin american countries are modified to protect e commerce merchants and consumers  and until secure  integrated online payment processing methods are fully implemented across the region  our ability to generate revenues from e commerce may be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our company 
risks related to our shares the price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate substantially  and our stockholders investment may decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors  many of which are beyond our control  including those described above under risks related to our business 
further  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for internet related and technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
we cannot assure you that trading prices and valuations will be sustained 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate  such as recession or currency exchange rate fluctuations  may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  that company is often subject to securities class action litigation 
this kind of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we continue to be significantly influenced by a group of stockholders that control a significant percentage of our common shares and the value of our common stock could be negatively effected by any significant disposition of our shares by any of these stockholders 
several stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock 
as of december   ebay owned approximately million shares of our common stock which represents of our outstanding common stock as of december  
certain members of our management also hold a significant percentage of our common stock 
investment entities affiliated with general atlantic llc  collectively  general atlantic  and investment entities affiliated with tiger global  lp  collectively  tiger  beneficially own approximately million and million shares of our common stock  respectively as of december  which represent and  respectively of our outstanding common stock as of december  
these stockholders retain the power to influence the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
the interests of these stockholders may conflict with  or differ from  the interests of other holders of our common shares 
for example  these stockholders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or outstanding shares of common stock  sell revenue generating assets or inhibit change of control transactions that benefit other stockholders 
they may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business  and as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
so long as these stockholders continue to own a substantial number of shares of our common stock  they will significantly influence all our corporate decisions and together with other stockholders may be able to effect or inhibit changes in control of our company 
additionally  the actual sale  communication of an intention to sell or perceptions that any of the above mentioned stockholders may sell any significant amount of our common stock could negatively impact the market value of our common stock 

table of contents provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us  prevent a change of control  and may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our management 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit a change of control that our board of directors does not approve or changes in the composition of our board of directors  which could result in the entrenchment of current management 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations  a staggered board of directors  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors other than for cause  limitations on the ability of stockholders to own and or exercise voting power over of our common stock  limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal our by laws  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent  the authority of the board of directors to adopt a stockholder rights plan  the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with any terms that the board of directors determines and additional shares of our common stock  and limitations on the ability of certain stockholders to enter into certain business combinations with us  as provided under section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
see description of capital stock for more information 
we may require additional capital in the future  and this additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion organically or through strategic acquisitions  to develop new or enhanced services or products  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution and the securities that we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
these inabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
certain stockholders or entities controlled by them or their permitted transferees will  be able to sell their shares in the public market from time to time without registering them  subject to certain limitations on the timing  amount and method of those sales imposed by regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  or the sec 
holders of restricted stock will also have the right to cause us to register the resale of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them 
each of general atlantic and tiger agreed that  in respect of the shares each purchased in our initial public offering  neither of them would  without our prior written consent  transfer or dispose of directly or indirectly  any of its shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for our shares  for a period of months following the closing of our initial public offering that closed in august these agreements expired on january  and  accordingly  there are no further contractual restrictions precluding general atlantic and tiger from selling the shares purchased in our initial public offering 
if any of these stockholders  the affiliated entities controlled by them or their respective permitted transferees were to sell a large number of their shares  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
in addition  the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may issue securities in connection with investments and acquisitions 
the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

table of contents it is unlikely that we will declare any dividends on our capital stock 
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead  we intend to retain earnings  if any  for future operations and expansion and debt repayments 
in addition  the terms of certain of our credit agreements prohibit the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock 
any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on  among other things  our results of operations  cash requirements  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
requirements associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention 
in connection with our initial public offering  we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  and the other rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq global market 
we are also subject to various other regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sarbanes oxley act 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting  we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated 
as a result  our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm the trading price of our stock 
in addition  in connection with our initial public offering in august  we became subject to the rules of the nasdaq global market 
our compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly 
it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us in us courts 
although we are a delaware corporation  our subsidiaries and most of our assets are located outside of the united states 
furthermore  most of our directors and officers and some experts named in this report reside outside the united states 
as a result  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us or our directors or officers in us courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws 
it is unclear if original actions of civil liabilities based solely upon us federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the united states 
it is equally unclear if judgments entered by us courts based on the civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the united states 
any enforcement action in a court outside the united states will be subject to compliance with procedural requirements under applicable local law  including the condition that the judgment does not violate the public policy of the applicable jurisdiction

the mercadopago online payments solution to complement the mercadolibre marketplace  we developed mercadopago  an integrated online payments solution 
mercadopago is designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the mercadolibre marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely  easily and promptly send and receive payments online 
we operate in six reporting segments  five of which related to our marketplace business and the remainder which relates to our payment business 
within our marketplace business  we separately report our operations in each of brazil  argentina  mexico  venezuela and other countries chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  panama  peru and uruguay 
the operations of our payments business  which is available in each of brazil  argentina  mexico and chile  colombia  and venezuela  are reported in one segment 
during  our gross merchandise volume reached  million and visitors to our web site were able to browse an average of over million listings on any given day  organized by country  in over  different product categories 
we believe that we have achieved a critical mass of active buyers  sellers and product listings in most of the countries where we operate and that our business can be readily scaled to handle increases in our user base and transaction volume 
at december   we had million confirmed registered mercadolibre users 
for  we had million unique sellers  million unique buyers and million successful items sold 
for  our net revenues were million 
of those million in revenues approximately were attributable to mercadolibre marketplace listing  optional feature  up front  final value and advertisement fees 
the remaining of revenues were attributable to mercadopago fees 
although we discuss long term trends in our business  it is our policy to not provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense 
we believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near term results difficult 
further  we seek to make decisions focused primarily on the long term welfare of our company and believe focusing on short term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders 
we believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for long term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value 
we  therefore  encourage potential investors to consider this strategy before making an investment in our common stock 
a long term focus may make it more difficult for industry analysts and the market to evaluate the value of our company  which could reduce the value of our common stock or permit competitors with short term tactics to grow stronger than us 

table of contents recent developments highly inflationary status in venezuela during may  the international practices task force discussed the highly inflationary status of the venezuelan economy 
historically  the task force has used the consumer price index cpi when considering the inflationary status of the venezuelan economy 
the cpi has existed since however  the cpi covers only the cities of caracas and maracaibo 
commencing on january   the national consumer price index ncpi was developed to cover the entire country of venezuela 
since inflation data is not available to compute a cumulative three year inflation rate for the entire country solely based on the ncpi  we use a blended rate using the ncpi and cpi to calculate venezuelan inflation rate 
the cumulative three year inflation rate as of december  was calculated using the cpi information for periods before january  and ncpi information for the periods after january  the blended cpi ncpi three year inflation index months of ncpi and months of cpi at november  exceeded 
according to us gaap  calendar year end companies should apply highly inflationary accounting as from january  therefore  we will transition our venezuelan operations to highly inflationary status as of january  and  going forward  will consider the us dollar as the functional currency for venezuela 
monetary assets amounting to  and monetary liabilities amounting to  as of december   will be exposed to exchange rate changes as from january  income and expenses will be measured in us dollars at the parallel exchange rate which is bolivares fuertes per us dollar at december  description of line items net revenues we recognize revenues in each of our reporting segments 
the mercadolibre marketplace segments include brazil  argentina  mexico  venezuela and other countries chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  panama  peru and uruguay 
the mercadopago segment includes our regional payments platform consisting of our mercadopago business 
historically  we have generated revenues from the mercadolibre marketplace segments from listing fees  optional feature fees  final value fees  and online advertising fees 
during the third quarter of  we modified our pricing structure by replacing our previous listing fees and optional feature fees for consolidated up front fees which bundle these features 
we now offer three types of up front fees for three different combinations of placement and features 
up front fees are charged at the time the listing is uploaded onto our platform and is not subject to successful sale of the items listed 
following this fee structure modification  revenues for the mercadolibre marketplace segments are now generated by up front fees  final value fees  and online advertising fees

we generate revenues from our mercadopago payments segment by charging users a commission as well as a financial charge when the user elects to pay in installments  which we recognize  in both cases  once the transaction is completed 
during the year ended december   commission and installment related financial charges averaged and  respectively  of the payment amounts made by the user through mercadopago 
we have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our platforms 
for the years ended december  and  no single customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in our mercadolibre marketplace business or our mercadopago payments business 
our mercadolibre marketplace is available in twelve countries argentina  brazil  chile  colombia  costa rica  dominican republic  ecuador  mexico  panama  peru  uruguay and venezuela  and mercadopago is available in six countries argentina  brazil  chile  colombia  mexico and venezuela 
the functional currency in each country s operations is the local currency 
see critical accounting policies and estimates foreign currency translation included in this report 
therefore  our net revenues are generated in multiple foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the average monthly exchange rate 
the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenues by country from both our mercadolibre marketplace and mercadopago businesses 
year ended december  of total consolidated net revenues brazil venezuela argentina mexico other countries our subsidiaries in brazil  argentina  venezuela and colombia are subject to certain taxes on revenues which are classified as costs of net revenues 
these taxes represented  and of net revenues for  for and  respectively 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues primarily represents bank and credit card processing charges for transactions and fees paid with credit cards and other payment methods  certain taxes on revenues  compensation for customer support personnel  isp connectivity charges  depreciation and amortization and hosting and site operation fees

sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing costs for our platforms through online and offline advertising  bad debt charges  the salaries of employees involved in these activities  public relations costs  marketing activities for our users and depreciation and amortization costs 
we carry out the vast majority of our marketing efforts on the internet 
in that context  we enter in agreements with portals  search engines  ad networks and other sites in order to attract internet users to the mercadolibre marketplace and convert them into confirmed registered users and active traders on our platform 
additionally  we invest a portion of our marketing budget on cable television advertising in order to improve our brand awareness and to complement our online efforts 
we also work intensively on attracting  developing and growing our seller community through our supply efforts 
we have dedicated professionals in most of our operations that work with sellers  through trade show participation  seminars and meetings to provide them with important tools and skills to become effective sellers on our platform 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for management and administrative staff  compensation for outside directors  long term retention plan compensation  expenses for legal  accounting and other professional services  insurance expenses  office space rental expenses  travel and business expenses  as well as depreciation and amortization costs 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the following areas of our company general management  finance  administration  accounting  legal and human resources 
compensation cost related to acquisitions as part of our acquisition of cmg  which closed in the first quarter of  we entered into a management escrow agreement to secure the obligations of the cmg shareholders that remained as managers 
we accrued those compensation expenses as operating expenses  instead of considering them part of the purchase price 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
other income expenses  net other income expenses consists of interest expense interest expense relating to the working capital requirements for our mercadopago operations are recorded as interest expense and not as cost of net revenues and other financial charges  interest income derived primarily from our investments and cash equivalents  foreign currency gains or losses  the effect of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments  and other non operating results 
income and asset tax we are subject to federal and state taxes in the united states  as well as foreign taxes in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate 
our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes and asset taxes incurred in these jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting 
therefore  our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable  if any given that in certain jurisdictions we still have net operating loss carry forwards  plus the change during the period in our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents the following table summarizes the composition of our income asset taxes for the years ending december   and year ended december  in millions current federal foreign deferred federal foreign asset tax federal foreign income asset tax expense seasonality the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the twelve quarters set forth below quarter ended march  june  september  december  net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted net revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted net revenues gross profit net income loss net income per share basic net income per share diluted weighted average shares basic diluted 
table of contents seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and retail seasonality have affected  and are likely to continue to affect  our business 
typically  the fourth quarter of the year is the strongest in every country where we operate due to the significant increase in transactions before the christmas season 
however  the result of our operations in the fourth quarter of were impacted by the global economic crisis and  for that reason  our fourth quarter revenues were lower when measured in us dollars than the third quarter revenues  as a result of local currencies depreciating versus the us dollar during the period 
in addition  the result of our operations in the fourth quarter of were impacted by the change in venezuelan translation rate as described in foreign currency translation below  for that reason  our fourth quarter revenues were lower when measured in us dollars than the third quarter revenues 
our slowest period is typically the first quarter of the year 
the months of january  february and march normally correspond to summer vacation time in argentina  brazil  chile  peru and uruguay 
additionally  the easter holiday falls in march or april  and brazil celebrates carnival for one week in february or march 
this is partially mitigated by the countries located in the northern hemisphere  such as colombia  mexico and venezuela for which the slowest months are their summer months of july  august and september 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee and board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other disclosures included in with this report 
foreign currency translation historically  all of our foreign operations have used the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  these foreign subsidiaries translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies to us dollars using year end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the year 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as part of other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in non functional currencies are recognized in earnings 
net foreign currency transacction losses are included in the consolidated statements of income under the caption foreign currency loss 
until september   our venezuelan subsidiaries assets  liabilities  income and expenses were translated at the official rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed from the official exchange rate to the parallel exchange rate to translate our venezuelan financial statements 
the following facts and circumstances have been considered in the analysis of the applicable exchange rate at the date of these financial statements  we do not have a history of having obtained dividends remittances at the official exchange rate  the industry in which we operate may not influence our ability to access to the official exchange rate  
table of contents the cadivi volume of approvals of the use of the official rate was down on a year to year basis measured in july cadivi has not only delayed approvals but also removed many items from priority lists  further delaying approvals current priorities appear to be food and medicine and causing delays in the repatriation of dividends for many companies 
consequently  starting in the fourth quarter of  we translated our venezuelan assets  liabilities  income and expense accounts using the parallel exchange rate 
our venezuelan subsidiaries assets and liabilities were translated at the closing parallel exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar and the fourth quarter venezuelan subsidiaries income and expense accounts were translated at the average parallel exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar 
accordingly  the foreign currency effect on assets  included in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at september  for million has been reversed as of december  and the corresponding effect was reflected in the currency translation adjustment cta component of other comprehensive income in equity 
as of december   the total effect in currency translation adjustment related to the venezuelan subsidiaries assets  liabilities  income and expense accounts using the parallel exchange rate amounts to  the change in the translation exchange rate generated in the fourth quarter of  result in a decrease in our net revenues and net income of million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired on this basis  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill and certain indefinite live trademarks are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
impairment of goodwill and certain trademarks are tested at the reporting unit level considering each segment of the company as a reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill and certain trademarks  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
cash flow projections used are based on financial budgets approved by management 
the growth rates applied do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the business in which the reporting unit operates 
the average discount rate used is which reflects our real weighted average cost of capital 
key drivers in the analysis include confirmed registered users crus and gross merchandise volume gmv which represents a measure of the total us dollar amount of all transactions completed through the mercadolibre marketplace  excluding motor vehicles  vessels  aircraft  real estate  and services and take rate defined as marketplace revenues as a percentage of gross merchandise volume 
in addition  the benchmark in the analysis includes a business to e commerce rate  which represents growth of e commerce as a percentage of gdp  internet penetration rates as well as trends in our market share 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill or indefinite useful life intangible assets are considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
no impairments were recognized during the reporting periods and management s assessment of each reporting unit s fair value materially exceeds its carrying value 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets and goodwill is critical since it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because i it requires management to make assumptions about gross merchandise volume growth  future interest rates  sales and costs  and ii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our net income would be material 
management s assumptions about future sales and future costs require significant judgment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and chargebacks we are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
allowances for these items represent our estimate of future losses based on our historical experience 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and chargebacks amounted to million at december   million at december  and million at december  the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts is due a change in our write off policy 
until  we write off accounts receivable with an aging of days  since we write off accounts receivable which aging is days 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to sales and marketing expenses 

table of contents the following table illustrates our bad debt charges as a percentage of net revenues for  and year ended december  in millions  except percentages net revenues bad debt charges bad debt charges as a percentage of net revenues historically  our actual losses have been consistent with our charges 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts and chargebacks is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about future collections and credit analysis 
our management s assumptions about future collections require significant judgment 
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in business legal proceedings  and in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense could be costly and could divert management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay damages or modify our business practices 
any of these results could materially harm our business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon taxable income and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws in each jurisdiction and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income

our growth in net revenues was from to and from to we believe that the growth in net revenues should continue in the future 
however  despite this positive historical trend  current weak global macro economic conditions  coupled with devaluations of certain local currencies in latin america versus the us dollar  the effect of venezuelan translation and high interest rates  could lead to declining year to year net revenues  particularly as measured in us dollars

gross profit margins our business has generated sustained high gross profit margins over time  as defined by total net revenues minus total cost of net revenues  as a percentage of net revenues

our gross profit margins were for  for and for in  variations in gross profit margins are mainly a result of a faster growth in our payments business as compared to our marketplace business 
our payments business has a lower gross profit margin than our marketplace business 
in the future  gross profit margins could decline if the cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues increases as our payments business grows faster than our marketplace business  if we cannot sustain the economies of scale that we have achieved  or if we decrease the interest fees charged

as of december   total interest expense relating to the working capital requirements for our mercadopago operations have been recorded as interest expense and not as cost of net revenues 
in the year ended december   interest expenses of million  have been reclassified for comparison purposes to current year s presentation 
the increase in interest expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in foreign currency losses from million in  to million in this decrease was primarily due to a foreign currency gain of million recorded in the fourth quarter of  which was mainly a result of a positive impact of the net assets denominated in us dollars position of our venezuelan subsidiaries 
venezuela has a dual exchange rate system that comprises an official exchange rate which was bolivares fuertes per us dollar at december   and a parallel exchange rate that was bolivares fuertes per us dollar at december  based on a change in the accounting standards to international financial reporting standard ifrs implemented by venezuela in  which establishes that the parallel exchange rate should be used to account for assets and liabilities in us dollars in the statutory local financial statements  we will be recording positive retained earnings in our two main subsidiaries in venezuela  mercadolibre venezuela sa and grupo veneclasificados ca  as of december  we anticipated that this positive result will allow us to access us dollars at the official exchange rate  after a process that includes obtaining approval from the venezuelan commission of exchange administration cadivi  to distribute dividends 
if the cadivi approves the transaction  the venezuelan subsidiaries could then sell us dollars held in the united states at the parallel exchange rate  buy bolivares fuertes  and then distribute dividends buying the us dollars at the 
table of contents official exchange rate 
therefore  based on paragraph a of fas foreign currency translation  the venezuelan subsidiaries have re measured the asset and liabilities in us dollar balances outstanding at the december  parallel exchange rate 
further  in accordance with paragraph b of fas  the venezuelan subsidiaries assets  liabilities  income and expense accounts were translated at the rate applicable for dividend remittances  which at december  is the official exchange rate 
according to the international practices task force joint meeting with sec staff of june   the existence of a parallel market does not constitute unusual circumstances potentially justifying the use of an exchange rate other than the official rate for purposes of foreign currency translation 
before the fourth quarter of  this asset position  which is mainly comprised of cash and short term investments held in us bank accounts  had been historically re measured at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar  because a the subsidiaries used the us bank account balances to pay foreign suppliers  b there was no management intention to return those funds to venezuela and c mercadolibre venezuela had no accumulated profits to make a dividend distribution for statutory purposes 
that re measurement of the net asset position contributed a positive million foreign currency gain in the fourth quarter of in our consolidated statements of income and million for the full year 
the after tax positive effect on net income of the re measurement was million in the fourth quarter  and million for the full year 
this re measurement was included as non current other assets for million in our consolidated balance sheets 
the re measurement of the liabilities amounting to million was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we could have to record foreign currency losses in the future to reverse these gains  or for other factors 
given the risks in venezuela see risk factors we may not be able to distribute dividends from our venezuelan subsidiaries at the official exchange rate as a result of changes in the political  economic or regulatory environment in venezuela  and political and economic conditions in venezuela may have an adverse impact on our operations additionally  we had foreign currency losses of million in the fourth quarter of  and of million in for the full year  in all the other countries combined 
in addition  we had no impact from the accrual of expenses related to the fair value of warrants in  versus million of that were recorded for the year ended december   and we had a million increase of interest income and other financial charges  that included accrued gains related to changes in the fair value of put options  from million in to million in income and asset tax expense year ended change from december  to in dollars in income and asset tax as a percentage of net revenues the following table summarizes the changes in our blended and effective tax rate for the years ended december  and year ended december  blended tax rate effective tax rate the increase of our blended tax rate is consequence of certain factors including the impact of a new million mexican tax called impuesto empresarial a tasa nica ietu  which affects our mexican operations  the impact of million of foreign exchange losses in venezuela that were not deductible  and by the impact of million of accrued compensation expenses because this charge reduced pre tax income  but the related tax credit had a full valuation allowance 
in addition  the blended tax rate was reduced due to a reverse of the valuation allowance related to our mexican operations for millions 
our blended tax rate in  without including the reverse of the mexican valuation allowance  would have been 
as a result of the effect of permanent differences  our effective tax rate was approximately for and for the variation in the effective tax rate for these periods reflects the taxes payable plus the change during the period in our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the effective income tax rate excludes the effects of the deferred income tax  and of the above mentioned mexican tax 

table of contents factors affecting results of operations and financial condition our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as online commerce and emerging markets like latin america 
to address these risks and uncertainties  we must  among other things  maintain and increase the number of our confirmed registered users  items listed on our service and completed transactions  maintain and enhance our brand  implement and execute our business and marketing strategy successfully  continue to develop and upgrade our technology and information processing systems  continue to enhance the mercadolibre and mercadopago services to meet the needs of a changing market  provide superior customer service  respond to competitive developments  and attract  integrate  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
accordingly  we intend to invest heavily in marketing and promotion  site development  technology and operating infrastructure development and personnel 
we cannot  however  assure you that we will be successful in accomplishing all of these goals  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we have experienced significant revenue growth and significant growth in the number of our confirmed registered users and items listed by our users in recent periods  such growth rates are not sustainable and will decrease in the future 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our operating results have varied on an annual basis during our short operating history and may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
the following list includes factors that may affect our operating results continued growth of online commerce and internet usage in latin america  our ability to expand our operations and adapt to rapidly changing technologies  governmental regulation in the countries where we operate  including exchange controls  litigation  legal liability and intellectual property rights enforcement  system interruptions or failures  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  the announcement or introduction of new sites  services and products by us or our competitors  and price competition  reliance on third party service providers  increasing consumer confidence in and acceptance of the internet and other online services for commerce and  in particular  the trading of products such as those listed on our web site  security breaches and consumer confidence in the security of transactions over the internet  consumer trends and popularity of certain categories of items  our ability to attract new customers  retain existing customers and increase revenues  seasonal fluctuations  and political  social and economic conditions in latin america  particularly venezuela  including foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
also see item a risk factors for a discussion of factors that could adversely affect our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our main cash requirement historically has been working capital to fund mercadopago financing operation in brazil 
we also require cash for capital expenditures relating to technology infrastructure  software applications and office space 
in addition  we require cash to repay the promissory notes related to deremate operations acquisition 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through contributions received from our stockholders during the first two years of operations  from funds raised during our initial public offering  and from cash generated from our operations 
we have funded mercadopago by discounting credit card receivables  with loans backed with credit card receivables  selling credit cards coupons and through cash advances derived from our mercadolibre marketplace business 

table of contents at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million of long term investments mainly time deposits provided by cash generated from operations as well as the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses  funds receivable from and payable to mercadopago users  and short term debt 
as long as we continue managing our payments business by transferring credit card receivables to financial institutions in return for cash  as we have done since the last quarter of  we expect that our mercadopago business will generate cash 
the cost of discounting these receivables is built in the financing fees of mercadopago 
in the event we change the way we manage our payments business  the working capital needs related to this business could be funded  as we did in the past  through a combination of the sale of credit card coupons to financial institutions  loans backed by credit card receivables and cash advances from our marketplace business

see note out of period adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for more detail 
net cash provided by operating activities year ended change from december  to in dollars in in millions  except percentages net cash provided by operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was mainly attributable to a million decreases in working capital in our payments segment  derived mostly from the sale of credit cards receivables to financial institutions and increases of funds payable to customers due to a higher amount of transactions in net cash provided by operating activities in included approximately million mostly related to the one off effect of discounting previous quarters mercadopago credit cards receivables in october

the annual cash flow provided by operating activities was lower than net income for the year  because we began to finance payments funds payable with loans backed with payments credit card receivables  which are recorded as financial debt  and not as a reduction in the receivable balance  and therefore the cash inflow is recorded as cash flow from financing activities in the statements of cash flows  and not as cash flow from operating activities

since the fourth quarter of  we began to sell all the credit card coupons related to funds receivable from customers in our mercadopago business to financial institutions and accounted for as a sale of financial assets

during  we transferred credit card receivables to financial institutions accounted for as a sale of financial assets 
for that reason as of december  we no longer recognized the credit card portfolio as assets and no liability was recorded 
the loans backed by credit card receivables used in were recorded keeping the credit card portfolio as an account receivable and a debt for the commitments with banks 
the difference in the accounting treatment generates the decrease in net cash provided by used in financing activities 
the promissory notes issued to the seller related to the acquisition of deremate net of certain working capital adjustments for million was considered as a non cash transaction and for that reason was not included as net cash provided by financing activities 
in the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future  we may fund them with available cash  third party debt financing  or by raising equity capital  as market conditions allow 
net cash provided by financing activities for was mainly attributable to the issuance of common stock from our initial public offering debt in connection with the deremate acquisition  on september   we issued to the seller ten unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
on june   august  and december  the company paid to the sellers   and  respectively for principal and accrued interest 
the outstanding promissory notes mature on march  for a principal amount of  the promissory notes bear interest at the rate of plus for the remaining period up to their maturity and can be prepaid by us without penalty 
as of december  the balance of the promissory notes was disclosed in our balance sheet for million as principal and million as interest accrued 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  we have agreed that  for as long as the notes are outstanding  we will not incur indebtedness  on a consolidated basis  in excess of million including the debt incurred under the notes  except for intercompany debt or guarantees and guarantees provided by us or our affiliates under any discount of funds receivable from customers of mercadopago 
in  we began to finance payments funds payable in part with loans backed by payments credit card receivables  which were recorded as financial debt  and not as a reduction in the receivable balance 
as of december   we had million in loans of this type 
as a result  the cash inflow was recorded as cash flow from financing activities in the statements of cash flows  and not as cash flow from operating activities 
as discussed in net cash provided by used in financing activities section  during  we have been primarily transferring credit card receivables to financial institutions  accounted for as a sale of financial assets and for that reason no liability has been recorded as of december  and in  we financed the acquisition of deremate with a loan from ebay  one of our stockholders  in the amount of million  secured by our assets  including equity interests we have acquired in deremate 
the loan bore an interest rate of per year  payable in november of each year 
the loan matured on the issuance of securities upon the closing of our initial public offering 
at december   no principal or interest on the loan remained outstanding as we repaid the loan in full with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering in august capital expenditures our capital expenditures decreased million  to million in as compared to million in the company maintained the same level of investment on hardware and software licenses necessary to maintain and update the technology of our platform  cost of computer software developed internally  office equipment and new office space

in  our argentine subsidiary invested in a real estate trust 
the investment in this trust represents a beneficial ownership interest in  square meters divided in five floors of an office building and parking spots under construction in the city of buenos aires  argentina  where we expect to relocate our office headquarters upon completion of the building 
as of december   the argentine subsidiary has paid million into the trust 
for us gaap purposes the investment was recorded as a long term investment instead of as property and equipment 
as this investment represents an undivided interest for more than of the total amount of the real estate trust  it is accounted for under the equity method and it is classified as long term investments in our balance sheet 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  including the net proceeds from our initial public offering  sale of credit card receivables and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  property and equipment expenditures and to repay the promissory notes related to the deremate operations acquisition and other obligations going forward 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities for the purpose of facilitating contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing materially from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amount of payments 
below is a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the table 
contractual obligations at december  are as follows payment due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total includes leases of office space 
on june   our argentine subsidiary agreed to participate in a real estate trust  which investment represents a beneficial ownership interest in  square meters divided in five floors of an office building and parking spots under construction in the city of buenos aires  argentina 
we expect to relocate our office headquarters to this newly acquired office space upon completion of the building  which we expect to occur in the third quarter of as of december   the argentine subsidiary has invested million in the aforementioned trust and is expected to invest an additional million in the following months 
due to the impact of inflation and or currency fluctuations  future payments could differ from our estimates 
certain of our officers and former officers also entered into an investment in a portion of the trust  which investment represents a beneficial ownership interest in a separate floor of the same building 
we do not intend to occupy the space to be owned by this group 
in connection with the deremate acquisition  the company issued to the sellers unsecured promissory notes 
as of december   the outstanding principal amount of the debt was million 
the outstanding promissory notes mature on march  the promissory notes were issued on september  and bear interest at the rate of plus for the remaining period up to their maturity and can be prepaid by us without penalty 
we have leases for office space in certain countries in which we operate 
these are our only operating leases 
purchase obligation amounts include an obligation in the real estate trust for our new argentina office space  minimum purchase commitments for advertising  capital expenditures technological equipment and software licenses and other goods and services that were entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we have developed estimates to project payment obligations based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations 
these market risks arise mainly from the possibility that changes in interest rates and the us dollar exchange rate with local currencies  particularly the brazilian reais due to brazil s share of our revenues  may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities 

table of contents foreign currencies risk at december   the seller financing related to the acquisition of deremate consisting of unsecured promissory notes for an aggregate principal amount of million was denominated in us dollars 
we also hold cash and cash equivalents in local currencies in our subsidiaries  and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations 
our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in local currency 
as a result  our subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
at december   the total cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies totaled million  and accounts receivable and funds receivable from customers in foreign currencies totaled million 
to manage exchange rate risk  our treasury policy is to transfer most cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into dollar denominated accounts in the united states 
at december   our dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million and our dollar denominated long term investments totaled million 
for the year ended december   we incurred foreign currency losses in the amount of million as the cash and investment balances of the subsidiaries held in us dollars depreciated in local current terms 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income expenses for more detail 
our venezuelan subsidiaries re measure their foreign currency cash and cash equivalents and investments at the parallel exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our venezuelan translation exchange rate from the official exchange rate to the parallel exchange rate 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates foreign currency translation 
consequently  starting in the fourth quarter of  we translated our financial statements using the parallel exchange rate 
our venezuelan subsidiaries assets and liabilities were translated at the closing parallel exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar 
accordingly  the foreign currency effect on assets included in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at september  for  has been reversed as of december   and the corresponding effect was reflected in the currency translation adjustment cta component of other comprehensive income in equity 
for the year ended december   venezuelan subsidiaries dollar denominated expense accounts were re measured until september  at an average parallel exchange rate of bolivares fuertes per us dollar  then translated at the official exchange rate bolivares fuertes per us dollar and since october  were translated at the parallel exchange rate the average parallel exchange rate for the fourth quarter was bolivares fuertes per us dollar 
in  the dollar denominated expenses of our venezuelan subsidiaries were measured at bolivares fuertes per us dollar and the difference between the parallel exchange rate and the official exchange rate was reflected on the foreign currency line whenever cash in venezuela was transferred to the us during may  the international practices task force discussed the highly inflationary status of the venezuelan economy 
historically  the task force has used the consumer price index cpi when considering the inflationary status of the venezuelan economy 
the cpi has existed since however  the cpi covers only the cities of caracas and maracaibo 
commencing on january   the national consumer price index ncpi has been developed to cover the entire country of venezuela 
since inflation data is not available to compute a cumulative three year inflation rate for the entire country solely based on the ncpi  the company uses a blended rate using the ncpi and cpi to calculate venezuelan inflation rate 
the cumulative three year inflation rate as of december  was calculated using the cpi information for periods before january  and ncpi information for the periods after january  the blended cpi ncpi three year inflation index months of ncpi and months of cpi at november  exceeded 
according to us gaap  calendar year end companies should apply highly inflationary accounting as from january  therefore  the company will transition its venezuelan operations to highly inflationary status as of january  considering the us dollar as the functional currency 
in addition  if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses  and net income while the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars will have a negative impact in our statement of income 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  while the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars will have a positive impact in our statement of income 
during the year ended december   of our revenues were denominated in brazilian reais  in venezuelan bolivares fuertes  in argentine pesos  in mexican pesos and in the currency of other countries 
the following table summarizes the distribution of net revenues based on geography year ended december  in millions brazil argentina mexico venezuela other countries total 
table of contents the table below shows the impact on the company s net revenues  expenses  other income and income tax  net income and shareholders equity for a positive or negative fluctuation on all the foreign currencies to which we are exposed as of december  and for the year ended december  in millions actual net revenues expenses income from operations other income expenses and income tax related to p l items foreign currency impact related to the remeasument of our net asset position net income total shareholders equity apreciation of the subsidiaries local currency against us dollar depreciation of the subsidiaries local currency agains us dollar the table above shows a decrease in our net income when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies because the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars has a greater impact than the increase in net revenues  operating expenses  and other income expenses and income tax lines related to the translation effect 
similarly  the table above shows an increase in our net income when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because the re measurement of our net asset position in us dollars has a greater impact than the decrease in net revenues  operating expenses  and other income expenses and income tax lines related to the translation effect 
in the past we have entered into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure but during we did not enter into any such agreement 
interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates 
these changes can have an impact on our interest expenses derived from selling our mercadopago receivables 
at december   mercadopago funds receivable from customers totaled approximately million 
interest fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits  money market funds  investment grade corporate debt securities  and sovereign debt securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
the seller financing related to the acquisition of deremate consisting of an unsecured promissory note for an aggregate principal amount of million mature on march  the promissory note was issued on september  and bears interest at plus for the remaining period up to its maturity and can be prepaid by the company without penalty 
fixed rate liabilities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a decrease in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
due to the short term nature of the main part of our investments and because all our long term investments do not exceed a two year period  a basis point movement in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the total fair market value of our portfolio as of december  or interest expenses derived from discounting our mercadopago receivables or our promissory note issued in connection with the deremate acquisition 

table of contents our short term investments  which are classified on our balance sheet as current assets in the amount of million  can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
the book value of held to maturity securities approximates their respective fair values and consequently there are no significant unrecognized gains or losses 
equity price risk in  our board of directors approved the ltrp that will be payable as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates stock based compensation 
the variable payment ltrp liability subjects us to equity price risk
