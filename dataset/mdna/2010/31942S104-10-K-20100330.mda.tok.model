table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally accepted accounting principles 
significant accounting policies  including the impact of recent accounting pronouncements  are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are described below 
allowances for loan losses 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is described below in allowance for loan losses 
this accounting estimate is highly subjective and requires a significant amount of judgment because a multitude of factors can influence the ultimate collection of a loan 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses attempts to identify the amount of probable losses in the loan portfolio 
however  there can be no assurance that the methodology will successfully identify all probable losses as the factors and conditions that influence the estimate are subject to significant change and management s judgments 
as a result  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
other than temporary impairment of securities 
the company reviews all investment securities with significant declines in fair value for potential other than temporary impairment otti on a periodic basis 
in evaluating the investment portfolio for otti  management considers the issuer s credit rating  credit outlook  payment status and financial condition  the length of time the investment has been in a loss position  the size of the loss position and other meaningful information 
generally changes in market interest rates that result in a decline in value of an investment security are considered to be temporary  since the value of such investment can recover in the foreseeable future as market interest rates return to their original levels 
however  such declines in value that are due to the underlying credit quality of the issuer or other adverse conditions that cannot be expected to improve in the foreseeable future  may be considered to be other than temporary 
the company recognizes credit related otti on debt securities in earnings  while noncredit related otti on debt securities not expected to be sold is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
management believes this is a critical accounting policy because this evaluation of the underlying credit or analysis of other conditions contributing to the decline in value involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
as of december   the company has not recognized any otti charges 
valuation methodologies 
in the ordinary course of business  management applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities that often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being valued 
generally  in evaluating various assets for potential impairment  management compares the fair value to the carrying value 
quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets  such as investment securities 
however  for those items for which market based prices do not exist  management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items 
examples of these items include goodwill and other intangible assets  estimated present value of impaired loans  value ascribed to stock based compensation and certain other financial investments 
the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could have material positive or negative effects on the company s results of operations

table of contents comparison of financial condition at december  and total assets decreased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to decreases in net loans and cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by an increase in securities available for sale 
net loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  the primary factor of the net loan decrease was a reduction of million in residential mortgage loans as the bank continued to expand its mortgage banking activities and retained fewer residential mortgage loans in the loan portfolio 
the bank originated million in new residential mortgages for sale in the secondary market during compared to million in these loans were originated and funded by the bank and sold in the secondary market 
of this total  million paid off existing loans in the bank s portfolio 
originating mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market allows the bank to better manage its interest rate risk  while offering a full line of mortgage products to prospective customers 
commercial real estate loans decreased by million during while residential construction loans and consumer loans increased million and million  respectively  during the period 
securities available for sale  at fair value  consisting primarily of us agency and private mortgage backed obligations  us agency notes and bonds  and municipal obligations increased million  from million at december  to million at december  purchases of securities available for sale totaled million in these purchases were offset by maturities of million and principal repayments of million 
the bank invests excess cash in securities that provide safety  liquidity and yield 
accordingly  we purchase mortgage backed securities to provide cash flow for loan demand and deposit changes  we purchase federal agency notes for short term yield and low risk  and municipals are purchased to improve our tax equivalent yield focusing on longer term profitability 
the investment in securities held to maturity  consisting of federal agency mortgage backed securities and municipal obligations  decreased from  at december  to  at december  during  the bank had maturities of  and principal repayments of  cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  the bank used excess liquidity from loan repayments and increases in deposits to reduce higher cost borrowed funds  including million in federal home loan bank advances prepaid in december mentioned previously in the discussion of operating results 
total deposits increased  from million at december  to million at december  interest bearing demand deposits  money market and savings accounts increased a total of million during while time deposits decreased million during the period 
part of the increase in interest bearing demand deposits resulted from the bank s successful efforts to attract operating accounts of public entities  such as counties  cities and school corporations 
time deposits have decreased as some customers are unwilling to lock into long term commitments while interest rates are at their current low levels 
noninterest bearing demand deposits increased to million at december  federal home loan bank borrowings decreased million from million at december  to million at december  there were no new advances drawn during the year 
principal payments on advances totaled million during retail repurchase agreements  which represent overnight borrowings from business and local municipality deposit customers  increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the normal fluctuations of those accounts 
total stockholders equity attributable to the company decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease is primarily the result of net income of  offset by dividends paid of million and repurchases of treasury stock of  during the company repurchased  shares of its stock at a weighted average price of per share 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares of the  authorized by the board of directors under the current stock repurchase program which was announced in august and  shares since the original repurchase program began in 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk including commitments to extend credit under existing lines of credit and commitments to originate loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit and interest rate risk are summarized as follows at december  in thousands commitments to originate new loans undisbursed portion of construction loans unfunded commitments to extend credit under existing commercial and personal lines of credit standby letters of credit the company does not have any special purpose entities  derivative financial instruments or other forms of off balance sheet financing arrangements 
commitments to originate new loans or to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
most equity line commitments are for a term of to years and commercial lines of credit are generally renewable on an annual basis 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amounts of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  are based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes information regarding the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands deposits federal home loan bank advances retail repurchase agreements operating lease obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability of a financial institution to generate sufficient cash flow to fund current loan demand  meet deposit withdrawals and pay operating expenses 
the bank s primary sources of funds are new deposits  proceeds from loan repayments and prepayments and proceeds from the maturity of securities 
the bank may also borrow from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
while loan repayments and maturities of securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  general economic conditions and competition 
at december   the bank had cash and interest bearing deposits with banks of million and securities available for sale with a fair value of million 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of indianapolis and collateral eligible for repurchase agreements 
the bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
at december   the bank had total commitments to extend credit of million 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the bank had certificates of deposit scheduled to mature within one year of million 
historically  the bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature 
the bank is required to maintain specific amounts of capital pursuant to ots regulations 
as of december  the bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements which were effective as of such date with tangible  core and risk based capital ratios of  and  respectively 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  the company requires funds to pay any dividends to its shareholders and to repurchase any shares of its common stock 
the company s primary source of income is dividends received from the bank 
the amount of dividends the bank may declare and pay to the company in any calendar year  without the receipt of prior approval from the office of the thrift supervision ots but with prior notice to the ots  cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income as defined for the preceding two calendar years 
at december   the company had liquid assets of  effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of the financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the financial institutions performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the bank has developed strategies to manage its liquidity  shorten its effective maturities of certain interest earning assets and decrease the interest rate sensitivity of its asset base 
management has sought to decrease the average maturity of its assets by emphasizing the origination of short term commercial and consumer loans  all of which are retained by the bank for its portfolio 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits  compared to brokered deposits  reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 

table of contents quantitative aspects of market risk 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does the bank engage in hedging activities or purchase high risk derivative instruments 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
the bank uses interest rate sensitivity analysis to measure its interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained basis point decrease to a basis point increase in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
using data compiled by the ots  the bank receives a report that measures interest rate risk by modeling the change in npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
this procedure for measuring interest rate risk was developed by the ots to replace the gap analysis the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a specific time period 
the following tables are provided by the ots and set forth the change in the bank s npv at december   based on ots assumptions that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates  with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counteract that change 
at december  net portfolio value net portfolio value as a percent of present value of assets change in rates dollar amount dollar change percent change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp bp  bp the preceding tables indicate that the bank s npv would be expected to decrease in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates and would be expected to increase in the event of a sudden and sustained decrease in prevailing market interest rates 
the expected decrease in the bank s npv given an increase in rates is primarily attributable to the relatively high percentage of fixed rate loans and debt securities in the bank s portfolio 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate loans and substantially all of the debt securities portfolio consists of fixed rate securities 
certain assumptions utilized by the ots in assessing the interest rate risk of savings associations within its region were utilized in preparing the preceding tables 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayments  deposit decay rates  and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates of deposit could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables
