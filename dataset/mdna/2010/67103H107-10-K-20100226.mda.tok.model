overview o reilly automotive  inc is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts  tools  supplies  equipment and accessories in the united states 
we are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers  selling our products to both do it yourself diy customers and professional installers 
our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials  automotive tools and professional installer service equipment 
as of december   we operated  stores in states 
operating within the retail industry  we  along with other retail companies  are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including  but not limited to  fuel costs  unemployment rates  consumer preferences and spending habits and competition 
the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our company and the retail sector in general 
we cannot predict whether  when  or the manner in which  these economic conditions will change 
we believe that the number of us miles driven  number of us registered vehicles  average vehicle age  new light vehicle sales  unperformed maintenance and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket 
number of us miles driven and number of us registered vehicles total miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell 
the long term trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the us has exhibited steady growth over the past decade 
between and  the total number of miles driven in the united states increased at an annual rate of approximately 
according to the department of transportation  estimated total number of miles driven declined by in and increased slightly in the relatively flat number of miles driven during as compared to is due to lower fuel costs compared to those in  but the overall decrease in miles driven in recent years is a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions 
the total number of registered vehicles on the road increased from million light vehicles in to million in we believe that the decrease in miles driven in and the relatively flat number of miles driven in is a short term trend  and that long term miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road 

table of contents average vehicle age and new light vehicle sales changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products 
as the average age of a vehicle increases  the vehicle goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes  belts  hoses  batteries and filters 
the sales of these products are a key component of our business 
as reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association aaia the average age of the united states vehicle population has increased over the past decade from years for passenger cars and years for light trucks in to and years  respectively  in based on estimates provided by the aaia  new car sales decreased between and for the light vehicle market  however  sales for the same market decreased in due to difficult economic conditions and better engineered vehicles  we expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue 
unperformed maintenance according to estimates compiled by the aaia  the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the united states totaled billion for this metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed 
consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand 
we believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in contributed to the amount of unperformed maintenance  however  with the reduced number of new car sales  we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance is decreasing as people place a higher focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment 
product quality differentiation we provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer 
for many of our product offerings  this quality differentiation reflects good  better  and best alternatives 
our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products 
consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry 
we believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade down to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic conditions 
we have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future 
key events and recent developments several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below on july   we completed the acquisition of csk auto corporation csk  one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest such retailers in the united states  based on store count 
pursuant to the merger agreement  each share of csk common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive of a share of o reilly common stock and in cash 
the results of csk s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
on july   to fund the csk acquisition  we entered into a credit agreement for a billion asset based revolving credit facility abl credit facility arranged by bank of america  na ba  which we used to refinance debt  fund the cash portion of the acquisition  pay for other transaction related expenses and provide liquidity for our combined company going forward 
on july   we agreed to become a guarantor  on a subordinated basis  of the million principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due the notes originally issued by csk 
the notes are exchangeable  under certain circumstances  into cash and shares of our common stock 
the notes bear interest at per year until december   and until maturity on december  on each of july   october   november   and january   we entered into interest rate swap transactions with branch banking and trust company bbt  ba  suntrust bank suntrust and or barclays capital barclays 
we entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on libor on an aggregate of million of our debt that is outstanding under the credit agreement 
the interest rate swap transaction we entered into with suntrust on november   was for million and matured on november  since july   and as a result of the csk acquisition  we have incurred and will continue to incur legal fees related to ongoing governmental investigations and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced against csk and former csk employees 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated years ended december  sales cost of goods sold  including warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income debt prepayment costs interim facility commitment fee interest expense interest income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to sales increased billion  or  from billion in to billion in the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december  in millions increase in sales for the year ended december  compared to the same period in comparable store sales stores opened throughout  excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales sales of stores opened throughout non store sales including machinery  sales to independent part stores and team members sales in for stores that have merged or closed acquired csk store sales  excluding sales that are included in comparable store sales sales after  the one year anniversary of the acquisition total increase in sales comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery  sales to independent parts stores  sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain csk branded stores were closed for conversion 
comparable store sales for stores operating on the o reilly systems increased for the year ended december  the o reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a increase for the core o reilly and post conversion schuck s stores  a increase from the converted checker stores and a decrease in comparable stores sales from the converted murray s stores 
comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy csk system increased for the year ended december  consolidated comparable store sales increased for the year ended december  we believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability  a broader selection of products offered in most stores  a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers 
we opened new o reilly branded stores and one new schuck s store in at december   we operated  stores compared to  stores at december  due to the acquisition and integration of csk  we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to new stores in  excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of csk  however  we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future 

table of contents gross profit increased million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired csk stores in versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired csk stores in  the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost  changes in our product mix  distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products 
product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of csk 
we anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired csk stores throughout the year 
we improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution 
additionally  gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to diy customers 
prior to the acquisition of csk  our mix of sales to diy customers was approximately equal to sales to professional installer customers 
at the time of the acquisition in july of  acquired csk stores generated more than of their total sales from diy customers 
the addition of the acquired csk stores predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately diy and professional installer 
in  core o reilly stores derived approximately of our sales from our diy customers and approximately from our professional installer customers  while acquired csk stores derived approximately of sales from our diy customers and approximately from our professional installer customers 
sales to diy customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional installers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional installers 
in addition  we have added our private label product lines to the acquired csk stores inventory mix 
private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products 
improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies 
the reductions in commodity prices  without corresponding decreases in retail pricing  that we experienced in returned to more normal levels by the end of and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in additionally  in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers in our western markets  we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new distribution center team members become proficient with the o reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system 
sg a increased million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in the dollar increase in sg a expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of csk and new stores 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired csk stores  which have a higher expense structure than the core o reilly store base  and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing product line changeovers for acquired csk stores 
these increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the csk headquarters operations in phoenix  arizona to our facilities in springfield  missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales 
interest expense increased million  from million or of sales in to million or of sales in the increase in interest expense is the result of a full year of borrowings under our asset based revolving credit facility in that was used to fund the acquisition of csk in  the opening of new stores  ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of csk  the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in on the non swapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our asset based revolving credit facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes 
other income expense for the year ended december   included one time charges of million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the csk acquisition and million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility 
our provision for income taxes increased from million in effective tax rate to million in effective tax rate 
the decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the one time charge to adjust tax liabilities in relating to the csk acquisition  offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where csk stores are located 
the increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes 
as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income increased million from million in of sales to million in of sales 
our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december   increased to on million shares compared to for the year ended december   on million shares 
our year ended december   included one time and non cash charges related to the july   acquisition of csk 
these charges included one time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt  commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility  a one time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of csk  a one time charge to conform the csk team member vacation policy with the o reilly policy and a non cash charge to amortize the value assigned to csk s trade names and trademarks  which will be amortized 
table of contents over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of csk store locations 
our year ended december   results included a non cash charge to amortize the value assigned to csk s trade names and trademarks 
adjusted diluted earnings per share  excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges  increased to for the year ended december   from for the same period one year ago 
the table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the year ended december  and in thousands  except per share data net income diluted earnings per share net income and diluted eps excluding acquisition related charges acquisition related charges debt prepayment costs  net of tax commitment fee for interim financing facility  net of tax adjustments to tax liabilities charge to conform vacation policies  net of tax amortization of trade names and trademarks  net of tax net income and diluted eps the acquisition related adjustment to eps in the above paragraph and table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with gaap 
we do not  nor do we suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  gaap financial information 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisition related charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the company s ongoing core operations 
management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this non gaap information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business 
material limitations of this non gaap measure are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts and amortization of acquisition related trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years 
we compensate for such limitations by presenting  in the table above  the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
compared to sales increased billion  or  from billion in to billion in  due to the acquisition of  csk stores and the addition of net new o reilly stores opened during the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december  in millions increase in sales for the year ended december   compared to the same period in comparable store sales o reilly stores stores opened throughout  excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales sales of stores opened through non store sales including machinery  sales to independent part stores and team members acquired csk stores total increase in sales we believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability  a broader selection of products in most stores  targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers 
consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased for the year ended december  this increase in was less than the prior year s increase of and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the csk acquisition 
the external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers discretionary income resulting from inflation  declining home and investment asset values  higher gas prices in early  increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the us economy 

table of contents comparable store sales for o reilly stores  including csk stores after conversion to the o reilly brand  but excluding the acquired  yet to be converted csk stores  increased for the year ended december  comparable store sales for acquired csk stores open at least one year decreased for the portion of those stores sales since the july  acquisition by o reilly as compared to the same period in when csk s sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future 
we expect future sales growth as the csk stores are converted to the o reilly dual market strategy 
comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery  sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 
gross profit increased million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of csk  the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix  lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements 
we improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution 
additionally  gross margin percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of csk 
gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing o reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion of these sales are made to diy customers which typically have higher gross margin percentages and because of market conditions  primarily overall price levels  which are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are located 
product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lower cost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth 
improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies 
sg a increased million  or  from million of sales in to billion of sales in the dollar increase in sg a expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of csk and from additional team members and resources to support our increased store count 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the csk store base which has a higher expense structure than the core o reilly store base  a one time charge of million to align csk s vacation policy with the company s policy  million of non cash amortization of csk trade names and trademarks and partial de leverage of fixed sg a expenses on low comparable store sales increases 
interest expense increased million  from million or of sales in to million or of sales in the increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new asset based revolving credit facility that were used to fund the csk acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs 
other one time charges were incurred in of million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the csk acquisition and million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility 
our provision for income taxes increased from million in effective tax rate to million in effective tax rate 
the increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of csk and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired csk stores are located 
the increase is also attributable to a one time charge to adjust tax liabilities in the amount million relating to the acquisition 
as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income decreased million from million in of sales to million in of sales 
diluted earnings per share decreased per share in to per share on million diluted shares outstanding from per share in on million diluted shares outstanding 
the increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of csk 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended december  and  as well as our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended december   and in thousands year ended liquidity and related ratios december  december  percentage change current assets quick assets current liabilities working capital total debt total equity current ratio quick ratio debt to equity year ended liquidity december  december  december  total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents quick assets includes cash  cash equivalents and receivables 
working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities 
current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities 
quick ratio is calculated as current assets  less inventories  divided by current liabilities 
debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total shareholders equity 
liquidity and related ratios current assets increased from to  primarily driven by increased investment in inventory as part of the process to properly align the acquired csk stores with o reilly branded stores inventory levels and selection 
current liabilities increased from to  primarily attributable to the presentation of our acquired exchangeable notes as short term debt  due to the noteholders right to require our repurchase of the notes in  and an increase in accounts payable stemming from our increased inventory investment 
total working capital increased from to  principally as a result of our investment in inventory  offset by the related increase in accounts payable as discussed above 
total debt increased and total equity increased from to the increase in debt is primarily attributable to increased borrowing levels under our abl facility to support the integration and conversion of csk 
the increase in total equity is principally due to a increase in retained earnings resulting from net income in and an increase in additional paid in capital of primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in  which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities in was flat with the cash provided by operating activities in principally because an increase in net inventory investment in was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses  and a one time non cash charge of million to align  where possible  csk s vacation policy with the company s policy 
net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors 
the increases in net inventory investment in and were the result of investments made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of csk 
the average per store inventory for core o reilly stores increased to  as of december   from  as of december  nonconverted csk store s average per store inventory increased to  as of december   from  as of december  investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in increases in cash used in investing activities in both and was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to conversions of acquired csk stores to the o reilly brand and additional distribution centers 
capital expenditures were million in  million in 
table of contents  and million in the increase in cash used in investing activities in compared to  was due to the purchase of two distribution center facilities and land for an additional distribution center in our western markets to enhance the distribution infrastructure  the conversion of acquired csk stores to o reilly systems 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in compared to was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition and in the integration of csk  partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for new store construction 
we opened   and net stores in  and  respectively 
in  we plan to open new stores  convert acquired csk stores to o reilly systems  open three new distribution centers in the west  relocate and convert an existing acquired csk distribution center to o reilly systems and convert an existing acquired csk distribution center to o reilly systems 
the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition  improvements  fixtures  net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately million to million  however  such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease  rather than purchase  the store site 
capital costs associated with the conversion of csk stores include investments in store computer systems  signage  fixtures  interior and exterior renovation  and delivery vehicles 
the average estimated capital conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately  total capital expenditures in are expected to range from million to million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided by financing activities in was the result of a reduction in payments on long term debt in compared to primarily relating to the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt  debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of csk in and an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans along with the increase in the associated tax benefit from the exercises partially offset by reduced borrowings under our asset based credit facility 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in was the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our asset based credit facility  which was partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt and debt assumed in the csk acquisition  debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of csk 
sources of liquidity our current business strategy requires capital to open new stores  convert acquired csk stores  expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores 
the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our abl credit facility 
decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations 
additionally  decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our abl credit facility 
in  we plan to open new stores and open three new distribution centers in our western markets 
we also plan to relocate an existing acquired csk distribution center in northern california to a larger facility and plan to convert our acquired phoenix distribution center to o reilly systems 
in addition  we plan to convert acquired csk stores to o reilly systems in we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our abl credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short term and long term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  if our liquidity is insufficient  we may be forced to limit our planned expansion in there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 
credit facility on july   in connection with the acquisition of csk  we entered into a credit agreement for a five year billion asset based revolving credit facility abl credit facility arranged by bank of america  na  which we used to refinance debt  fund the cash portion of the acquisition  pay for other transaction related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward 
this facility replaced a previous unsecured  five year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
the abl credit facility is comprised of a billion tranche a revolving credit facility and a million first in last out revolving credit facility filo tranche 
on the date of the transaction  the amount of the borrowing base available  as described in the abl credit agreement  under the abl credit facility was billion of which we borrowed million 
we used borrowings under the abl credit facility to repay certain existing debt of csk  repay our million a senior notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility 
as of december  and  the amount of the borrowing base available under the credit facility was billion and billion  respectively  of which we had outstanding borrowings of million and million  respectively 
the available borrowings under the credit facility are also reduced by stand by letters of credit issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies 
as of december  and  we had stand by letters of credit outstanding in the amount of million and million  respectively  and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under the credit facility was million and million  respectively 
as part of the credit agreement  we have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral and we are subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant  with which we complied on december  and in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement  certain actions may be taken  these actions include  but are not limited to  the summarized items below 
table of contents termination of credit extensions  any outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest could become immediately payable  cash collateralization of all letter of credit obligations  and or litigation from lenders 
borrowings under the tranche a revolver bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either a base rate plus per annum or libor plus per annum  with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds 
borrowings under the filo tranche bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either a base rate plus per annum or libor plus per annum  with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds 
the base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by bank of america from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 
fees related to unused capacity under the abl credit facility are assessed at a rate of of the remaining available borrowings under the facility  subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity 
in addition  we paid customary commitment fees  letter of credit fees  underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility 
on july   october   november   and january   we entered into interest rate swap transactions with bbt  ba  suntrust and or barclays 
we entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on libor on an aggregate of million of our debt that is outstanding under our abl credit agreement  dated as of july  we are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts  while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount 
the interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of our debt  which exists under the credit agreement plus an applicable margin under the terms of the same credit facility 
the interest rate swap transactions have maturity dates ranging from august   through october  the interest rate swap transaction we entered into with suntrust on november   was for million and matured on november   increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount of million as of december  on january  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with barclays in the amount of million  reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount of million as of that date 
senior exchangeable notes on july   we agreed to become a guarantor  on a subordinated basis  of the million principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due the notes originally issued by csk 
the notes are exchangeable  under certain circumstances  into cash and shares of our common stock 
the notes bear interest at per year until december   and until maturity on december  prior to their stated maturity  the notes are exchangeable by the holders only under the following circumstances as more fully described in the indenture under which the notes were issued during any fiscal quarter and only during that fiscal quarter commencing after july   if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the applicable exchange price of for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days  if we have called the notes for redemption  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  such as a change in control 
upon exchange of the notes  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and  in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged  shares of our common stock in respect of that excess 
the total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each  in principal amount of the notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of shares of our common stock and in cash 
the incremental net shares for the notes exchange feature were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended december   however the incremental net shares for the notes exchange feature were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended december   as the impact would have been antidilutive 
the noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest on december   december   or december   or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture 
we may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after december   upon at least calendar days notice 
our intention is to redeem the notes in december of  and we plan to fund the redemption with available borrowings under our abl credit facility 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost effective alternative to our existing sources of cash 
we do not believe  however  that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans 
on december   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction with an unrelated party 
under the terms of the transaction  we sold properties  including land  buildings and improvements  which generated million of cash 
the lease  which is being accounted for as an operating lease  provides for an initial lease term of years and may be extended for one initial ten year period and two additional successive periods of five years each 
the resulting gain of million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term 
net rent expense during the initial term is approximately million annually 
in august  we entered into a sale leaseback with o reilly wooten llc an entity owned by certain affiliates of the company 
the transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine o reilly auto parts stores and generated approximately million of cash 
the transaction did not result in a material gain or loss 
the lease  which has been accounted for as an operating lease  calls for an initial term of years with three five year renewal options 
on september   we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our million synthetic operating lease facility with a group of financial institutions 
the terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years  a residual value guarantee of approximately million at december  and purchase options on the properties 
on july   in connection with the acquisition of csk  we purchased all the properties included in our synthetic operating lease facility for million  thus terminating the facility 
the purchase was funded through borrowings under the abl credit facility 
on july   and as a result of the acquisition  we entered into a master lease agreement with ari fleet lt ari  which was originally entered into on march   by csk 
the lease agreement with ari is for the lease of all of csk s delivery and management vehicles  which is accounted for as a capital lease 
under the master agreement  a lease contract is created on each vehicle  with terms typically ranging from to months 
interest expense on the capital lease totaled million for each of the years ended december  and at december  and  the book value of the ari master lease agreement was million and million  respectively 
we issue stand by letters of credit provided by a million sub limit under the abl credit facility that reduce our available borrowings 
these letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies 
substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one year term from the date of issuance 
letters of credit totaling million and million were outstanding at december  and  respectively 

table of contents contractual obligations deferred income taxes  self insurance accruals  interest payments on our variable rate long term debt and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities  the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms 
due to the absence of scheduled maturities  the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in  which are included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
our contractual obligations at december   included commitments for future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements  short and long term debt arrangements  interest payments related to long term debt  fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments  which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in note long term debt and note commitments to the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management 
management bases its assumptions  estimates  and adjustments on historical experience  current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates 
management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 
vendor concessions we receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  allowances for warranties  merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates 
co operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program  specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes  are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
all other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory 
amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns 
management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations 
based on our historical results and current assessment  we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations 
the eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability  property loss  and employee health care benefits 
with the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities  which are limited by the design of these plans  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability or property loss claim 
when estimating our self insurance liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience and trend lines  projected medical and legal inflation  and growth patterns and exposure forecasts 
the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations 
our calculation of self insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities 
actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates  which may result in material losses or gains 
as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods  we adjust our self insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information 
these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value 
these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities  but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns 
we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities 
if self insurance reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  accounts receivable we provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors 
actual results have consistently been within management s expectations  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  if actual results differ from our estimates  we may be exposed to losses or gains 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed from our estimated allowance at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  taxes we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit 
the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors  such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority  experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings 
changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and or changes in tax regulations 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates 
alternatively  we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position 
our judgment regarding the most likely outcome of uncertain tax positions has historically resulted in an estimate of our tax liability that is greater than actual results 
while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion  our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 
inventory obsolescence and shrink inventory  which consists of automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and tools  is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal 
the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population 
we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and  accordingly  have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand 
we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost 
this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate  at a given point in time  the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods 
ultimately  our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances 
we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 
we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink 
we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic  full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers 
to 
table of contents the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage  we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances 
we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates 
if unrecorded shrink were changed from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on december  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
we have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired  we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs  however  we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of december   nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing 
if the price of o reilly stock  which was a primary input used to determine the company s market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing  changed by from the value used during testing  the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 
closed property reserves we maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations 
we accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments  contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date  net of estimated sublease income 
the closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms 
we estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
if closed property reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  legal reserves we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which o reilly is currently involved 
we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations that are being conducted against csk and litigation commenced against its former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date 
as a result of the acquisition  we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations  litigation and indemnity obligations 
our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of csk  which was finalized on june  management  with the assistance of outside legal counsel  must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures 
if legal reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  inflation and seasonality for the last three fiscal years  we have been successful  in many cases  in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs  economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying 
to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry wide  we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products 
as a result  we do not believe our operations have been materially  adversely affected by inflation 

table of contents to some extent  our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns 
while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year  our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters of the year

in april  the fasb issued the financial instruments topic asc of the fasb asc 
this topic requires quarterly disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of all financial instruments  and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june  we adopted the provisions of asc beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended june  the application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore did not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued the subsequent events topic asc of the fasb asc 
asc incorporates into authoritative accounting literature certain guidance that already existed within generally accepted auditing standards 
asc addresses events which occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of financial statements 
under asc  as under current practice  an entity must record the effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and must disclose  but not record  the effects of subsequent events which provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date 
in addition  asc requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
asc is effective for interim and annual periods ended after june  we adopted the provisions of asc beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended june  in june  the fasb issued the generally accepted accounting standards topic asc of the fasb asc

in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu number asu  an update to the fair value measurements and disclosures topic asc 
this update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using a a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities and or b an income approach valuation technique or a market approach valuation technique  consistent with the principles of asc this update is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
we adopted this update beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended september   the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates 
primarily as a result of borrowings in to fund the acquisition of csk  we have interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december   however  from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure 
on july   october   and november   we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts the swaps with a total notional amount of million 
the interest rate swap transaction we entered into with suntrust on november   was for million and matured on november   increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates by million  to a total notional amount of million 
on january   we entered into an interest rate swap contract with barclays on an additional million of the company s outstanding floating rate debt 
the swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount 
the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
if interest rates increased or decreased by basis points  annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately million million after tax  based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our asset based credit facility  management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk
