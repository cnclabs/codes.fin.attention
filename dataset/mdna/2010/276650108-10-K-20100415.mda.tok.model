loans are placed on a nonaccrual status when any portion of the principal or interest is two scheduled payments past due or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest 
nonaccrual status loans are returned to an accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully collectible

a provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collection may not be reasonably assumed  considers among other matters  general economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  past loan loss experience  borrower economic resources  trends in loan delinquency and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risks are interest rate risk and credit risk of the mortgage investment business 
interest risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the market value of the trust s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate loans 
the company s loans are valued on the december  balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value  if impaired 
as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets are decreased  the market value of its mortgage loans may increase 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the market value of its mortgage loans may decline 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain loans 
in addition  changes in the general level of the united states prime rate can affect the company s net interest income 
the majority of the trust s liabilities are floating rate based on a spread over the daily month london inter bank offered rate libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
on account of the relatively short adjusted weighted average maturity of the mortgage investment portfolio months  a variety of financial instruments available to limit the effects of interest rate fluctuations on its operations have not been utilized 
the use of these types of derivatives such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts to hedge interest earnings assets and or interest bearing liabilities carry risks  including the risk that the net losses on a hedge position may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
as the level of variable rate mortgage financing of the portfolio increases or the weighted average maturity of the portfolio increases  the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments to limit the effects of interest rate fluctuations 
credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults and foreclosures 
default and foreclosure rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property values  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the american economy and other factors beyond the control of the trust 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default and foreclosure 
an increase in the company s default rates may reduce the book value of the company s assets  earnings and cash flow available to fund operations or pay dividends 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  limiting loans in the mortgage investment portfolio including the maximum deferral of interest  establishing loss assumptions and carefully monitoring loan performance 
nevertheless  the company assumes that a certain portion of its loan originations will default and adjusts the allowance for loan losses based on that assumption 
concentration risk 
concentration risk is the exposure to loss associated with declines in assets that are geographically homogenous 
as of the company s real estate is located in california  the company is subject to economic risks associated with their physical concentration within the state of california as well as risks associated with the state s economy 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the maturity of assets and liabilities 
in general  management s strategy is to approximately match the term of the mortgage investment portfolio s liabilities to the portfolio s adjusted weighted average maturity months 
the majority of the investment mortgage loans pay a fixed rate and the income from such assets are relatively unaffected by interest rate changes 
the associated liabilities are currently under variable rate lines of credit that reset monthly 
given this relationship between assets and liabilities  the interest rate sensitivity gap is highly negative 
this implies that a period of falling short term interest rates will tend to increase net interest income  while a period of rising short term rates will tend to reduce the net interest income
