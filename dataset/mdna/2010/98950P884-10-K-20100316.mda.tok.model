item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe that we are the first company dedicated solely to developing the full spectrum of next generation access network solutions to cost effectively deliver high bandwidth services while simultaneously preserving the investment in today s networks 
our next generation solutions are based upon our single line multi service  or slms  architecture 
from its inception  this slms architecture was specifically designed for the delivery of multiple classes of subscriber services such as voice  data and video distribution  rather than being based on a particular protocol or media 
in other words  our slms products are built to support the migration from legacy circuit to packet technologies and from copper to fiber technologies 
this flexibility and versatility allows our products to adapt to future technologies while allowing service providers to focus on the delivery of additional high bandwidth services 
because this slms architecture is designed to interoperate with existing legacy equipment  service providers can leverage their existing networks to deliver a combination of voice  data and video services today  while they migrate  either simultaneously or at a future date  from legacy equipment to next generation equipment with minimal interruption 
we believe that our slms solution provides an evolutionary path for service providers from their existing infrastructures  as well as gives newer service providers the capability to deploy cost effective  multi service networks that can support voice  data and video 
our global customer base includes regional  national and international telecommunications carriers 
to date  our products are deployed by over network service providers on six continents worldwide 
we believe that we have assembled the employee base  technological breadth and market presence to provide a simple yet comprehensive set of next generation solutions to the bandwidth bottleneck in the access network and the other problems encountered by network service providers when delivering communications services to subscribers 
since inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and had an accumulated deficit of  million as of december  going forward  our key financial objectives include the following increasing revenue while continuing to carefully control costs  continued investments in strategic research and product development activities that will provide the maximum potential return on investment  and minimizing consumption of our cash and short term investments 
global market and economic conditions over the past two years have been unprecedented and challenging  with most major economies experiencing tighter credit conditions and an economic recession 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term and widespread recession  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies 
in the second half of and during  federal government interventions in the us financial system led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
continued unfavorable economic and market conditions globally may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
sale of legacy inventory and other assets in january  we sold our gigamux legacy product line to a third party 
the sale of the gigamux legacy product line was not treated as a discontinued operation since it did not represent a component of the company that had operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguishable  operationally and for financial reporting 
table of contents purposes  from the rest of the entity 
we allocated the proceeds received to receivables  inventory  fixed assets and intangible assets based on the relative fair value of the assets sold 
we recognized a gain of million on the sale of the inventory related to this product line in the first quarter of that was recorded in cost of revenue 
we also recognized a gain of million and million on the sale of fixed assets and intangible assets  respectively  in the first quarter of that was recorded as a component of operating expenses 
we are entitled to additional contingent consideration for the sale of the gigamux legacy product line upon the buyer s usage of inventory and or attainment of certain performance targets through december additional contingent consideration  if any  will be recorded upon receipt of cash as an additional gain in cost of revenue

during  we recognized an additional gain of million that was recorded in cost of revenue 
we will continue to record additional gain in the future contingent upon attainment of certain earnout provisions 
in addition to the sale of the inventory  we also sold fixed assets related to the access node legacy product line  which resulted in a gain of million in that was recorded as a component of operating expenses 
during december  we entered into an agreement to sell inventory and certain assets related to our imarc legacy product line to a third party 
the sale of the imarc legacy product line was not treated as a discontinued operation since it did not represent a component of the company that had operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguishable  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
upon the performance of certain obligations and delivery of the assets in the first quarter of  we recognized a gain of million that was recorded in cost of revenue 
upon the sale of the remaining imarc inventory during the second quarter of  we recognized an additional gain of million that was recorded in cost of revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because changes in such estimates can materially affect the amount of our reported net income or loss 
for all of these policies  management cautions that actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment of product under contractual terms which transfer title to customers upon shipment  under normal credit terms  net of estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue is deferred if there are significant post delivery obligations  if collection is not considered reasonably assured at the time of sale  or if the fees are not fixed or determinable 
when significant post delivery obligations exist  revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
our arrangements generally do not have any significant post delivery obligations 
if our 
table of contents arrangements include customer acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized upon obtaining the signed acceptance certificate from the customer  unless we can objectively demonstrate that the delivered products or services meet all the acceptance criteria specified in the arrangement prior to obtaining the signed acceptance 
in those instances where revenue is recognized prior to obtaining the signed acceptance certificate  we use successful completion of customer testing as the basis to objectively demonstrate that the delivered products or services meet all the acceptance criteria specified in the arrangement 
we also consider our historical acceptance experience with the customer  as well as the payment terms specified in the arrangement  when revenue is recognized prior to obtaining the signed acceptance certificate 
we offer products and services such as support  education and training  hardware upgrades and post warranty support 
for multiple element revenue arrangements  we establish the fair value of these products and services based primarily on sales prices when the products and services are sold separately 
if fair value cannot be established for undelivered elements  all of the revenue under the arrangement is deferred until those elements have been delivered 
when collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when cash is collected 
revenue from education services and support services is recognized over the contract term or as the service is performed 
we make certain sales to product distributors 
these customers are given certain privileges to return a portion of inventory 
return privileges generally allow distributors to return inventory based on a percent of purchases made within a specific period of time 
we recognize revenue on sales to distributors that have contractual return rights when the products have been sold by the distributors  unless there is sufficient customer specific sales and sales returns history to support revenue recognition upon shipment 
in those instances when revenue is recognized upon shipment to distributors  we use historical rates of return from the distributors to provide for estimated product returns 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience and expected future costs 
allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts we record an allowance for sales returns for estimated future product returns related to current period product revenue 
the allowance for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and an allowance against our accounts receivable 
we base our allowance for sales returns on periodic assessments of historical trends in product return rates and current approved returned products 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our future revenue could be adversely affected 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments for amounts owed to us 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our allowance on periodic assessments of our customers liquidity and financial condition through analysis of information obtained from credit rating agencies  financial statement reviews and historical collection trends 
additional allowances may be required in the future if the liquidity or financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment in their ability to make payments 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets our long lived assets have consisted primarily of goodwill  other acquisition related intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review goodwill for impairment in november of each year  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating an acquired business  a significant change in the operations of an acquired business  or significant negative economic trends  such as stock price movements 
we utilize a two step impairment test with respect to goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we have determined that we operate in a single segment with one operating unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on a combination of the market  income and replacement cost approaches 
in the application of the impairment testing  we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair 
table of contents value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
during  we determined that indicators of impairment existed  resulting in an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
as of december   we had no remaining goodwill 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future net undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
at december   our long lived assets consisted of million of net property and equipment 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected stock price volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
we base our expected life assumption on our historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we grant to employees 
risk free interest rates reflect the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero 
if factors change  and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net loss and net loss per share 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
fair value stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  includes compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  effective january   we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated method to the straight line method 
compensation expense for all employee share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated method while compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  is recognized using the straight line method 
in addition  stock based compensation expense was recorded for options issued to non employees 
these options are generally immediately exercisable and expire seven to ten years from the date of grant 
we value non employee options using the black scholes model 
non employee options subject to vesting are valued as they become vested 
in november  we completed the exchange offer to exchange certain stock options issued to eligible employees  officers and directors of zhone under zhone s equity incentive compensation plans 
the primary 
table of contents purpose of the exchange offer was to motivate  retain and reward talented employees and directors 
stock options previously granted that had an exercise price per share of equal to or greater than per share were eligible to be exchanged on a one for one basis for new stock options with an exercise price equal to the last reported sale price of zhone common stock on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
options for an aggregate of million shares of common stock were exchanged on november  the new stock options issued pursuant to the exchange offer have an exercise price of  vest over a four year period with no credit for past vesting and have a seven year term 
the exchange offer will result in incremental stock based compensation of approximately million to be recognized over the four year vesting period 
the remaining unrecognized compensation expense of the original grant will be amortized over the original requisite service period 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
in assessing the net realizable value of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
once inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  its carrying value cannot be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
to the extent that a severe decline in forecasted demand occurs  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may incur significant charges for excess inventory 
operating lease liabilities as a result of our acquisition of paradyne in september  we assumed certain lease liabilities for facilities in largo  florida 
we have accrued a liability for the excess portion of these facilities 
the computation of the estimated liability includes a number of assumptions and subjective variables 
these variables include the level and timing of future sublease income  amount of contractual variable costs  future market rental rates  discount rate  and other estimated expenses 
if circumstances change  and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the lease liability may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
during the second quarter of  we increased the excess lease liability balance by million with a corresponding charge to general and administrative expenses 
during  we assumed that we would no longer be able to sublease the remaining excess space due to the continued deterioration in the real estate market 
accordingly  during  we increased our excess lease liability balance by million  with a corresponding charge to general and administrative expenses

for example  during the year ended december   we sold million of customer trade receivables to silicon valley bank on a non recourse basis in exchange for cash 
the sale of the receivables did not represent a securitization  and there was no continuing involvement or interests in the receivables by us after the sale 
our ability to provide customer financing is limited and depends upon a number of factors  including our capital structure  the level of our available credit and our ability to factor commitments to third parties 
any extension of financing to our customers will limit the capital that we have available for other uses 
our accounts receivable  while not considered a primary source of liquidity  represents a concentration of credit risk because a significant portion of the accounts receivable balance at any point in time typically consists of large balances due from a relatively small number of customer account balances 
as of december   etisalat accounted for of net accounts receivable  and receivables from customers in countries other than the united states represented of net accounts receivable 
we do not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures  or any other material commitments aside from operating leases for our facilities  inventory purchase commitments and debt 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations may continue 
in order to meet our liquidity needs and finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs for our business  we may need to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity financing or the sale of assets 
continued uncertainty in credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access debt financing or to refinance existing indebtedness in the future on favorable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of debt securities or other debt financing  the terms of such debt may include covenants  restrictions and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
likewise  any equity financing could result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital or are required to obtain additional capital on terms that are not favorable to us  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts beyond the reductions we have previously taken 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and available credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   our future contractual commitments by fiscal year were as follows in thousands total operating leases purchase commitments line of credit debt total operating leases the operating lease amounts shown above represent primarily off balance sheet arrangements 
for operating lease commitments  a liability is generally not recorded on our balance sheet unless the facility represents an excess facility for which an estimate of the facility exit costs has been recorded on our balance sheet  net of estimated sublease income 
for operating leases that include contractual commitments for operating expenses and maintenance  estimates of such amounts are included based on current rates 
payments made under operating 
table of contents leases will be treated as rent expense for the facilities currently being utilized 
of the total million operating lease amount  million has been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as of december  purchase commitments the purchase commitments shown above represent non cancellable inventory purchase commitments as of december  the inventory purchase commitments typically allow for cancellation of orders days in advance of the required inventory availability date as set by us at time of order 
line of credit and debt the debt and line of credit obligations have been recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet 
the debt and line of credit obligation amounts shown above represent the scheduled principal repayments  but not the associated interest payments which may vary based on changes in market interest rates 
at december  the interest rate on our outstanding debt and line of credit obligations was 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our line of credit and an additional million committed as security for various letters of credit  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles the codifications  a replacement of the existing codification standards 
the codification  which was launched on july   became the single source of authoritative non governmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  superseding various existing authoritative accounting pronouncements 
the codification eliminates the existing gaap hierarchy and establishes one level of authoritative gaap 
all other literature is considered non authoritative 
this codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the codification in the third quarter of there was no change to our consolidated financial statements due to the implementation of the codification other than changes in reference to various authoritative accounting pronouncements in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures measuring liabilities at fair value 
the update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value of such liability using one or more of the techniques prescribed by the update 
we adopted the updated standards in the third quarter of the adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  fasb issued asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated  to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence of selling price  and to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the accounting changes summarized in asu and asu are both effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
we are currently assessing the impact of these amendments to the asc on our accounting and reporting systems and processes  however  at this time we are unable to quantify the impact on our financial statements of our adoption or determine the timing and method of our adoption

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we consider all cash and highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of the following as of december  and in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents short term investment concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments consist principally of demand deposit and money market accounts  commercial paper and corporate debentures and bonds with credit ratings of aa or better 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are principally held with various domestic financial institutions with high credit standing 
allowances are maintained for potential doubtful accounts 
during the year ended december   etisalat accounted for of net revenue 
no customer accounted for or more of net revenue for the year ended december  as of december   etisalat accounted for of net accounts receivable  which were denominated in a foreign currency 
as of december   etisalat accounted for of net accounts receivable  and another customer accounted for of net accounts receivable 
as of december  and december   receivables from customers in countries other than the united states represented and  respectively  of net accounts receivable 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
under our investment policy  short term investments have a maximum maturity of one year from the date of acquisition  and the average maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed six months 
due to the relatively short maturity of the portfolio  a increase in market interest rates at december  would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by less than million 
as of december   our outstanding debt balance was million 
interest on our debt accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a variable interest rate which adjusts every six months equal to the sum of the libor rate plus per annum  provided that in no event will the variable interest rate a exceed per annum  b be less than per annum  or c be adjusted by more than at any adjustment date 
assuming the outstanding balance on our variable rate debt remains constant over a year  a increase in the interest rate would decrease pre tax income and cash flow by approximately million 

table of contents foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
substantially all of our assets are located in the united states 
we have sales operations throughout europe  asia  the middle east and latin america 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
accordingly  our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies 
during and  we did not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure 
during both and  we recorded million of foreign exchange loss in other income expense on our statements of operations 
we have performed sensitivity analyses as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of million for and this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates  which do not always move in the same direction 
actual results may differ materially
