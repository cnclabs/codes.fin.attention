critical accounting policies we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition facility management revenues are recognized as services are provided under facility management contracts with approved government appropriations based on a net rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate 
certain of our contracts have provisions upon which a portion of the revenue is based on our performance of certain targets  as defined in the specific contract 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the amounts are fixed and determinable and the time period over which the conditions have been satisfied has lapsed 
construction revenues are recognized from our contracts with certain customers to perform construction and design services project development services for various facilities 
in these instances  we act as the primary developer and subcontract with bonded national and or regional design build contractors 
these construction revenues are recognized as earned on a percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total cost for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes to cost estimates are made in the period in which we determine that such losses and changes are probable 
typically  we enter into fixed price contracts and do not perform additional work unless approved change orders are in place 
costs attributable to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred if we believe that it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
if we believe that it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price  costs related to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which they are incurred  and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the costs 
table of contents incurred 
revenue in excess of the costs attributable to unapproved change orders is not recognized until the change order is approved 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to estimated costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
as the primary contractor  we are exposed to the various risks associated with construction  including the risk of cost overruns 
accordingly  we record our construction revenue on a gross basis and include the related cost of construction activities in operating expenses 
in instances where we provide project development services and subsequent management services  we evaluate these arrangements to determine if there are multiple elements that require separate accounting treatment and could result in a deferral of revenues 
generally  our arrangements result in no delivered elements at the onset of the agreement but rather these elements are delivered over the contract period as the project development and management services are performed 
project development services are not provided separately to a customer without a management contract and therefore  the value of the project development deliverable  is determined using the residual method 
reserves for insurance losses the nature of our business exposes us to various types of third party legal claims  including  but not limited to  civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and or mistreatment  sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees  medical malpractice claims  claims relating to employment matters including  but not limited to  employment discrimination claims  union grievances and wage and hour claims  property loss claims  environmental claims  automobile liability claims  contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  personnel or prisoners  including damages arising from a prisoner s escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility 
in addition  our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation 
we maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general types of claims  except for claims relating to employment matters  for which we carry no insurance 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed 
we currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policy for all us corrections operations with limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
a separate million limit applies to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services 
our wholly owned subsidiary  geo care  is insured under their own program for general liability and medical professional liability with a specific loss limit of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
we are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits 
for most casualty insurance policies  we carry substantial deductibles or self insured retentions million per occurrence for general liability and hospital professional liability  million per occurrence for workers compensation and million per occurrence for automobile liability 
we also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including  workers compensation  environmental liability and automobile liability 
with respect to our operations in south africa  the united kingdom and australia  we utilize a combination of locally procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect the company 
our australian subsidiary is required to carry tail insurance on a general liability policy providing an extended reporting period through related to a discontinued contract 
in addition  certain of our facilities located in florida and determined by insurers to be in high risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles 
since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events  no reserves have been established to pre fund for potential windstorm damage 
limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in california may prevent us from insuring some of our facilities to full replacement value 
of the reserves discussed above  our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers compensation and general liability claims 
these reserves are undiscounted and were million and million as of january  and december   respectively 
we use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate 
table of contents amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our facilities  claim development  payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business  among other factors 
such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments 
our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards 
we also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process  including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim 
because we have high deductible insurance policies  the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience 
if actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
significant judgments are required to determine the consolidated provision for income taxes 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors such as tax regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income and the character of such taxable income 
based on our estimate of future earnings and our favorable earnings history  management currently expects full realization of the deferred tax assets net of any recorded valuation allowances 
additionally  judgment must be made as to certain tax positions which may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets or liabilities may be required  which may result in an adverse impact on the results of our operations and our effective tax rate 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 
management has not made any significant changes to the way we account for our deferred tax assets and liabilities in any year presented in the consolidated financial statements 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes increases decreases by of income before income taxes  equity in earnings of affiliate and discontinued operations  consolidated income from continuing operations would have decreased increased by million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended january   december  and december  property and equipment as of january   we had million in long lived property and equipment held for use 
property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over to years 
accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used for income tax purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of correctional and detention facilities 
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life 
we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
if a long lived asset is part of a group that includes other assets  the unit of accounting for the long lived asset is its group 
generally  we group our assets by facility for the purposes of considering whether any impairment exists 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
when considering the future cash flows of a facility  we make assumptions based on historical experience with our customers  terminal growth rates and 
table of contents weighted average cost of capital 
while these estimates do not generally have a material impact on the impairment charges associated with managed only facilities  the sensitivity increases significantly when considering the impairment on facilities that are either owned or leased by us 
events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  or when other changes occur that might impair recovery of long lived assets such as the termination of a management contract 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
impact of future accounting pronouncements the following accounting standards have implementation dates subsequent to the fiscal year ended january  and as such  have not yet been adopted by us in october  the fasb issued asu no 
which provides amendments to revenue recognition criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements 
as a result of these amendments  multiple deliverable arrangements will be separated more frequently than under existing gaap 
the amendments  among other things  establish the selling price of a deliverable  replace the term fair value with selling price and eliminate the residual method so that consideration would be allocated to the deliverables using the relative selling price method 
this amendment also significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple element arrangements 
this guidance will become effective for us prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 previously known as fas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
fin r sfas no 

asu no 
amends the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for vies 
the consolidation requirements under the revised guidance require us to consolidate a vie if the entity has all three of the following characteristics i the power  through voting rights or similar rights  to direct the activities of a legal entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  ii the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity iii the right to receive the expected residual returns of the legal entity 
further  this guidance requires that companies continually evaluate vies for consolidation  rather than assessing based upon the occurrence of triggering events 
as a result of adoption  which becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning after november   companies are required to enhance disclosures about how their involvement with a vie affects its financial statements and exposure to risks 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a 
risk factors and those included in other portions of this report 
the discussion of our results of operations below excludes the results of our discontinued operations for all periods presented

table of contents versus revenues of revenue of revenue change change dollars in thousands us corrections international services geo care facility construction and design total us corrections the increase in revenues for us corrections in compared to is primarily attributable to project activations  capacity increases and per diem rate increases at existing facilities and new management contracts 
the most significant increases to revenue were as follows i revenues increased million in total due to the activation of three new contracts in third and fourth quarter for the management of joe corley detention facility in conroe  texas  northeast new mexico detention facility in clayton  new mexico and maverick county detention facility in maverick  texas  ii revenues increased million in as a result of our opening of our rio grande detention center in laredo  texas in fourth quarter  iii revenues increased million as a result of the bed expansion of east mississippi corrections facility in meridian  mississippi  which was completed in october  iv revenues increased million at the robert a 
deyton detention facility in lovejoy  georgia as a result of the bed activation in january  v revenues increased million at the broward transition center due to an increase in per diem rates and population  vi we experienced an increase of revenues of million related to contract modifications and additional services at our south texas detention complex in pearsall  texas  vii approximately million of the increase is attributable to per diem increases  other contract modifications  award fees and population increases 
overall  we did experience slight increases over the week period ended december  related to the additional week in the week period ended january  these increases were offset by a decrease in revenues of million due to the termination of our management contract at the sanders estes unit in venus  texas  newton county correctional center in newton  texas  jefferson county downtown jail in beaumont  texas  fort worth community corrections facility in fort worth  texas  and the tri county justice detention center in ullin  illinois 
the number of compensated mandays in us corrections facilities increased by million to million mandays in from million mandays in due to the addition of new facilities and capacity increases 
we look at the average occupancy in our facilities to determine how we are managing our available beds 
the average occupancy is calculated by taking compensated mandays as a percentage of capacity 
the average occupancy in our us correction and detention facilities was of capacity in  excluding the terminated contract for tri county justice detention center which was terminated effective august the average occupancy in our us correction and detention facilities was in not taking into account the  beds activated in at four facilities in our us corrections segment 
international services revenues for our international services segment during increased over the prior year due to several reasons including i new contracts in australia and in the united kingdom for the management of the parklea correctional centre in sydney  australia and the harmondsworth immigration removal centre in london  england which contributed an incremental million and million of revenues  respectively  ii our contract in south africa for the management of kutama sinthumule correcional centre contributed an increase in revenues over the prior year of million mainly due to contractual increases linked to the south african inflationary index  and iii we also experienced an increase in revenues of million  in aggregate  
table of contents at certain facilities managed by our australian subsidiary due to contractual increases linked to the inflationary index 
these increases were offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates for the australian dollar  south african rand and british pound 
these unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates resulted in a decrease of revenues over of million 
geo care the increase in revenues for geo care in compared to is primarily attributable to the revenues from our newly acquired contract for the management of columbia regional care center in columbia  south carolina which generated million of revenues 
we also experienced combined increases of million at south florida evaluation and treatment in miami  florida and treasure coast forensic treatment center in stuart  florida as a result of increases in population 
these increases were offset by the loss of revenues from the termination of our management contract with the south florida evaluation and treatment center annex in july this contract generated million of revenues in facility construction and design the increase in revenues from the facility construction and design segment in compared to is mainly due to an increase of million related to the construction of blackwater river correctional facility  in milton  florida which commenced in first quarter this increase over the same period in the prior year was offset by decreases in construction activities at four facilities i the completion of construction for the south florida evaluation and treatment center in miami  florida in third quarter decreased revenues by million  ii the completion of construction of our northeast new mexico detention facility in clayton  new mexico in third quarter decreased revenues by million  iii the completion of florida civil commitment center in second quarter decreased revenues by million and iv the completion of graceville correctional facility in third quarter which decreased revenues by million 
operating expenses of segment of segment revenues revenues change change dollars in thousands us corrections international services geo care facility construction and design total operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our correctional  detention and mental health and geo care facilities and expenses incurred in our facility construction and design segment 
us corrections overall  operating expenses remained fairly consistent with fiscal with slight decreases as a percentage of revenues due to decreases in travel costs of million in fiscal the most significant increases to operating expense were related to new management contracts  new facility activations and increases in population from expansion beds which were activated during the fiscal year 
such projects include joe corley detention facility  northeast new mexico detention facility  maverick county detention facility  rio grande detention center  east mississippi corrections facility and robert a 
deyton detention facility 
these contracts contributed million of the increase to our operating expenses 
certain of our other facilities also experienced increases in expenses associated with increases in population and contract modifications resulting in additional services 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses as a 
table of contents result of facility closures for jefferson county downtown jail  newton county correctional center  fort worth community corrections facility  sanders estes unit and tri county justice detention center 
international services expenses increased at all of our international subsidiaries consistent with the revenue increases 
the costs associated with the new contracts in the united kingdom and australia accounted for a combined increase of million  including start up costs of million 
start up costs are non recurring costs for training  additional staffing requirements  overtime and other costs of transitioning a new management contract 
the increase in expenses in was significantly offset by the impact of foreign exchange currency rates 
overall  operating expenses for international services facilities increased slightly as a percentage of segment revenues in compared to mainly due to the start up costs in australia and the united kingdom 
geo care operating expenses for residential treatment increased million in as compared to the increase in expenses in was primarily due to our acquisition of columbia regional care center in fourth quarter 
we also experienced higher costs at florida civil commitment center due to start up costs associated with the transfer of patients into the new facility 
facility construction and design generally  the operating expenses from the facility construction and design segment are offset by a similar amount of revenues 
our overall increase in operating expenses relates to the construction of the blackwater river correctional facility which increased expenses by million

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained consistent in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the fiscal year ended december  but decreased as a percentage of revenues 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to corporate cost savings initiatives including those to reduce travel costs which were million less in and also by the increase in revenues which increased at a higher rate than general and administrative expenses 
these savings were partially offset by increases in employee benefits and labor costs 
non operating income and expense interest income and interest expense of revenue of revenue change change dollars in thousands interest income interest expense the majority of our interest income generated in and is from the cash balances at our australian subsidiary 
the decrease in the current period over the same period last year is mainly attributable to currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
the decrease in interest expense of million is primarily attributable to a decrease in libor rates which reduced the interest expense on our term loan b by million 
this decrease was offset by increased expense related to the amortization of deferred financing fees associated with the amendments to our senior credit facility 
this increase resulted in incremental amortization of million

international services revenues for our international services segment during fiscal year increased by million over fiscal year due to increases in contractual rates at some of our facilities in australia and also in south africa 
we also experienced a favorable increase in revenues of million over the prior year due to the overall strengthening of the australian dollar during fiscal year this favorable variance was offset during fiscal year by a decrease in revenues of million related to the expansion in of the campsfield house immigration removal centre which was completed in september we also experienced a decrease in revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to unfavorable foreign

geo care the increase in revenues for geo care in compared to is primarily attributable to two items i the treasure coast forensic center in stuart  florida which commenced operation in march  increased revenues by million  and ii the florida civil commitment center in arcadia  florida contributed an increase of million  both due to increases in population 
this favorable increase was partially offset by million due to the loss of the contract with the sfetc annex 
facility construction and design the decrease in revenues from construction activities is primarily attributable to the completion of construction at two facilities i the south florida evaluation and treatment center in miami  florida  which was completed in second quarter  decreased revenues by million  and ii the northeast new mexico detention facility in clayton  new mexico which was completed in third quarter and decreased revenues by million

non operating income and expense interest income and interest expense of revenue of revenue change change dollars in thousands interest income interest expense the decrease in interest income in compared to is primarily attributable to the decrease in interest rates for the period as well as the decrease in cash in as compared to in first quarter  one of the lenders elected to prepay its interest rate swap obligation to us at the call option price which approximated the fair value of the interest rate swap on the call dates 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to a significant decrease in libor rates 
we also experienced an increase in the amount of interest capitalized in connection with the construction of our correctional and detention facilities 
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life 
during fiscal years ended and  we capitalized million and million of interest expense  respectively 
this was partially offset by an increase in debt in as compared to provision for income taxes effective rate effective rate dollars in thousands income tax provision the effective tax rate during was as a result of one time state tax benefits of million

these results also include the impact of a one time tax benefit of million 
financial condition capital requirements our current cash requirements consist of amounts needed for working capital  debt service  supply purchases  investments in joint ventures  and capital expenditures related to the development of new correctional  detention and or mental health facilities 
in addition  some of our management contracts require us to make substantial initial expenditures of cash in connection with opening or renovating a facility 
generally  these initial expenditures are subsequently fully or partially recoverable as pass through costs or are billable as a component of the per diem rates or monthly fixed fees to the contracting agency over the original term of the contract 
additional capital needs may also arise in the future with respect to possible acquisitions  other corporate transactions or other corporate purposes 
we are currently developing a number of projects using company financing 
we estimate that the remaining capital expenditures related to these existing capital projects will be million to be spent in capital expenditures related to facility maintenance costs are expected to range between million and million 
in addition to these current estimated capital requirements for  we are currently in the process of bidding on  or evaluating potential bids for the design  construction and management of a number of new projects 
in the event that we win bids for these projects and decide to self finance their construction  our capital requirements in and or could materially increase 
liquidity and capital resources we plan to fund all of our capital needs  including our capital expenditures  from cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and any other financings which our management and board of directors  in their discretion  may consummate 
our primary source of liquidity to meet these requirements is cash flow from operations and borrowings from the million revolver under our senior credit facility see discussion below 
as of january   we had a total of million of consolidated debt outstanding  excluding million of non recourse debt and capital lease liability balances of million 
as of january   we also had outstanding eight letters of guarantee totaling million under separate international credit facilities 
based on our debt covenants and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding  as of february   we had the ability to borrow an additional approximately million under our revolver after considering debt covenants 
we also have the ability to borrow million under the accordion feature of our senior credit facility subject to lender demand and market conditions 
our significant debt service obligations could have material consequences 
see risk factors risks related to our high level of indebtedness 
our management believes that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility will be adequate to support our capital requirements for and disclosed above 
however  we are currently in the process of bidding on  or evaluating potential bids for  the design  construction and management of a number of new projects 
in the event that we win bids for these projects and decide to self finance their construction  our capital requirements in and or could materially increase 
in that event  our cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings under the senior credit facility may not provide sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs through and and we could be forced to seek additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that any such financing or refinancing would be available to us on terms equal to or more favorable than our current financing terms  or at all 
in the future  our access to capital and ability to compete for future capital intensive projects will also be dependent upon  among other things  our ability to meet certain financial covenants in the indenture governing 
table of contents the senior notes and in our senior credit facility 
a substantial decline in our financial performance could limit our access to capital pursuant to these covenants and have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and capital resources and  as a result  on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to these foregoing potential constraints on our capital  a number of state government agencies have been suffering from budget deficits and liquidity issues 
while the company expects to be in compliance with its debt covenants  if these constraints were to intensify  our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted as could our compliance with these debt covenants 
we have entered into individual executive retirement agreements with our two top executives 
these agreements provide each executive with a lump sum payment upon retirement 
under the agreements  the executives may retire at any time after reaching the age of both of the executives reached the eligible retirement age of in however  under the retirement agreements  retirement may be taken at any time at the individual executive s discretion 
in the event that both executives were to retire in the same year  we believe we will have funds available to pay the retirement obligations from various sources  including cash on hand  operating cash flows or borrowings under our revolver 
based on our current capitalization  we do not believe that making these payments in any one period  whether in separate installments or in the aggregate  would materially adversely impact our liquidity 
on february   we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock effective through march  the stock repurchase is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities and exchange requirements 
the program may also include repurchases from time to time from executive officers or directors of vested restricted stock and or vested stock options 
the stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any specific amount of our common stock and may be suspended or extended at any time at the our discretion 
as of february   geo had million shares outstanding 
we are also exposed to various commitments and contingencies which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
see item legal proceedings 
the senior credit facility on october   on october   and again on december   we completed certain amendments to our senior credit facility 
these amendments  among other things  modified the aggregate size of the revolver from million to million  extended the maturity of the revolver to  modified the permitted maximum total leverage and maximum senior secured leverage financial ratios  eliminated the annual capital expenditures limitation and made several technical revisions to certain definitions therein 
our senior credit facility is now comprised of a million term loan b bearing interest at libor plus and maturing in january and the million revolver which currently bears interest at libor plus and matures in september also  upon the execution these amendments we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility by another million subject to lender demand  market conditions and existing borrowings

we have designated these interest rate swaps as hedges against changes in the fair value of a designated portion of the senior notes due senior notes due to changes in underlying interest rates 
these interest rate swaps  which have payment  expiration dates and call provisions that mirror the terms of the senior notes  effectively convert million of the senior notes into variable rate obligations

cash proceeds from our senior notes were primarily used to pay down our senior notes and our revolver and to pay down our revolver 
we intend to use cash flows from operations and future borrowings under our revolver to fund the project discussed above and other projects we may announce during fiscal we believe the institutions and banks included in our lender group will be able to fund their commitment to our revolver 
however  we can provide no assurance regarding their solvency or ability to honor their commitments 
failure to honor a commitment could materially impact our ability to meet our future capital needs and complete the projects discussed above

inflation we believe that inflation  in general  did not have a material effect on our results of operations during  and while some of our contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  inflation could have a substantial adverse effect on our results of operations in the future to the extent that wages and salaries  which represent our largest expense  increase at a faster rate than the per diem or fixed rates received by us for our management services 
outlook the following discussion of our future performance contains statements that are not historical statements and  therefore  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation

with state and federal prison populations growing by approximately since  the private corrections industry has played an increasingly important role in addressing us detention and correctional needs 
the number of state and federal prisoners housed in private facilities has increased by since the year with the federal government and states such as arizona  texas and florida accounting for a significant portion of the increase 
at year end  of the estimated million state and federal prisoners incarcerated in the united states were held in private facilities  up from in in addition to our strong positions in texas and florida and in the us market in general  we believe we are the only publicly traded us correctional company with international operations 
with the existing operations in south africa  australia  and the united kingdom beginning  we believe that our international presence positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities within the private corrections and detention industry in new and established international markets 
we intend to pursue a diversified growth strategy by winning new customers and contracts  expanding our government services portfolio and pursuing selective acquisition opportunities 
we achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal  or rfp 
we primarily rely on the rfp process for organic growth in our us and international corrections operations as well as in our mental health and residential treatment services 
we believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective clients when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts 
our success in the rfp process has resulted in a pipeline of new projects with significant revenue potential 
in  we activated eight new or expansion projects representing  additional beds 
this compares to the eight new or expansion projects activated in representing  new beds 
as of january   we have three facilities under various stages of development or pending commencement of operations which represent  beds 
in addition to pursuing organic growth through the rfp process  we will from time to time selectively consider the financing and construction of new facilities or expansions to existing facilities on a speculative basis without having a signed contract with a known customer 
we also plan to leverage our experience to expand the range of government outsourced services that we provide 
we will continue to pursue selected acquisition opportunities in our core services and other government services areas that meet our criteria for growth and profitability 
revenue domestically  we continue to be encouraged by the number of opportunities that have recently developed in the privatized corrections and detention industry 
overcrowding at corrections facilities in various states  most recently california and arizona and increased demand for bed space at federal prisons and detention facilities are two of the factors that have contributed to the greater number of opportunities for privatization 
however  these positive trends may in the future be impacted by government budgetary constraints 
according to the national conference on state legislatures  as of november   thirty nine states were projecting that general fund revenues in fiscal year will be lower than in fiscal year and states projected budget gaps in fiscal year with the sum of those budget imbalances totaling billion 
as a result of budgetary pressures  state correctional agencies may pursue a number of cost savings initiatives which may include the early release of inmates  changes to parole laws and sentencing guidelines  and reductions in per diem rates and or the scope services provided by private operators 
these potential cost savings initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our current operations and or our ability to pursue new business opportunities 
additionally  if state budgetary constraints  as discussed above  persist or intensify  our state customers ability to pay us may be impaired and or we may be forced to renegotiate our management contracts on less favorable terms and our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be 
table of contents materially adversely impacted 
we plan to actively bid on any new projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
although we are pleased with the overall industry outlook  positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors  including budgetary constraints  unanticipated contract terminations  contract non renewals  and or contract re bids 
additionally  several of our management contracts are up for renewal and or re bid in although we have historically had a relative high contract renewal rate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our management contracts scheduled to expire in on favorable terms  or at all 
also  while we are pleased with our track record in re bid situations  we cannot assure that we will prevail in any such future situations 
internationally  in the united kingdom and in australia  we recently began the operation and management under two new contracts with an aggregate of  beds 
these projects commenced operations the second half of fiscal year in south africa  we have bid on projects for the design  construction and operation of four  bed prison projects totaling  beds 
requests for proposal were issued in december and we submitted our bids on the projects at the end of may we expect preferred bidders to be announced in the first half of and anticipate final close to occur within six months thereafter 
no more than two prison projects can be awarded to any one bidder 
we believe that additional opportunities will become available in international markets and plan to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
with respect to our mental health residential treatment services business conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  geo care  we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities 
in september  we acquired just care  and began management of the bed columbia care regional center in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  we continue to expend resources on informing state and local governments about the benefits of privatization and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts begin to yield results 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our correctional  detention and mental health facilities 
labor and related cost represented of our operating expenses in the fiscal year additional significant operating expenses include food  utilities and inmate medical costs 
in  operating expenses totaled of our consolidated revenues 
our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in will be impacted by the opening of any new facilities 
we also expect our results in to reflect increases to interest expense due to higher rates related to incremental borrowings on our senior credit facility  more average indebtedness and less capitalized interest due to a decrease in construction activity 
we also expect increases to depreciation expense due to the carrying costs we will incur for two newly constructed and expanded facilities for which we have no corresponding management contract for the expansion beds 
we expect that a portion of these increases may be offset by a savings to depreciation expense 
we are currently reviewing the useful lives for our owned facilities and expect that some of the lives of these assets may increase as a result 
overall  excluding any start up expenses  depreciation expense and interest expense  we anticipate that operating expenses as a percentage of our revenue will remain relatively flat  consistent with our fiscal year ended january  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
in  general and administrative expenses totaled of our consolidated revenues 
we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in to be generally consistent with our general and administrative expenses for we expect business development costs to remain consistent as we pursue additional business development opportunities in all of our business lines and build the corporate infrastructure necessary to support our mental health residential treatment services business 
we also plan to continue expending resources from time to time on the evaluation of potential acquisition targets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates with respect to our senior credit facility 
payments under the senior credit facility are indexed to a variable interest rate 
based on borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility portion of million as of january  for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility  our total annual interest expense would increase by million
