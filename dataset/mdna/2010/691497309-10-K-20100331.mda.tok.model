table of contents part i item business business and products overview we are an international apparel design  sourcing and marketing company featuring a diverse portfolio of owned and licensed lifestyle brands  company owned retail operations  and a collection of private label apparel businesses 
originally founded in  we have undergone a transformation as we migrated from our historical domestic manufacturing roots towards a focus on designing  sourcing and marketing apparel products bearing prominent trademarks owned by us 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own  compared to approximately in fiscal the key component of our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that are fashion right and evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers 
as part of this strategy  we strive to exploit the potential of our existing brands and products domestically and internationally and  as suitable opportunities arise  to acquire additional lifestyle brands that we believe fit within our business model 
we consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude  such as the tommy bahama and ben sherman brands 
we believe that by generating an emotional connection with our target consumer  lifestyle brands can command higher price points at retail  resulting in higher profits 
we also believe a successful lifestyle brand can provide opportunities for branded retail operations as well as licensing opportunities in product categories beyond our core business 
our strategy of emphasizing branded apparel products rather than private label products is driven in part by the continued consolidation in the retail industry and the increasing concentration of apparel manufacturing in a relatively limited number of offshore markets  two trends we believe are making the private label business generally more competitively challenging 
as we embarked on our brand focused business strategy  the first major step was our acquisition of the tommy bahama brand and operations in june then  in july  we acquired the ben sherman brand and operations 
in june  another significant step in this transition occurred with the divestiture of our former womenswear group operations  which produced private label women s sportswear  primarily for mass merchants 
in recent years  we have closed all but one of our manufacturing facilities 
since acquiring the tommy bahama and ben sherman brands  our investment in these brands has included expanding the number of tommy bahama and ben sherman retail stores 
we distribute our products through several wholesale distribution channels  including national chains  department stores  mass merchants  specialty stores  specialty catalog retailers and internet retailers 
most of our net sales are to customers located in the united states 
our largest customer  sears  inc  including its lands end business  represented approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal we also operate retail stores  restaurants and internet websites for some of our brands 
during fiscal direct to consumer sales from our retail stores  restaurants and internet websites accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
our business is operated through four operating groups consisting of tommy bahama  ben sherman  lanier clothes  and oxford apparel 

table of contents generally  each operating group is differentiated by its own distinctive brands or products  product styling  pricing strategies  distribution channels and target consumers 
each operating group is managed to maximize the return on capital invested and to develop its brands and operations in coordination with our overall strategic plans 
we believe that maintaining and growing our owned and licensed brands are critical to our success 
our owned brands include the following tommy bahama billy london ely ben sherman arnold brant cattleman nickelson oxford golf cumberland outfitters we currently hold licenses to produce and sell certain categories of apparel products under the following brands kenneth cole dockers geoffrey beene united states polo association sales of products using licensed brands accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal in addition to their branded sales  lanier clothes and oxford apparel also sell private label products  which comprised approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous u 
s based and foreign apparel firms compete 
additionally  the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
often  the impact of negative economic conditions may have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel and retail industry than the conditions would on other industries 
the weak global economic conditions that began in calendar year have continued to impact each of our operating groups  and we expect that the challenging economic conditions will continue to impact our operations in fiscal thus  all operating groups have planned inventory purchases for fiscal conservatively  which should mitigate inventory markdown risk and promotional pressure  however  this strategy will also limit our growth opportunities in the near term 
in the current economic environment  we also believe it is important that we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity 
we believe that the measures that we have taken to reduce working capital requirements  moderate our capital expenditures for retail stores  reduce our overhead and refinance our significant debt agreements in fiscal and fiscal have significantly enhanced our balance sheet and liquidity 
in addition to the impact of competition and economic factors  our operations are subject to certain other risks  many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict 
important factors relating to certain risks which could impact our business include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a

competition we sell our products in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous united states based and foreign apparel firms compete 
no single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design  brand image  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service

in some instances  particularly with respect to our private label businesses  a retailer that is our customer may compete directly with us by sourcing its products directly or by marketing its own private label brands 
important factors relating to risks associated with competitive factors in our industry include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
seasonal aspects of business and order backlog although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be seasonal 
for example  the demand for tommy bahama is higher in the spring season 
generally  our wholesale products are sold prior to each of the retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  we do not believe that results for any particular quarter are necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year 
the following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income by quarter unaudited for fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales operating income 
table of contents order backlog as of january  and january   we had booked orders totaling million and million  respectively  substantially all of which we expect will be or were shipped within six months after each such date 
once we receive a specific purchase order  the dollar value of such order is included in our booked orders 
a portion of our business consists of at once edi quick response programs with large retailers 
replenishment shipments under these programs generally have such an abbreviated order life that they are excluded from the order backlog completely 
we do not believe that this backlog information is necessarily indicative of sales to be expected for future periods 
trade regulation virtually all of the merchandise we import is subject to duties which are assessed on the value of an imported product 
duty rates vary depending on the fiber content of the garment 
silk products represent a significant portion of our tommy bahama products  but are generally subject to duty rates of less than compared to an average duty rate of approximately for our other non silk products 
from time to time and in the ordinary course of business  we become subject to claims by the united states customs service for duties and similar charges 
during fiscal  we sourced approximately of our products from china 
prior to january   our apparel merchandise produced in china was subject to quotas that limited the total quantity of garments that could be imported into the united states in a given year on a by product category basis 
though all quotas on chinese made textile and apparel products have been eliminated  the united states is still allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose anti dumping duties in response to a particular product being imported from another country in such increased quantities as to cause  or threaten to cause  serious damage to the comparable domestic us industry 
in addition  countervailing duties are other duties which can be imposed by the united states in cases where it finds that subsidies are being provided by a foreign government to its manufacturers and where this subsidized merchandise causes or threatens to cause damage to the comparable domestic us industry 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duty on products that we import would increase the cost of those products to us and we may not be able to pass on any such cost increases to our customers 
there have been some recent legislative proposals which  if adopted  would treat a manipulation by china of the value of its currency as actionable under the antidumping or countervailing duty laws 
in january  the united states customs service began enforcement of a new import regulation of importer security filings 
the new regulations require us to submit or provide for evidence of additional cargo information before cargo is loaded onto an ocean vessel bound for the united states 
we could become subject to penalties and or delays in obtaining our products from the united states customs service if we fail to comply with the new regulations 
the elimination of quotas on apparel and textiles among the world trade organization s member nations resulted in the shift of our sourcing and manufacturing activities from the western hemisphere to asia 
the trend away from western hemisphere sourcing and manufacturing is mitigated to some extent by various free trade agreements  such as the north american free trade agreement and the us peru free trade agreement 
we believe that by taking trade preference agreements and trade legislation into account in our sourcing decisions  we are and will continue to be effective in using trade regulation to our competitive advantage 
however  the elimination of  or certain changes to  these trade agreements or our inability to qualify for such free trade benefits would adversely impact our business by increasing our cost of goods sold and we may not be able to pass on any such cost increases to our customers 

table of contents we believe that with respect to the majority of our sourcing  we will continue to be able to procure our products from the most competitive countries because of the flexibility of our sourcing base 
while we have long term relationships with most of our major contract manufacturers  we do not have long term contractual commitments to them and retain the flexibility to move our production to alternative locations if market forces compel this 
the relative ease with which we can divert our sourcing  if necessary  from manufacturing facilities we have traditionally used allows us to shift our production relatively quickly to other countries which might become more competitive due to changes in the trade regulation environment or other unanticipated changes 
however  if we cannot shift our production in a timely manner or cannot find alternative sourcing at comparable prices  our cost of goods sold may increase and we may not be able to pass on any such cost increases to our customers 
apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulation in the united states and other countries by governmental agencies  including the federal trade commission  us fish and wildlife service and the consumer products safety commission 
these regulations relate principally to product labeling  licensing requirements and certification of product safety 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with those regulations 
our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation 
our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations  and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on our business or results of operations 
important factors relating to risks associated with trade regulation include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
employees as of january   we employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately were employed in the united states 
approximately of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees 
we believe our employee relations are good

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business faces many risks  many of which are outside of our control 
the following factors  as well as factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the sec that could materially affect our business  financial condition or operating results  should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impact our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected 
our business is and will continue to be heavily influenced by economic trends and general economic conditions 
economic conditions may continue to adversely affect our sales  increase our cost of goods sold or require us to significantly modify our business practices 
the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
often  the apparel industry tends to experience longer periods of recession and generally experiences greater declines than the general economy 
overall economic conditions that affect discretionary consumer spending include  but are not limited to  employment levels  recessions  energy costs  interest rates  tax rates  personal debt levels  housing prices and stock market volatility 
uncertainty about the future may also impact the level of discretionary consumer spending or result in shifts in consumer spending to products other than apparel 
any deterioration in general economic or political conditions  acts of war or terrorism or other factors that create uncertainty or alter the discretionary consumer habits in our key markets  particularly the united states and the united kingdom  could reduce our sales  increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify our current business practices and  consequently  harm our results of operations 
these and other events that impact our operating results could also result in adverse consequences to our business  such as our inability to comply with financial covenants under our debt instruments or to meet minimum sales thresholds to certain of our licensors 
the recent deterioration of the general economic environment  distress in the financial markets and general uncertainty about the economy have had  and are continuing to have  a significant negative impact on businesses and consumers around the world  including our own business 
these recessionary conditions have impacted retail sales of apparel and other consumer products 
reduced sales by our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels  reduced orders and or order cancellations 
reduced sales by these customers  along with the possibility of their reduced access to  or inability to access  the credit markets  may result in our customers experiencing significant financial difficulties 
financial difficulties of customers could result in reduced sales to those customers or could result in store closures  bankruptcies or liquidations by those customers 
higher credit risk relating to receivables from customers experiencing financial difficulty may result 
if these developments occur  our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our accounts receivable could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
these or any other significant changes in the operations or liquidity for any of the parties with which we conduct our business  including suppliers  customers  trademark licensees and lenders  among others  now or in the future  or in the access to capital markets for us or any such parties  could result in lower demand for our products  lower sales  higher costs or other disruptions in our business 
a significant portion of our revenues are direct to consumer through retail stores  restaurants and internet websites 
reduced consumer confidence  along with a reduction in the availability of consumer credit and increasing unemployment  has led  and may continue to lead  to reduced purchases of our products at our retail stores  restaurants and or internet websites  which could have a negative impact on the demand for our products and reduce our operating leverage 

table of contents additionally  during economic periods such as the recent conditions  certain long term commitments  such as leases and license agreements  may not be as beneficial in the short term as was desired when we initially entered into the agreements 
lease agreements and license agreements often require certain minimum payments which do not fluctuate with sales 
our ability to reduce these costs may be minimal  even if we determine to no longer utilize the retail space or trademark over a portion of the term of the agreement  as the other party may not be willing to renegotiate the agreement 
these long term agreements may result in higher costs as a percentage of sales than we originally anticipated or we realized in prior years and thus negatively impact our operating results in future periods 
we may be unable to successfully execute a key component of our business strategy  which is to grow our business through organic growth and or acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model  and any failure to successfully execute this aspect of our business strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
one key component of our business strategy is to grow our business through organic growth and or acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model 
organic growth may be achieved by  among other things  increasing our market share in existing markets  selling our products in new markets  increasing sales in our direct to consumer channels and increasing the product offerings within our various operating groups 
successful growth of our business through organic growth and or acquisitions is subject to  among other things  our ability to find suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices in the future and the ability of our management to implement plans for expanding our existing businesses 
we may not be successful in this regard  and our inability to grow our business may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the apparel industry is highly competitive  and we face significant competitive threats to our business from various third parties that could reduce our sales  increase our costs  reduce price points for our products  and or decrease margins 
the highly competitive apparel industry includes numerous domestic and foreign apparel designers  manufacturers  distributors  importers  licensors  and retailers  some of which may also be our customers and some of whom are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
the level and nature of our competition varies  and the number of our direct competitors and the intensity of competition may increase as we expand into other markets or product lines or as other companies expand into our markets or product lines 
some of our competitors may be able to adapt to changes in consumer demand more quickly  to devote greater resources to establishing brand recognition or to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
additionally  certain of our competitors offer apparel for sale at significant discounts  particularly in response to weak economic conditions  which results in more pressure to reduce prices or the risk that our products may not be as desirable as lower priced products 
in addition  with respect to certain of our businesses  retailers that are our customers may pose a significant competitive threat by sourcing their products directly or by marketing their own private label brands 
these private label lines may also receive prominent positioning on the retail floor 
these competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales  increased costs  lower prices for our products and or decreased margins 
our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
maintaining appropriate inventory levels in light of uncertain economic conditions presents a challenge to our business 
in light of the recent economic conditions  we believe we have planned inventory purchases for fiscal conservatively 
however  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory  which may result in 
table of contents inventory markdowns or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices 
these events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands 
conversely  we may not be in a position to order quality products from our manufacturers in a timely manner and or we may experience inventory shortages as demand for our products increases  which might result in unfilled orders  negatively impact customer relationships  diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues  any of which could harm our business 
our success depends on the reputation and value of our owned and licensed brand names  including  in particular  tommy bahama and ben sherman  and actions by us  our wholesale customers  licensees or others who have interests in our brands could diminish the reputation or value of our brands and adversely affect our business operations 
the success of our business depends on the reputation and value of our owned and licensed brand names 
the value of our brands could be diminished by actions taken by us  for instance by becoming overly promotional  or by our wholesale customers or others  including marketing partners  who have interests in the brands 
we cannot always control the marketing and promotion of our products by our wholesale customers or other third parties and actions by such parties that are inconsistent with our own marketing efforts or that otherwise adversely affect the appeal of our products could diminish the value or reputation of one or more of our brands and have an adverse effect on our sales and business operations 
in addition  we license certain of our brands  such as tommy bahama and ben sherman to third party licensees 
while we take significant steps to ensure the reputation of our brands is maintained through our license agreements  there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products outside of our core apparel products or due to the actions of a licensee 
the improper or detrimental actions of a licensee could significantly impact the perception of our brands 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends  and we must continuously offer innovative and market appropriate products to maintain and grow our existing businesses 
failure to offer innovative and market appropriate products may adversely affect our sales and lead to excess inventory  markdowns and or dilution of our brands 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design  brand image  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service 
although certain of our products carry over from season to season  the apparel industry in general is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  we must anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to continuously develop  source  market and deliver a wide variety of innovative  fashionable and desirable brands and products 
these products must be offered at appropriate price points in their respective distribution channels 
sales growth from our brands will depend largely upon our ability to continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identities 
due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry  there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumers preferences  fashion trends and changes in consumer demographics 
as is typical with new products  market acceptance of new price points and designs is subject to uncertainty 
the introduction or repositioning of new lines and products often requires substantial costs in design  marketing and advertising  which may not be recovered if the products are not successful 
any failure on our part to develop appealing products and update core products could result in lower sales and or harm the reputation and desirability of our brands 
additionally  since we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured  such a failure could leave us with a substantial amount of unsold excess inventory  which we 
table of contents may be forced to sell at lower price points 
any of these factors could result in a deterioration of the appeal of our brands and products  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business depends on our senior management and other key personnel  and the unexpected loss of individuals integral to our business  our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or our failure to successfully plan for and implement succession of our senior management and key personnel may have an adverse effect on our operations  business relationships and ability to execute our strategies 
our senior management has substantial experience and expertise in the apparel and related industries 
our success depends upon disciplined execution at all levels of our organization  including the members of our senior management 
competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense  and we compete to attract and retain these individuals with other companies which may have greater financial resources 
in addition  we will need to plan for the succession of our senior management and successfully integrate new members of management within our organization 
consistent with our management succession plan  we have recently introduced new leaders for each of our ben sherman  oxford apparel and lanier clothes groups 
the unexpected loss of any of our senior management  or the unsuccessful integration of new leadership  could negatively affect our operations  business relationships and ability to execute our strategies 
we depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our wholesale sales 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generate a significant percentage of our sales from a few major customers 
during fiscal  sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our total wholesale sales and sales to our largest wholesale customer represented approximately of our wholesale sales 
any further consolidation in the retail industry could result in a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products  restructuring of our customers operations  more centralized purchasing decisions  direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers  potentially resulting in lower prices  realignment of customer affiliations or other factors which could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generally do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
instead  we rely on long standing relationships with these customers and our position within the marketplace 
as a result  purchases generally occur on an order by order basis  and each relationship can generally be terminated by either party at any time 
a decision by one or more major customers to terminate its relationship with us or to reduce its purchases from us  whether motivated by competitive considerations  quality or style issues  financial difficulties  economic conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our net sales and profitability  as it would be difficult to immediately  if at all  replace this business with new customers or increase sales volumes with other existing customers 
in addition  due to long product lead times  several of our product lines are designed and manufactured in anticipation of orders for sale 
we make commitments for fabric and production in connection with these lines 
these commitments can be made up to several months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers  and if orders do not materialize or are canceled  we may incur expenses to terminate our fabric and production commitments or to dispose of excess inventories 
we also extend credit to several of our key customers without requiring collateral  which results in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers 
during the past several years  particularly in light of the recent economic crisis  companies in the apparel industry  including some of our customers  have had financial difficulties and have experienced tightened credit markets and declining sales and profitability on a comparable store basis 
if one or more of our key customers experiences significant problems in the future  including as a result of general weakness in the apparel industry  our sales may 
table of contents be reduced  and the risk associated with extending credit to these customers may increase 
a significant adverse change in a customer s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer s receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous shipments to that customer 
these or other events related to our significant customers could adversely affect our net sales and profitability 
our concentration of retail stores and wholesale customers for certain of our products exposes us to certain regional risks 
our retail locations are heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas in the united states  including florida and california for our tommy bahama retail stores and the united kingdom for our ben sherman retail stores 
as of january   out of our tommy bahama retail stores were located in these two us states and almost half of our ben sherman full price retail stores were located in the united kingdom 
additionally  a significant portion of our wholesale sales for tommy bahama and ben sherman products are concentrated in the same geographic areas as our own retail store locations for these brands 
due to this concentration  we have heightened exposure to factors that impact these regions  including general economic conditions  weather patterns  natural disasters  changing demographics and other factors 
our foreign sourcing operations as well as the sale of products in foreign markets result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to certain risks in conducting business outside of the united states 
substantially all of our orders for the production of apparel in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  either of which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future  then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to customers  which would negatively impact our margins 
if the value of the us dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product  the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by competitors that pay for goods in local currencies  and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices 
additionally  currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance 
we received us dollars for approximately of our product sales during fiscal the sales denominated in foreign currencies primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
an increase in the value of the us dollar compared to these other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of operations  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods 
in addition  to the extent that the stronger us dollar increases costs  and the products are sold in another currency  but the additional cost cannot be passed on to our customers  our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our exposure to foreign currency risk except that  on occasion  we do purchase foreign currency forward exchange contracts for our goods purchased on us dollar terms that are expected to be sold in the united kingdom and europe 
divestitures of certain businesses or discontinuations of certain product lines may require us to find alternative uses for our resources 
we may determine that it is appropriate to divest or discontinue certain operations 
divestitures of certain businesses that do not align with our strategy or the discontinuation of certain product lines 
table of contents which may not provide the returns that we expect or desire may result in underutilization of our resources in the event that the operations are not replaced with new lines of business either internally or through acquisition 
there can be no guarantee that if we divest certain businesses or discontinue certain product lines that we will be able to replace the sales and profits related to these businesses or appropriately utilize our remaining resources  which may result in a decline in our operating results and or result in an inappropriate capitalization of our organization 
we make use of debt to finance our operations  which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business  financial position and operating results 
our levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business  investments in acquisitions and working capital and divestitures 
as of january  we had approximately million of outstanding senior secured notes and no borrowings outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement  which subject to the applicable conditions contained therein  has a loan commitment of up to million  or our uk revolving credit agreement  which has a loan commitment of up to million 
our debt levels may increase in the future under our existing facilities or potentially under new facilities  or the terms or forms of our financing arrangements in the future may change  which may increase our exposure to the items discussed below 
in august  we entered into our us revolving credit agreement  which amended and restated the prior credit agreement  which was scheduled to mature in july our us revolving credit agreement matures in august our us revolving credit agreement provides for an asset based facility  with borrowing availability determined primarily by the level of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 
we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations and the projected borrowing availability under our us revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements 
however  if we do not have a sufficient borrowing base at any given time  borrowing availability under our us revolving credit agreement may not be sufficient to support our liquidity needs 
additionally  if any of the financial institutions that are parties to our us revolving credit agreement were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent  they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us 
this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity 
in addition  in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes with a scheduled maturity of july the net proceeds from the sale of the senior secured notes  together with borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement  were used to satisfy and discharge then outstanding senior unsecured notes  which were scheduled to mature in june the senior secured notes have a higher interest rate than the senior unsecured notes had  which will increase our interest expense 
the increased interest expense may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt obligations  require us to dedicate a more significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for operations  future business opportunities or other purposes  such as funding our working capital and capital expenditures  and or limit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future 
our indebtedness includes  and any future indebtedness may include  certain obligations and limitations  including the periodic payment of principal and interest  maintenance of certain covenants and certain other limitations related to additional debt  dividend payments  investments and dispositions of assets 
our ability to satisfy these obligations will be dependent upon our business  financial condition and operating results 
these obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plan and planning for  or reacting to  changes in the industry in which we operate 

table of contents we have interest rate risk on a portion of our indebtedness  as certain of our indebtedness is based on variable interest rates 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk 
an increase in interest rates may require us to pay a greater amount of our funds from operations towards interest  even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same 
as a result  we may have to revise or delay our business plans  reduce or delay capital expenditures or otherwise adjust our plans for operations 
we are dependent upon the availability of raw materials and the ability of our third party producers  substantially all of whom are located in foreign countries  to meet our requirements  any failures by these producers to meet our requirements  or the unavailability of suitable producers or raw materials at reasonable prices may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales 
we source substantially all of our products from non exclusive  third party producers located in foreign countries 
although we place a high value on long term relationships with our suppliers  generally we do not have long term contracts but  instead  conduct business on an order by order basis 
therefore  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers 
we regularly depend upon the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials  adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity 
although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations  we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers  such as the reduction of availability of production capacity  errors in complying with product specifications  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis  which may  in turn  have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales 
most of the products we purchase from third party producers are package purchases  and we and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices 
the principal fabrics used in our business are cotton  linens  wools  silk  other natural fibers  synthetics and blends of these materials 
the prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them 
the price and availability of certain raw materials have fluctuated in the past  and may fluctuate in the future  depending on a variety of factors  including crop yields  weather  supply conditions  government regulation  war  terrorism  labor unrest  global health concerns  economic climate  the cost of petroleum and other unpredictable factors 
additionally  costs incurred by our third party providers or our transportation costs may increase due to these same factors 
we historically have not entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices 
any significant increase in the price of raw materials or decrease in the availability of raw materials could cause delays in product deliveries to our customers  which could have an adverse impact on our customer relationships and or increase our costs  some or all of which we may be unable to pass on to our customers 
we also require third party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions  environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them 
as a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards  we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products 
in addition  the labor and business practices of independent apparel manufacturers have received increased attention from the media  non governmental organizations  consumers and governmental agencies in recent years 
failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical  and the potential litigation  negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events  could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation 

table of contents since we source substantially all of our products from third party producers located in foreign countries  our business is subject to legal  regulatory  political and economic risks  including risks relating to the importation of our products  and our products may become less competitive as a result of adverse changes affecting our international operations 
as we source substantially all of our products from foreign countries  including approximately of our product purchases from china during fiscal  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate 
some of the risks associated with importing our products from foreign countries include quotas imposed by countries in which our products are manufactured or countries into which our products are imported  which limit the amount and type of goods that may be imported annually from or into these countries  changes in social  political  labor and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers are located  the imposition of additional or new duties  tariffs  taxes or other charges and shifts in sourcing patterns as a result of such charges  significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  significant delays in the delivery of our products  due to security considerations  rapid fluctuations in sourcing costs  including costs for raw materials and labor  the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties  fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  and restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries 
we currently benefit from duty free treatment under international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement 
in addition  china s safeguard quota on certain classes of apparel products expired on december  though all quotas on chinese made textile and apparel products are currently eliminated  the imposition of a new quota arrangement between the united states and china or the elimination of duty free treatment or our inability to qualify for such benefits would adversely impact our business by increasing our cost of goods sold 
our products are subject to increasingly stringent and complex product performance and safety standards  laws and other regulations  such as the consumer product safety improvement act of complying with new regulations could result in greater expense  and failure to comply with such regulations could result in a delay  non delivery or mandated destruction of inventory shipments during key seasons or other financial penalties 
while we intend to abide by applicable laws or regulations  significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws could harm our reputation  our business relationships or our ability to execute our strategies 
our  or any of our suppliers  failure to comply with customs or similar laws or any other applicable regulations could restrict our ability to import products or lead to fines  penalties or adverse publicity  and future regulatory actions or trade agreements may provide our competitors with a material advantage over us or materially increase our costs 

table of contents our operations are reliant on information technology  and any interruption or other failure in our information technology systems may impair our ability to compete effectively in the apparel industry  including our ability to provide services to our customers and meet the needs of management 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology 
information systems are used in all stages of our operations from design to distribution and as a method of communication with our customers and suppliers 
additionally  certain of our operating groups utilize e commerce websites to sell goods directly to consumers 
our management also relies on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information in order to allocate resources and forecast and report our operating results 
service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors  including computer viruses  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  disasters  or failures to properly install  upgrade  integrate  protect  repair or maintain our systems and e commerce websites 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we converted certain of our financial systems in our united states operations to a new integrated financial system 
as a result of these conversions  we modified certain internal controls over financial reporting 
we anticipate converting other of our financial systems and certain other geographic regions to the new integrated financial system in future periods 
difficulties migrating existing financial systems to the new software could cause difficulties in operating our business and communicating with our customers or our ability to report our financial results  which could cause our sales and profits to decrease and could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such difficulties 
additionally  future assessments of the appropriateness and relevance of our financial and operational systems could result in a change to or additional replacements of our systems in the future 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in developing or acquiring competitive systems which are responsive to our needs and the needs of our customers 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property or may otherwise have our brand names harmed 
we believe that our registered and common law trademarks and other intellectual property  as well as other contractual arrangements  including licenses and other proprietary intellectual property rights  have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers 
approximately of our net sales in fiscal was attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark 
therefore  our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property 
we rely on laws in the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization  particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed  causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm the reputation of our brands 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark disputes  as we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
in the event a claim of infringement against us is successful  we may be required to pay damages  royalties or license fees to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using  or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time 
litigation and other legal action of this type  
table of contents regardless of whether it is successful  could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources 
our sales and operating results are influenced by weather patterns and natural disasters 
like other companies in the apparel industry  our sales volume may be adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions or natural disasters  which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations 
because of the seasonality of our business and the concentration of a significant proportion of our customers in certain geographic regions  the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are dependent on a limited number of distribution centers  making our operations particularly susceptible to disruption 
our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our primary distribution facilities  some of which are owned and others of which are operated by third parties 
finished garments from our contractors are inspected and stored at these distribution facilities 
if any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  or if the goods in the distribution center were otherwise unavailable for shipment  we could experience a reduction in sales  a substantial loss of inventory or higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility 
this could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships 
we may not be successful in identifying locations and negotiating appropriate lease terms for retail stores and restaurants 
an integral part of our strategy has been to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our brands 
net sales from retail stores and restaurants were approximately of our consolidated net sales during fiscal successful operation of our retail stores and restaurants depends  in part  on the overall ability of the retail location to attract a consumer base sufficient to make store sales volume profitable 
if we are unable to identify new locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level  retail growth may consequently be limited 
further  if existing retail stores and restaurants do not maintain a sufficient customer base that provides a reasonable sales volume  it could have a negative impact on our sales  gross margin  and results of operations 
in addition  there has been some recent consolidation among commercial real estate developers  mall operators and or shopping center managers 
significant consolidation within the commercial real estate development  operation and or management industries impacting locations where we might operate retail stores and or restaurants or that we might otherwise consider desirable could reduce our leverage with such parties  thereby materially adversely affecting the terms of future leases for our retail stores and restaurants or making entering into long term commitments with such parties cost prohibitive 
our business  in particular our retail and restaurant operations  is subject to state and local laws and regulations for health  safety  labor and similar operational issues 
the costs of compliance with  or the violation of  such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our costs or operations  and we may be adversely impacted by negative publicity surrounding any of these issues 
we operated retail stores and restaurants in numerous states as of january  our retail and restaurant operations are subject to comprehensive state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of employment  safety and other matters 
the complexity of these laws and regulations to which we are subject  which may vary widely by jurisdiction  makes it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently  
table of contents or will be in the future  compliant with all laws and regulations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business 
in addition  the restaurant industry is highly competitive and requires compliance with a variety of federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  all of our tommy bahama restaurants serve alcohol and  therefore  maintain liquor licenses 
our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of a restaurant 
additionally  as a participant in the restaurant industry  we face risks related to food quality  food borne illness  injury  health inspection scores and labor relations 
regardless of whether allegations related to these matters are valid or whether we become liable  we may be materially affected by negative publicity associated with these issues 
the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants  as well as the image of the tommy bahama brand as a whole 
we hold licenses for the use of other parties brand names  and we cannot guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names 
we have entered into license and design agreements to use certain trademarks and trade names  such as kenneth cole  dockers  united states polo association and geoffrey beene  to market our products 
approximately of our net sales during fiscal related to the products for which we license the use of the trademark for specific product categories 
these license and design agreements will expire at various dates in the future 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks 
the termination or expiration of a license agreement will cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license and in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets 
in addition to certain compliance obligations  all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year  which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products 
if these thresholds are not met  our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved 
in addition  our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties  and we are unable to control the quality of these goods that others produce 
if licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates  our sales and any associated profits generated by such brands may decline 
the acquisition of new businesses has certain inherent risks  including  for example  strains on our management team and unexpected acquisition costs 
one component of our business strategy is the acquisition of new businesses or product lines as and when appropriate investment opportunities are available 
evaluating and completing acquisitions in the future may strain our administrative  operational and financial resources and distract our management from our ongoing businesses 
in addition  integrating acquired businesses is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
the integration process for newly acquired businesses could create for us a number of challenges and adverse consequences associated with the integration of product lines  employees  sales teams and outsourced manufacturers  employee turnover  including key management and creative personnel of the acquired and existing businesses  disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines  maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of 
table of contents relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses 
further  we may not be able to manage the combined operations and assets effectively or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
as a result of acquisitions that have occurred or may occur in the future  we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with the acquired businesses 
we cannot be assured that any indemnification to which we may be entitled from the sellers will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business acquired 
we operate in various countries with differing laws and regulations  which may impair our ability to maintain compliance with regulations and laws 
although we attempt to abide by the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate  the complexity of the laws and regulations to which we are subject  including customs regulations  labor laws  competition laws  consumer protection laws and domestic and international tax legislation  makes it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently  or will be in the future  compliant with all laws and regulations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business 
compliance with privacy and information laws and requirements could be costly  and a breach of information security or privacy could adversely affect our business 
the regulatory environment governing our use of individually identifiable data of customers  employees and others is complex and a matter of growing public concern 
privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently  and compliance with them may require us to incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes 
if a data security breach occurs  our reputation could be damaged and we could experience lost sales  fines or lawsuits

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our operations  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
overview we generate revenues and cash flow primarily through the design  production  sale and distribution of branded and private label consumer apparel for men and women and the licensing of company owned trademarks 
our principal markets and customers are located in the united states and  to a lesser extent  the united kingdom 
we source substantially all of our products through third party manufacturers located outside of the united states and united kingdom 
we distribute the majority of our products through our wholesale customers  which include chain stores  department stores  specialty stores  specialty catalog retailers  mass merchants and internet retailers 
we also sell products of certain owned brands through our owned and licensed retail stores and e commerce websites 
as a result of the weak global economic conditions  fiscal and fiscal were particularly challenging years for each of our operating groups 
we expect that these challenging economic conditions will continue to impact each of our operating groups in fiscal thus  we have planned inventory purchases for fiscal conservatively in all operating groups  which should mitigate inventory markdown risk and promotional pressure  however  this strategy will also limit our growth opportunities in the near term 
in the current economic environment  we also believe it is important to continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity 
we believe that the measures we have taken to reduce working capital requirements  moderate capital expenditures for retail stores  reduce our overhead and refinance our significant debt agreements in fiscal and fiscal have significantly enhanced our balance sheet and liquidity 
the apparel and retail industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
the impact of negative economic conditions may have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel and retail industry than the same conditions would have on other industries 
therefore  even if conditions improve in the general economy  the negative impact on the apparel and retail industry may continue 
the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results in thousands  except per share amounts for fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal fiscal change net sales net earnings loss diluted net earnings loss per common share weighted average common shares outstanding diluted the primary reasons for the improvement in diluted net earnings per common share were fiscal results were negatively impacted by million of impairment charges related to goodwill  intangible assets and an investment in an unconsolidated entity

table of contents a charge of million which was recognized in interest expense in fiscal as a result of our amendment and restatement of our us revolving credit agreement 
the net impact of various changes in our debt facilities which impacted interest expense  net including the amendment and restatement of our us revolving credit agreement in august which provided more favorable borrowing terms than the us revolving credit agreement provided for prior to august  our repurchase of million of our senior unsecured notes at a discount in fiscal  the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in fiscal  the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes in fiscal  which was funded by the proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes and borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement and varying levels of debt outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement between the two periods as a result of positive cash flows in fiscal these items were partially offset by the decline in net sales for each operating group  which was primarily due to the continued impact of the challenging economic conditions 
the negative impact on ben sherman operating results related to the change in the average exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the united states dollar and restructuring charges totaling approximately million in fiscal  which were primarily related to our exit from the ben sherman women s  kids and footwear operations  as well as other streamlining initiatives 
the impact on net sales for lanier clothes and oxford apparel resulting from our exit from certain businesses in fiscal the decrease in royalty income primarily as a result of the termination of the tommy bahama footwear license agreement  a decline in the average value of the british pound sterling versus the united states dollar  which impacted ben sherman royalty income and the impact of the challenging economic conditions

table of contents change in method of accounting for certain inventory during fiscal  we changed our method of accounting for certain of our domestic inventory from the first in  first out fifo method to the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
subsequent to this change in method of accounting for this portion of our inventory  all domestic wholesale and retail inventory is accounted for using the lifo method and all of our international wholesale and retail inventory continues to be accounted for using the fifo method 
we believe this change is preferable as the lifo method provides uniformity and consistency across all of our domestic operations with respect to the method of inventory accounting 
the change in accounting principle had a material impact on certain periods compared to what was previously reported 
in accordance with us gaap  all prior year and prior quarter amounts included in this annual report have been retrospectively modified to reflect the change in accounting principle 
other than the change in corporate and other  there is no impact on the operating results of our operating groups as the impact of lifo accounting is not allocated to operating groups  but instead recorded in corporate and other as our lifo pool is not consistent with our operating groups

the increase was primarily due to the recognition of additional deferred rent and deferred compensation during the twelve months subsequent to february  and the reclassification of approximately million to other non current liabilities from income taxes payable and non current deferred income taxes as a result of the adoption of new guidance related to uncertain tax positions in the first quarter of the eight month transition period ended february  non current deferred income taxes were million and million at february  and february   respectively

non current assets  including property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets and other non current assets  increased from february  to february   primarily as a result of the fiscal and cumulative earn out related to the tommy bahama acquisition  the acquisition of tommy bahama s buying agent and capital expenditures for our retail stores 
these increases were partially offset by depreciation related to our property  plant and equipment and amortization of our intangible assets

proceeds from the senior secured notes and borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement were used to fund the satisfaction and discharge of the senior unsecured notes outstanding at that time 
our credit facilities are used to finance trade letters of credit  as well to provide funding for other operating activities  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
as of january   approximately million of trade letters of credit and other limitations on availability in the aggregate were outstanding against the us revolving credit agreement and the us revolving credit agreement 
on january   we had approximately million and million in unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement and the uk revolving credit agreement  respectively  subject to the respective limitations on borrowings set forth in the us revolving credit agreement  us revolving credit agreement and the indenture for the senior secured notes 

table of contents covenants  other restrictions and prepayment penalties our credit facilities and senior secured notes are subject to a number of affirmative covenants regarding the delivery of financial information  compliance with law  maintenance of property  insurance and conduct of business

our us revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant that applies if unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement for three consecutive days is less than the greater of i million or ii of the total revolving commitments 
in such case  our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the us revolving credit agreement must not be less than to for the immediately preceding fiscal months for which financial statements have been delivered 
this financial covenant continues to apply until we have maintained unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement of more than the greater of i million or ii of the total revolving commitments for consecutive days 
additionally  pursuant to the indenture governing our senior secured notes  our ability to incur certain indebtedness or to make certain restricted payments  as defined in the indenture  is subject to our meeting certain conditions  including in each case the condition that our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the indenture  not be less than to for the preceding four fiscal quarters on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the proposed indebtedness or restricted payment and  in the case of a restricted payment  the condition that the aggregate total of all restricted payments not exceed a certain allowable amount calculated pursuant to a formula set forth in the indenture 
restricted payments under the indenture include  without limitation  cash dividends to shareholders  repurchases of our capital stock  and certain investments 
we believe that the affirmative covenants  negative covenants  financial covenants and other restrictions are customary for those included in similar facilities and notes entered into at the time we entered into our agreements 
as of january   no financial covenant testing was required pursuant to our us revolving credit agreement as the minimum availability threshold was met during the quarter

our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally existing in the fall and spring of each year 
our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the need to finance inventory levels and the success of our various products 
at maturity of the us revolving credit agreement and the senior secured notes or if the uk revolving credit agreement was required to be paid  we anticipate that we will be able to refinance the facilities and debt with terms available in the market at that time  which may or may not be as favorable as the terms of the current agreements

such amounts incurred in fiscal totaled approximately million 
interest amounts payable in future periods on our us revolving credit agreement and uk revolving credit agreement have been excluded from the table above  as the amount that will be outstanding and interest rate during any fiscal year will be dependent upon future events which are not known at this time

dividend declaration on march   our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share payable on april  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on april  although  we have paid dividends in each quarter since we became a public company in july  we may discontinue or modify dividend payments at any time if we determine that other uses of our capital  including but not limited to  payment of outstanding debt  repurchases of outstanding shares or funding of future acquisitions  may be in our best interest  if our expectations of future cash flows and future cash needs outweigh the ability to pay a dividend  or if the terms of our credit facilities  the indenture for the senior secured notes or other debt instruments limit our ability to pay dividends 
we may borrow to fund dividends in the short term based on our expectation of operating cash flows in future periods subject to the terms and conditions of our credit facilities  the indenture for the senior secured notes or other debt instruments 
all cash flow from operations will not necessarily be paid out as dividends in all periods

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivables  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
table of contents other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies 
however  in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below  our consolidated statements of operations could be misstated 
the detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies  estimates and methods we use 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenue consists of wholesale  retail store  e commerce and restaurant sales 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business we offer certain discounts or allowances to our wholesale customers 
wholesale operations sales are recorded net of such discounts and allowances  as well as advertising support not specifically relating to the reimbursement for actual advertising expenses by our customers and provisions for estimated returns 
as certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season  program or other event which may not have occurred yet  we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis 
significant considerations in determining our estimates for discounts  returns and allowances for wholesale customers include historical and current trends  agreements with customers  projected seasonal results  an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance 
actual discounts and allowances to our wholesale customers have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods 
as of january   our total reserves for discounts and allowances were approximately million and  therefore  if the allowances changed by it would have a pre tax impact of million on net earnings loss 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken as a reduction to accounts receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize estimated reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience  the financial condition of our customers  an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends  each of which is subjective and requires certain assumptions 
actual charges for uncollectible amounts have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  and therefore  if the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by it would have a pre tax impact of approximately million on net earnings loss 
inventories  net for operating group reporting  inventory is carried at the lower of the first in  first out fifo method cost or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories for identification of distressed inventory 
in performing this evaluation we consider slow turning products  prior seasons fashion products and current levels of replenishment program products as compared to future sales estimates 
for wholesale inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods as necessary 
for retail inventory  we provide an allowance for shrinkage and goods expected to be sold below cost 
as the amount to be ultimately realized for the goods is not necessarily known at period end  we must utilize certain assumptions considering historical experience  the age of the inventory  inventory quantity  quality and mix  historical sales trends  future sales projections  consumer and retailer preferences  market trends and general economic conditions 

table of contents for consolidated financial reporting  approximately million of our inventories are valued at the lower of last in  first out lifo method cost or market after deducting the million lifo reserve as of january  approximately million of our inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market as of january  as of january  and january   approximately and  respectively  of our inventories are accounted for using the lifo method 
generally  our inventories valued at the lower of lifo cost or market relate to our domestic operations and our inventories valued at the lower of fifo cost or market relate to our international operations 
lifo inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the respective operating groups as lifo inventory pools do not correspond to our operating group definitions 
lifo reserves are based on the producer price index as published by the united states department of labor 
we write down inventories valued at the lower of lifo cost or market when lifo exceeds market value 
for operating group reporting purposes included in note to our consolidated financial statements and in the results of operations in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report  the impact of lifo accounting is included in corporate and other 
as of january   we had recorded a reserve of approximately million related to inventory on the lower of fifo cost or market method 
a change in the amount of markdowns for inventory valued on the lower of fifo cost or market method as of january  would have a pre tax impact of approximately million on net earnings 
a change in the markdowns of our inventory valued at the lower of lifo cost or market method would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements due to the existence of our significant lifo reserve of million as of january  a change in inventory levels at the end of future years compared to inventory balances as of january  could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as such a change may erode portions of our earlier base year layers for purposes of making our annual lifo computation 
during fiscal  for consolidated financial reporting  we changed our method of accounting for a portion of our domestic inventory from the fifo method to the lifo method of accounting 
this change relates to the portion of our domestic wholesale and retail inventory which was previously accounted for using the fifo method 
we believe this change is preferable as the lifo method provides uniformity and consistency across our domestic operations with respect to the method of inventory accounting 
as a result of this change in method of accounting for this portion of our inventory  all domestic wholesale and retail inventory is accounted for using the lifo method while all of our international wholesale and retail inventory continues to be accounted for using the fifo method 
the change in accounting principle had a material impact on certain periods from what was previously reported 
in accordance with us gaap  all prior year and prior quarter amounts included in this annual report have been retrospectively modified to reflect the change in accounting principle 
other than the change in corporate and other  there is no impact on the operating results of our operating groups as the impact of lifo accounting is not allocated to operating groups  but instead recorded in corporate and other as lifo pools are not consistent with our operating groups 
goodwill  net goodwill is recognized as the amount by which the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition 
such goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit at the time of acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill includes valuations of each applicable underlying business using fair value techniques and market comparables which may include a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal 
significant estimates  some of which require subjective judgment  included in such a valuation include future cash flow projections of 
table of contents the business  which are based on our future expectations for the business 
additionally  the discount rate used in this analysis is an estimate of the risk adjusted market based cost of capital 
in addition to the annual impairment test  we use certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  such as i negative operating cash flow or a forecast that demonstrates declines in the operating cash flow of a reporting unit or the inability of a reporting unit to improve its operations to appropriate levels  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an entity and iii whether the book value of our shareholders equity exceeds our market capitalization 
a decrease in our market capitalization resulting from a decrease in our stock price  or a negative long term performance outlook  could cause the carrying value of our reporting units to exceed their fair values  which may result in an impairment loss 
if our analysis indicates an impairment of goodwill balances  the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal the price of our common stock declined significantly  particularly late in the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter 
as of january   the carrying value of our net assets exceeded the fair value of our net assets  measured as market capitalization of our outstanding common stock  plus a reasonable control premium  and the fair value of our outstanding debt 
the analysis comparing our enterprise fair value to our book value along with consideration of the actual and projected results of our reporting units indicated that it was appropriate to write off all goodwill in tommy bahama  ben sherman and oxford apparel in fiscal  resulting in a total goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
intangible assets  net intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  totaled approximately million  which includes approximately million with finite lives and million with indefinite lives 
at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consist of trademarks and trade names  license agreements and customer relationships 
the fair values and useful lives of these intangible assets are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases 
such valuation may include a discounted cash flow analysis of anticipated revenues or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset using an estimate of a risk adjusted market based cost of capital as the discount rate 
amortization of intangible assets with finite lives  which consist of license agreements  certain trademarks  customer relationships and covenants not to compete  is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized 
we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives for periods of up to years 
the determination of an appropriate useful life for amortization is based on our plans for the intangible asset as well as factors outside of our control 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if expected future undiscounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts  an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
amortization related to intangible assets with finite lives totaled million during fiscal trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of trademarks with indefinite lives includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the relief from royalty method  among other considerations 
this approach is dependent upon a number of uncertain factors including estimates of future net sales  growth rates  royalty rates for the trademarks and discount rates 
such estimates involve significant 
table of contents uncertainty  and if our plans or anticipated results change  the impact on our financial statements could be significant 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of a trademark with an indefinite useful life  the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
as a result of the impact of the difficult economic conditions on the operations of tommy bahama and ben sherman as well as the use of higher discount rates than used in prior years  we recognized approximately million of impairment charges related to assets with indefinite lives in fiscal charges of million and million were recognized in tommy bahama and ben sherman  respectively 
the fiscal impairment charges related to intangible assets resulted in a tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal no impairment charges related to intangible assets were recognized 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes for a company with global operations 
the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain for many transactions 
our provisions are based on federal and projected state statutory rates and take into account our quarterly assessment of permanent book tax differences  income tax credits and uncertain tax positions 
we estimate the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  the estimate is refined based upon actual events and earnings loss by jurisdiction and to reflect changes in our judgment of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions 
this estimation process periodically results in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
income tax expense may also be adjusted for discrete events occurring during the year  such as the enactment of tax rate changes or changes in uncertain tax positions  which are reflected in the quarter that the changes occur 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements 
seasonality although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be seasonal 
for example  the demand for tommy bahama in our principal markets is higher in the spring season 
generally  our wholesale products are sold prior to each of the retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  we do not believe that results for any particular quarter are necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year 
the following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income by quarter unaudited for fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales operating income 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our indebtedness  which could impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
our objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow  primarily through a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
this assessment also considers our need for flexibility in our borrowing arrangements resulting from the seasonality of our business  among other factors 
we continuously monitor interest rates to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities in order to determine whether we have achieved our interest rate management objectives 
as of january   we had no debt outstanding which was subject to variable interest rates  although we did have debt subject to variable interest rates outstanding during fiscal our average variable rate borrowings for fiscal were million  with an average interest rate of during the year 
our lines of credit are based on variable interest rates in order to provide the necessary borrowing flexibility we require 
to the extent that the amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credit change  our exposure to changes in interest rates would also change 
based on the average variable rate borrowings outstanding for fiscal  if our average interest rates increased by basis points  our interest expense for fiscal would increase by approximately million 
although we do anticipate having some borrowings under our variable rate lines of credits during fiscal  we do not believe that borrowings and interest rates  and therefore interest expense  for fiscal are necessarily indicative of borrowings in future periods 
if we change our capital structure or acquire additional businesses in the future  such a transaction would impact our interest expense in future periods 
as of january   we had approximately million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt outstanding  consisting of our senior secured notes  which have an effective interest rate of and mature in july such fixed rate debt may result in higher interest expense than could be obtained under variable interest rate arrangements in certain periods  but is primarily intended to provide long term financing of our capital structure and minimize our exposure to increases in interest rates 
a change in the market interest rate impacts the fair value of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
none of our debt was entered into for speculative purposes 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk and generally do not enter into such transactions on a speculative basis 
foreign currency risk to the extent that we have assets and liabilities  as well as operations  denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
we view our foreign investments as long term and  as a result  we generally do not hedge such foreign investments 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments related to foreign currency exposure for speculative purposes 
we receive united states dollars for most of our product sales 
however  approximately of our net sales for fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
these sales primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom  europe and asia 
a strengthening united states dollar could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts as previously reported 
based on our net sales during fiscal denominated in foreign currencies  if the dollar had strengthened by an additional in fiscal we would have experienced an additional decrease in sales of approximately million 

table of contents substantially all of our inventory purchases  including goods for operations in the united kingdom  from contract manufacturers throughout the world are denominated in united states dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
additionally  to the extent that the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the currency that the inventory will be sold in changes  the gross margins of those businesses could be impacted significantly 
we may from time to time purchase short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and at january   we had approximately million of such contracts entered into that were unsettled 
during fiscal  foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding did not exceed million at any time 
when such contracts are outstanding  the contracts are marked to market with the offset being recognized in our consolidated statement of operations or other comprehensive income if the transaction does not or does  respectively  qualify as a hedge in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
commodity and inflation risk we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials and finished goods and increased operating costs to the extent that any such fluctuations are not reflected by adjustments in the selling prices of our products 
inflation deflation risks are managed by each operating group through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives 
we do not enter into significant long term sales or purchase contracts  and we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such risk
