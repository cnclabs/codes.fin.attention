item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
explanatory note on july   alpha natural resources  inc old alpha and foundation coal holdings  inc foundation merged the merger with foundation continuing as the surviving legal corporation of the merger which was renamed alpha natural resources  inc alpha 
for accounting purposes  the merger is treated as a reverse acquisition with old alpha considered the accounting acquirer 
accordingly  old alpha s historical financial statements are included in periodic filings of alpha subsequent to the merger 
the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  include the results of operations from old alpha for the period january  to july  and include the results of operations of the combined company for the five month period august  to december  unless we have indicated otherwise  or the context otherwise requires  references in this report to alpha  we  us and our or similar terms are to alpha and its consolidated subsidiaries in reference to dates subsequent to the merger and to old alpha and its consolidated subsidiaries in reference to dates prior to the merger 
overview we are one of america s premier coal suppliers  ranked third largest among publicly traded us coal producers as measured by combined old alpha and foundation and pro forma revenues of billion and billion  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are the nation s leading supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal for use in the steel making process and a major supplier of thermal coal to electric utilities and manufacturing industries across the country 
we operate mines and coal preparation and load out facilities in northern and central appalachia and the powder river basin  with approximately  employees 
we produce  process  and sell steam and metallurgical coal from six business units located throughout virginia  west virginia  kentucky  pennsylvania  and wyoming 
we also sell coal produced by others  the majority of which we process and or blend with coal produced from our mines prior to resale  providing us with a higher overall margin for the blended product than if we had sold the coals separately 
our sales of steam coal in and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume  and our sales of metallurgical coal in and  which generally sells at a premium over steam coal  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume 
the effect of the merger on the relative percentages of coal sales volumes for is discussed below in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our sales of steam coal during and were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers throughout the united states  and our sales of metallurgical coal during and were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the united states and in several countries in europe  asia and south america 
approximately and of our coal revenues combined with freight and handling revenues in and  respectively  were derived from sales made outside the united states  primarily in brazil  italy  belgium  canada  spain  egypt  turkey and russia 
in addition  we generate other revenues from equipment and parts sales and repair  dry systems technologies equipment and filters  road construction  rentals  commissions  coal handling  terminal and processing fees  coal and environmental analysis fees  royalties  override royalty payments from a coal supply agreement now fulfilled by another producer  fees to transload coal through our rivereagle facility on the big sandy river and the sale of coalbed methane and natural gas 
we also record revenue for freight and handling charges incurred in delivering coal to certain customers  for which we are reimbursed by our customers 
as such  freight and handling revenues are offset by equivalent freight and handling costs and do not contribute to our profitability 
our primary expenses are for operating supply costs  repair and maintenance expenditures  cost of purchased coal  royalties  current wages and benefits  postretirement and post employment benefits  freight and handling costs  and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
historically  our cost of coal sales per ton is lower for sales of our produced and processed coal than for sales of purchased coal that we do not process prior to resale 
we are the surviving corporation of the merger between old alpha and foundation 
prior to the merger  old alpha  together with its affiliates  was a leading supplier of high quality appalachian coal to the steel industry  electric utilities and other industries  with mining operations in virginia  west virginia  kentucky and pennsylvania 
old alpha was also the nation s largest supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal  a key ingredient in steel manufacturing 
prior to the merger  foundation  together with its affiliates  was a major us coal producer operating mines and associated processing and loading facilities in pennsylvania  west virginia and wyoming 
foundation primarily supplied steam coal to us utilities for use in generating electricity and also sold steam coal to industrial plants and metallurgical coal to steel companies 

table of contents prior to the merger  old alpha had one reportable segment  coal operations 
as a result of the merger  we changed our organizational structure and now have two reportable segments  eastern coal operations and western coal operations 
eastern coal operations consists of our operations in northern and central appalachia  our coal brokerage activities and our road construction business 
western coal operations consists of two powder river basin mines in wyoming 
our all other category includes an idled underground mine in illinois  expenses associated with closed mines  dry systems technologies  coal gas recovery  equipment sales and repair operations  terminal services  the leasing of mineral rights and general corporate overhead 
all prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
on january   old alpha adopted accounting standards codification asc  debt with conversion and other options asc 
asc has been retrospectively applied as of the issuance date of april  for our outstanding convertible senior notes due the convertible notes 
asc requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner reflective of the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
adoption of the standard resulted in the following balance sheet impacts at december  a reduction of debt by million and an increase in paid in capital of million  an increase to deferred loan costs of million  a net reduction to deferred tax assets of million million reduction in deferred tax assets  offset by a million change in the valuation allowance  and a net increase in retained earnings of million 
the deferred loan fees and debt discount are being amortized and accreted  respectively  over the term of the convertible notes  which are due in interest expense of million and million was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to amortization of the deferred loan fees and accretion of the debt discount 
the presentation and disclosure requirements of asc  consolidation  were adopted january   which require a non controlling interest to be included in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component within shareholders equity separate from the parent s equity  and consolidated net income to be reported in the consolidated statements of operations as a consolidated amount and as amounts separately attributable to the parent and non controlling interest 
the presentation requirements have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
business developments in addition to the merger completed on july   recent business developments included the following excelven pty ltd 
during  old alpha recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the total remaining value of our interest in excelven pty ltd 
excelven because it had exhausted all reasonable efforts to obtain a mining permit from the venezuelan government and concluded that it is no longer reasonable to assume that a permit will be granted 
excelven  through its subsidiaries  controls the rights to the las carmelitas mining venture in venezuela 
kingwood mining company  llc 
during  old alpha announced the permanent closure of the whitetail kittanning mine  an adjacent coal preparation plant and other ancillary facilities 
the mine stopped producing coal in early january and kingwood ceased equipment recovery operations in april the decision resulted from adverse geologic conditions and regulatory requirements that rendered the coal seam unmineable at this location 
during  old alpha recorded a charge of million  which includes asset impairment charges of million  write off of advance mining royalties that were deemed unrecoverable of million  severance and other employee benefit costs of million and increased reclamation obligations of million 
the results of operations for kingwood have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
cliffs natural resources  inc proposed merger 
during  old alpha entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which  and subject to the terms and conditions thereof  cliffs natural resources inc formerly known as cleveland cliffs inc 
cliffs would acquire all of its outstanding shares 
on november   old alpha commenced litigation against cliffs by filing an action in the delaware court of chancery to obtain an order requiring cliffs to hold its shareholder meeting as scheduled 
on november   old alpha and cliffs mutually terminated the merger agreement and settled the litigation 
the terms of the settlement agreement included a million payment from cliffs to old alpha which  net of transaction costs  resulted in a gain of million in sale of mineral reserves 
during  old alpha sold approximately million tons of underground coal reserves at its enterprise operations to a private coal producer for approximately million in cash 
old alpha recognized a gain of million from the sale in 
table of contents gallatin materials llc 
during   old alpha sold its interest in gallatin for cash in the amount of million and recorded a gain on the sale of million 
the proceeds were used in part to repay the gallatin loan facility outstanding with nedbank limited in the amount of million 
an escrow balance of million was established and old alpha agreed to indemnify and guarantee the buyer against breaches of representations and warranties in the sale agreement and contingencies that may have existed at closing and materialize within one year from the date of the sale 
as of december   all outstanding obligations had been satisfied and the balance of the escrow account had been released 
the results of operations for gallatin have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
mingo logan acquisition 
during  old alpha completed the acquisition of certain coal mining assets in western west virginia known as mingo logan from arch coal  inc for million 
the mingo logan purchase consisted of coal reserves  one active deep mine and a load out and processing plant  which is managed by our callaway operations 
dominion terminal associates dta 
during  old alpha s subsidiary  alpha terminal company  llc  increased its equity ownership position in dta from approximately to approximately by making an additional investment of million 
dta is a million ton annual capacity coal export terminal located in newport news  virginia 
our coal export and terminal capacity through dta is approximately million tons annually 
common stock and convertible debt offering 
during  old alpha completed concurrent public offerings of  shares of common stock at per share and million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the aggregate net proceeds from the common stock offering and the notes offering were million after commissions and expenses 
old alpha used the net proceeds from the offerings in part to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due  co issued by anr llc and alpha natural resources capital corp 
as a result  old alpha recorded a loss relating to the early extinguishment of debt of million  consisting of million in tender offer consideration and million in write off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs 
the convertible notes are classified as long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets 
in the event the convertible notes become convertible  the outstanding principal amount will be classified as a current liability 
coal pricing trends  uncertainties and outlook our long term outlook for the coal markets in the us remains positive 
the energy information administration eia in its annual energy outlook forecasts that coal fired electrical generation will increase by an average annual growth rate of through in  however  the eia estimates that electric power generation from coal decreased by nearly compared to as overall us demand for electricity declined dramatically and competing fuels became competitively priced 
long term demand for coal and coal based electricity generation in the us will likely be driven by various factors such as the economy  increasing population  increasing demand to power residential electronics and plug in hybrid electric vehicles  public demands for affordable electricity  the inability of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar to become the base load source of electric power  geopolitical risks associated with importing large quantities of global oil and natural gas resources  increasing demand for coal outside the us resulting in increased exports and the relatively abundant steam coal reserves located within the united states 
despite the recent downturn to the us and global economies  the international monetary fund s january world economic outlook forecasts us annual gdp to grow and in and  respectively 
according to the national energy technology laboratory s netl october report on new coal fired power plants  there are  mw of new coal fired electrical generation under construction in the united states and megawatts of new coal fired electrical generation capacity near construction 
this total new capacity will increase the annual coal consumption for electrical generation by an estimated fifty million tons  much of which is expected to be supplied from the powder river basin in wyoming 
additionally  approximately  megawatts of coal fired electrical generation are in the permitting phase and  megawatts of coal fired electrical generation have been announced and are in the early stages of permitting and development 
coal exports from the us decreased from approximately million tons in to approximately million tons in in response to the worldwide economic downturn 
despite the decline in us export coal in  export volumes were similar to levels due to the number of committed tons under contract 
according to the eia s international energy outlook ieo  global primary energy demand will grow by between and  with coal demand rising most in absolute terms and fossil fuels accounting for most of the increase in demand between now and china and india have contributed more than half the increase in global demand for energy  and over for coal  since the ieo estimates these two growing economies will contribute more than of the increase in global energy demand and nearly of the increase in global coal demand through the ieo has reached a general conclusion that dependence on coal for power rises strongly in countries with emerging economies and relatively large coal reserves  while it stagnates in the more developed nations and nations with smaller coal reserves 

table of contents ultimately  the global demand for and use of coal may be limited by any global treaties which place restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions 
as part of the united nations framework convention on climate change  representatives from nations  including the us  met in bali  indonesia in december to discuss a program to limit greenhouse gas emissions after the convention adopted the bali road map that detailed a two year process to finalizing a binding agreement in copenhagen in in december participants gathered in copenhagen to develop a framework for climate change mitigation beyond the principal output of the copenhagen summit was the copenhagen accord  a document that is neither legally binding nor voted upon nor signed  but was simply noted by the participating countries 
although the results from the copenhagen summit were considered modest by many participants  the ultimate outcome of future summits  and any treaty or other arrangement ultimately adopted by the united states or other countries  may have a material adverse impact on the global demand for and supply of coal 
this is particularly true if cost effective technology for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide is not sufficiently developed 
proposed coal fired electric generating facilities that do not include technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide are facing increasing opposition from environmental groups as well as state and local governments who are concerned with global climate change and uncertain financial impacts of potential greenhouse gas regulations 
coal fired generating plants incorporating carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies will be more expensive to build than conventional pulverized coal generating plants and the technologies are still in the developmental stages 
this dynamic may cause power generating companies to cut back on plans to build coal fired plants in the near term 
nevertheless  the desire to attain us energy independence suggests the construction of new coal fired generating facilities is likely to remain a viable option 
this desire  coupled with heightened interest in coal gasification and coal liquefaction  is a potential indicator of increasing demand for coal in the united states 
based on weekly production reporting through december  from the eia  year over year appalachian production had declined by approximately due to decreasing coal demand 
compared to  western coal production had decreased by approximately in in central appalachia  delays with respect to permits to construct valley fills at surface mines are likely to slow the permitting process for surface mining in that region with resultant uncertainties for producers 
average spot market prices for for central appalachian and northern appalachian coals decreased by roughly and  respectively  compared to prices 
average spot market prices for powder river basin coal are down approximately from the previous year  with the basin offering the least expensive fossil fuel on a dollar per btu basis 
long term  the delicate balance of coal supply and increasing coal demand is expected to result in strong  but potentially volatile fundamentals for the us coal industry 
our revenues depend on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
the pricing environment for us steam coal production in has fallen significantly below the high levels seen during however  recent steam coal market conditions indicate that supply and demand have largely come into balance and the forecasted upswing in demand may result in improved prices for suppliers 
prices for high quality metallurgical coal  used to manufacture coke for steelmaking  had deteriorated in in response to decreased worldwide demand for steel 
however  strong global demand for steel  particularly in china and limited metallurgical coal supply  have created market conditions that may signal increasing prices in the worldwide economic slowdown and the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets have had an impact on the demand for and price of coal 
global energy fundamentals  including the relative decline in demand and prices for both natural gas and crude oil have driven spot prices of coal lower in the marketplace 
steel manufacturers had shut in significant capacity in the early part of due to the lack of near term visibility around demand for steel for construction  automobile manufacturing and other down stream products 
steel manufacturers appear to have completed destocking their inventories and steel plant utilization has steadily increased since the early part of  which may signal strengthening demand for metallurgical coal in the relatively low price of natural gas is creating further competitive pressure on the demand for steam coal 
a weak economic recovery could slacken demand for metallurgical and steam coals and could negatively influence pricing in the near term 
longer term  coal industry fundamentals remain intact 
coal has been the fastest growing fossil fuel for six consecutive years  and significant additional growth is expected worldwide 
seaborne coal has grown to nearly billion tons annually  and us exports will be needed to meet worldwide demand 
in addition  the idling of coal mines due to weakened market conditions  and the resulting decrease in production  particularly in central appalachia  should better match production to demand 
these factors should lead to a tighter market for coal  both globally and in the united states  in the coming years 
our results of operations are dependent upon the prices we obtain for our coal as well as our ability to improve productivity and control costs 
principal goods and services include maintenance and repair parts and services  electricity  fuel  roof control and support items  explosives  tires  conveyance structure  ventilation supplies and lubricants 
our management continues to aggressively control costs and strives to improve operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures 
as is common in the current economic environment  we are experiencing volatility in operating costs related to fuel  explosives  steel  tires  contract services and healthcare and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs at all operations 
we have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration  for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods  and to support the business units 
the supplier base has been relatively stable for many years  but there has been some consolidation 
we are not dependent on any one supplier in any region 
we promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on lowering our costs 
we seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise 
to the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases  or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties  our operating margins would be negatively impacted 
employee labor costs have historically increased primarily due to the demands associated with attracting and retaining a workforce  however  recent stability in the marketplace has helped ease this situation 
we may also continue to experience difficult geologic conditions  delays in obtaining permits  labor shortages  unforeseen equipment problems and shortages of critical materials such as tires and explosives that may result in adverse cost increases and limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels

income tax expense benefit 
income tax benefit from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million as compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the income tax benefit for was due primarily to the tax benefits associated with percentage depletion and the reversal of million of valuation allowance that was triggered by our movement from a net deferred tax asset position to a net deferred tax liability position on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of the merger  partially offset by non deductible transaction costs and the impact from the interest rate swap 

table of contents our effective tax rate of for was lower than the statutory federal tax rate due primarily to the tax benefits associated with percentage depletion  the domestic production activities deduction  and the change in the valuation allowance  partially offset by state income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was lower than the effective tax rate for mainly due to the benefits of the valuation allowance reversal and percentage depletion being larger in relation to pre tax income 
as a result of the merger  a significant amount of the book depreciation  depletion and amortization expense does not impact the percentage depletion calculation 
due to being in a net liability position  no valuation allowances were established against the minimum tax credit carryforwards and the federal net operating loss  much of which is created from the percentage depletion deduction

segment analysis the price of coal is influenced by many factors that vary by region 
such factors include  but are not limited to coal quality  which includes energy heat content  sulfur  ash  volatile matter and moisture content  transportation costs  regional supply and demand  available competitive fuel sources such as natural gas  nuclear or hydro  and production costs  which vary by mine type  available technology and equipment utilization  productivity  geological conditions  and mine operating expenses 
the energy content or heat value of coal is a significant factor influencing coal prices as higher energy coal is more desirable to consumers and typically commands a higher price in the market 
the heat value of coal is commonly measured in british thermal units or the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree fahrenheit 
coal from the eastern and midwest regions of the united states tends to have a higher heat value than coal found in the western united states 
powder river basin coal  with its lower energy content  lower production cost and often greater distance to travel to the consumer  typically sells at a lower price than northern and central appalachian coal that has a higher energy content and is often located closer to the end user

ebitda  a measure used by management to evaluate its ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes  is defined as net income loss from operations plus interest expense  income tax expense  amortization of acquired coal supply agreements and depreciation  depletion and amortization  less interest income and income tax benefit 
ebitda is not a financial measure recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
the amounts shown for ebitda as presented may differ from amounts calculated and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
certain non cash items that may adjust ebitda in the compliance calculation are a accretion on asset retirement obligations  b amortization of intangibles  c any long term incentive plan accruals or any non cash compensation expense realized from grants of stock appreciation or similar rights  stock options or other rights to officers  directors and employees  and d gains or losses associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments 
certain non recurring items that may adjust ebitda in the compliance calculation are a business optimization expenses or other restructuring charges  b non cash impairment charges  c certain non cash expenses or charges arising as a result of the application of acquisition accounting  d non cash charges associated with loss on early extinguishment of debt  and e charges associated with litigation  arbitration  or contract settlements 
certain other items that may adjust ebitda in the compliance calculation are a after tax gains or losses from discontinued operations  b franchise taxes  and c other non cash expenses that do not represent an accrual or reserve for future cash expense 

table of contents the alpha credit facility requires us to use pro forma results for the calculation of adjusted ebitda representative of a four quarter rolling total 
the pro forma four quarter rolling ebitda total is comprised of the historical results of old alpha  adjusted for the pro forma ebitda results of foundation calculated in accordance with the alpha credit facility for the quarters ended march  and june   plus ebitda of alpha for the quarters ended september  and december  pro forma ebitda is then adjusted for the items described above based on the same pro forma methodology for ebitda to derive adjusted ebitda 
the calculation of adjusted ebitda shown below is based on our pro forma results of operations in accordance with the alpha credit facility and therefore  is different from ebitda presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k

cash interest for the twelve months ended december  has been calculated from the results of old alpha  adjusted for the pro forma results of foundation  for the quarters ended march  and june   and the results of alpha for the quarters ended september  and december  cash interest for the twelve months ended december  is calculated as follows in thousands interest expense pro forma foundation interest expense less interest income less pro forma foundation interest income less non cash interest expense less pro forma foundation non cash interest expense pro forma net cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the new alpha credit facility if certain circumstances exist where all of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes were converted at the option of the holders  we believe we would have adequate liquidity to satisfy the obligations for the convertible notes and remain in compliance with any required covenants 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  the underlying obligations that they secure  such as asset retirement obligations  self insured workers compensation liabilities  royalty obligations and certain retiree medical obligations  are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post mining reclamation required by our mining permits  pay our federal production royalties  pay workers compensation claims under self insured workers compensation laws in various states  pay federal black lung benefits  pay retiree health care benefits to certain retired umwa employees and perform certain other obligations 
in order to provide the required financial assurance  we generally use surety bonds for post mining reclamation and bank letters of credit for self insured workers compensation obligations and umwa retiree health care obligations 
federal black lung benefits are paid from a dedicated trust fund to which future contributions will be required 
bank letters of credit are also used to collateralize a portion of the surety bonds 
we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of million as of december  to secure various obligations and commitments 
in addition  we had million of letters of credit in place  of which million was outstanding under the alpha credit facility  and million was outstanding under our a r facility 
these outstanding letters of credit served as collateral for workers compensation bonds  reclamation surety bonds  secured umwa retiree health care obligations  and other miscellaneous obligations 
in the event that additional surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets and interests in coal mining companies  and acquisitions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements 
these bids or proposals  which may be binding or nonbinding  are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total long term debt equipment purchase commitments operating leases minimum royalties federal coal lease coal purchase commitments coal contract buyout total long term debt includes principal amounts due in the years shown 
cash interest payable on these obligations  with interest rates ranging between and on our loans  would be approximately million in  million in to  million in to  and million after 
table of contents additionally  we have long term liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations  postretirement  pension  workers compensation and black lung benefits 
the table below reflects the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these obligations in thousands after total asset retirement obligation postretirement pension workers compensation benefits and black lung benefits total critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions  including the current economic environment that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances require 
illiquid credit markets  volatile equity  foreign currency  and energy markets and declines in demand for steel products due to the current economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods 
derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
we are subject to the risk of price volatility for certain of the materials and supplies used in production  such as diesel fuel and explosives 
as a part of our risk management strategy  we enter into pay fixed  receive variable swap agreements with financial institutions to mitigate the risk of price volatility for both diesel fuel and explosives 
swap agreements are derivative instruments that we are required to recognize as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting requirements for derivatives are complex and judgment is required in certain areas such as cash flow hedge accounting and hedge effectiveness testing 
we assess each swap agreement to determine whether or not it qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting 
in performing the assessment  we make estimates and assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows related to the forecasted purchases of diesel fuel and explosives 
we update our assessments at least on a quarterly basis 
reclamation 
our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at deep mines 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates  and assumptions regarding productivity 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based upon third party costs 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
our asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value  or the amount at which obligations could be settled in a current transaction between willing third parties 
in order to determine fair value  we must also estimate a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed further below discount rate 
asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value 
we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives  adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin 
the measurement of an obligation is based upon the amount a third party would demand to assume the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities 
this margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities 
the inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is completed 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately million 

table of contents coal reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists and reviewed by a third party consultant 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures  as well as the valuation of coal reserves and depletion rates 
at december   we had  million tons of proven and probable coal reserves assigned to our active operations 
postretirement medical benefits 
we have long term liabilities for postretirement medical benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future health care cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefit costs 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefits other than pensions was for foundation and for legacy alpha for the year ended december  at december   we had total postretirement medical benefit obligations of million 
one percentage one percentage health care cost trend rate point increase point decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on a accumulated postretirement benefit obligation one half one half percentage point percentage point discount rate increase decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on a accumulated postretirement benefit obligation retirement plans 
we assumed two non contributory defined benefit retirement plans from the merger covering certain of our salaried and non union hourly employees 
we also have an unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan covering certain eligible employees 
benefits are based on either the employee s compensation prior to retirement or stated amounts for each year of service with us 
funding of the defined benefit retirement plans is in accordance with the requirements of erisa  which can be deducted for federal income tax purposes 
we contributed million to our defined benefit retirement plans for the five months ended december  for the five months ended december   we recorded pension expense of million 

table of contents the calculation of the net periodic benefits costs pension expense and projected benefit obligation associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that we deem to be critical accounting estimates 
these assumptions are used by our independent actuaries to make the underlying calculations 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption of the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
we establish the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets 
the pension plan s investment targets are equity private equity  fixed income  other and real estate mutual funds 
investments are rebalanced on a periodic basis to stay within these targeted guidelines 
the long term rate of return assumption used to determine periodic pension expense was for the five months ended december  any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and amortized into expense in future periods 
the discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected  accumulated and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension cost 
in estimating that rate  we use rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was for the five months ended december  the differences resulting from actual versus assumed discount rates are amortized into pension expense over the remaining average service life of the active plan participants 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the net periodic pension cost for the five months ended december  by less than million and decrease the projected benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million 
the corresponding effects of a one half of one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be less than a million increase in the net periodic pension cost and approximately a million increase in the projected benefit obligation 
workers compensation 
workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment 
our operations are covered through a combination of a self insurance program and insurance policies 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarial studies 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
at december   we had workers compensation obligations of million 
coal workers pneumoconiosis 
we are required by federal and state statutes to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
old alpha subsidiaries are insured for workers compensation and black lung obligations by a third party insurance provider in all locations with the exception of west virginia  where certain old alpha subsidiaries are self insured for workers compensation and state black lung obligations 
due to the merger  the company assumed the workers compensation and black lung obligations of the foundation subsidiaries the foundation subsidiaries 
the foundation subsidiaries acquired in the merger are self insured for black lung benefits and fund benefit payments through a section c tax exempt trust fund 
provisions are made for estimated benefits based on annual evaluations prepared by independent actuaries 
the foundation subsidiaries are also self insured for worker s compensation benefits with the exception of wyoming where the company participates in a compulsory state run fund 
charges are made to operations for self insured black lung claims  as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee s applicable term of service 
as of december   we had black lung obligations of million  which are net of assets of million that are held in a tax exempt trust fund 
business combinations 
we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment  and the utilization of independent valuation experts  and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  market prices and asset lives  among other items 

table of contents income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we analyze both positive and negative evidence 
such evidence includes objective evidence obtained from our historical earnings  future sales commitments  outlooks on the coal industry by us and third parties  expected level of future earnings with sensitivities on expectations considered  timing of temporary difference reversals  ability or inability to meet forecasted earnings  unsettled industry circumstances  ability to carry back and utilize a future tax loss if a loss were to occur  available tax planning strategies  limitations on deductibility of temporary differences  and the impact the alternative minimum tax has on utilization of deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is monitored and reviewed quarterly 
if our conclusions change in the future regarding the realization of a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made  which may have a material impact on our results 
as of december   we were in a net deferred tax liability position with tax computed at regular tax rates on the gross temporary differences 
federal tax attributes related to minimum tax credit carry forwards and federal and state net operating losses offset the tax effect of the temporary differences somewhat 
a valuation allowance of million has been provided on certain state net operating losses not expected to provide future tax benefits 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we estimate the fair value of goodwill using a number of factors  including the application of multiples and discounted cash flow estimates 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of august of each year 
we test consolidated goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level 
we perform our goodwill impairment test in two steps 
step one compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if step one indicates that an impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of our step one analysis  our estimate of fair value for each reporting unit is based on discounted cash flows the income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of each reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including markets  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  capital spending  working capital changes and the discount rate 
the discount rate is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows and reflects the rate of return required by an investor in the current economic conditions 
goodwill was million as of december  and of that amount  million was acquired on july  in connection with the merger note 
due to the short period of time between the merger and the annual impairment testing date and the absence of any impairment indicators between the date of acquisition and august  related to the goodwill acquired  the company did not test the newly acquired goodwill for impairment 
the company s annual goodwill impairment review performed on august  for the remaining million supported its carrying value 
new accounting pronouncements issued and not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which modifies how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the guidance clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the guidance requires an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
it also requires additional disclosures about a company s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
the guidance is applicable for annual periods beginning after november  january  for the company 
the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  the guidance will have on its results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of long term coal supply agreements 
as of february   we had sales commitments for approximately of planned shipments for uncommitted and unpriced tonnage was  and for  and  respectively 
the discussion below presents the sensitivity of the market value of selected financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
the range of changes reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
we have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel  steel and other items such as explosives 
we manage our risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivative instruments from time to time  primarily swap contracts with financial institutions  for a certain percentage of our monthly requirements 
swap agreements essentially fix the price paid for our diesel fuel and explosives by requiring us to pay a fixed price and receive a floating price 
we expect to use approximately  tons of explosives in through our derivative swap contracts  we have fixed prices for approximately of our expected explosive needs  respectively 
if the price of natural gas were to decrease in  our expense resulting from our natural gas derivatives would increase  which would be largely offset by a decrease in the cost of our physical explosive purchases 
we expect to use approximately  gallons and  gallons of diesel fuel in and  respectively 
through our derivative swap contracts  we have fixed prices for approximately and of our expected diesel fuel needs for and  respectively 
if the price of diesel fuel were to decrease in  our expense resulting from our diesel fuel derivative swap contracts would increase  which would be offset by a decrease in the cost of our physical diesel fuel purchases 
credit risk our credit risk is primarily with electric power generators and steel producers 
our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor outstanding accounts receivable against established credit limits 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated 
these steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral  requiring prepayments for shipments or establishing customer trust accounts held for our benefit in the event of a failure to pay 
interest rate risk our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
as we continue to monitor the interest rate environment in concert with our risk mitigation objectives  consideration is being given to future interest rate risk reduction strategies 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates through our alpha credit facility  which has a variable interest rate of percentage points over the london interbank offered rate libor  subject  in the case of the revolving credit line  to adjustment based on leverage ratios 
as of december   our term loan due under the alpha credit facility had an outstanding balance of million  net of debt discount of million 
the current portion of the term loan due in the next twelve months was million 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our interest expense by million  which is partially offset by our interest rate swap 
to achieve risk mitigation objectives  we have in the past managed our interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  effective may  we entered into an interest rate swap to reduce the risk that changing interest rates could have on our operations 
the swap initially qualified for cash flow hedge accounting and changes in fair value were recorded as a component of equity  however  the debt instrument was subsequently paid and the swap no longer qualified for cash flow hedge accounting 
the amounts that were previously recorded in equity of million were recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in subsequent changes in fair value of the interest rate swap will be recorded in earnings 
if interest rates were to decrease in  our expense resulting from our interest rate swap would increase  which would be partially offset by a decrease in the amount of actual interest paid on our alpha credit facility
