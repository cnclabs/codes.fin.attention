item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements in this annual report on form k  including  without limitation  statements regarding the following matters are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our business strategy  our plans for future operations  industry conditions  our expectations about earnings per share and segment operating results  and the factors underlying those expectations  including our expectations about demand for our deepwater oilfield services and products as a result of the factors we specify in the overview below  projections relating to subsea tree orders  the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives  our projected capital expenditures for  the adequacy of our accruals for uninsured expected liabilities from workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and general liability claims  our expectation that our total unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly increase or decrease in the next months  our expectations about the cash flows from our investment in medusa spar llc  and the factors underlying those expectations  our expectations regarding operating income for each of our segments and the factors underlying those expectations  our backlog  and our expectations regarding the effect of inflation in the near future 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including those we refer to under the headings risk factors and cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in part i of this report 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process  as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate  we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct 
accordingly  evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward looking information 
overview the table that follows sets out our revenue and profitability for  and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income net income during  we generated approximately of our revenue  and of our operating income  from our services and products provided to the oil and gas industry 
in  our revenue decreased by  with the largest decreases in our subsea products and inspection segments 
our subsea products segment revenue decreased primarily from lower umbilical plant throughput 
our inspection segment revenue decreased from lower demand for those services and the impact of a stronger us dollar against the u 
k pound sterling 
our rov segment revenue increased  as a result of a growth in days on hire for our larger work class fleet 
the million consolidated net income we earned in was the second highest in our history 
the million decrease from net income was attributable to a lower profit contribution from our subsea products segment  which had million less operating income on million less revenue 
the lower revenue and operating income was primarily in our umbilical operations 
page 
table of contents in  we invested in the following major capital projects additions of work class rovs  including new vehicles placed into service during the year  expenditures to build our own facility to produce control umbilicals for our rovs  and expansion of our specialty products business in foreign markets 
for  the international energy agency forecasts a global surplus supply of oil due to a reduction in demand stemming from the global economic recession 
we therefore anticipate some deepwater construction projects will continue to be delayed until there is a meaningful recovery in hydrocarbon demand 
we believe  however  that deepwater drilling activity will continue growing in  as floating rigs currently under construction are added to the worldwide fleet 
we believe the trend for our customers to increasingly invest in deepwater projects will continue 
our belief is based on the length of time needed to plan and execute deepwater projects  and the long term outlook for oil and gas supply  which includes limited non opec supply growth  rapid reservoir depletion rates and eventually increasing hydrocarbon demand 
we expect our diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to  as compared to in  with an increase in operating income in our rov and subsea products segments and decreases in our subsea projects and mops segments 
we anticipate rov operating income to increase in as a result of a higher average fleet size and our subsea products operating income to increase from higher revenue  manufacturing efficiencies and better job execution 
we use our rovs in the offshore oil and gas industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks  including drill support  installation and construction support  pipeline inspection and surveys and subsea production facility inspection  repair and maintenance 
the largest percentage of our rovs has historically been used to provide drill support services 
therefore  the number of floating drilling rigs on hire is a leading market indicator for this business 
the following table shows average floating rigs on hire and our rov utilization 
average number of floating rigs rov days on hire in thousands rov utilization demand for floating rigs is our primary driver of future growth prospects 
according to industry data published by ods petrodata  at the end of  there were floating drilling rigs in the world  with of the rigs under contract and of the rigs contracted through seventy four additional floating rigs were on order and scheduled to be delivered through  and of these have been contracted long term  for an average term of approximately seven years 
we estimate to floating rigs will be placed in service during  and we have rov contracts on of those to supply rovs 
competitors have the rov contracts on six rigs  leaving seven to contract opportunities  and we are pursuing all of those 
in addition to floating rig demand  subsea tree completions are another leading indicator of the strength of the deepwater market and the primary demand driver for our subsea products lines 
according to industry data published by quest offshore resources  inc  there were less than subsea completions before  approximately  in the decade of the s  approximately  in the decade of the s  and quest forecasts over  for the decade of the s 
additionally  the projected global market for subsea tree orders is expected to increase in the time period compared to the previous five years 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require us to make various estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods we present 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue according to the type of contract involved 
on a daily basis  we recognize revenue under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 
page 
table of contents we account for significant fixed price contracts  which we enter into mainly in our subsea products segment  and occasionally in our subsea projects and advanced technologies segments  using the percentage of completion method 
in  we accounted for of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we consider whether the customer provides specifications for the construction of facilities or production of goods or for the provision of related services  we can reasonably estimate our progress towards completion and our costs  the contract includes provisions as to the enforceable rights regarding the goods or services to be provided  consideration to be received and the manner and terms of payment  the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  and we can be expected to perform our contractual obligations 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it 
in prior years  we have recorded adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates 
although we are continually striving to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs could be significant in future periods 
we recognize the remainder of our revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
we base these evaluations on a comparison of the assets carrying values to forecasts of undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets or quoted market prices 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
our expectations regarding future sales and undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective  cover extended periods of time and depend on a number of factors outside our control  such as changes in general economic conditions  laws and regulations 
accordingly  these expectations could differ significantly from year to year 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce our investment in the ocean pensador  an oil tanker we were holding for possible conversion  to its fair value 
in we sold that asset at a further loss of million 
we charge the costs of repair and maintenance of property and equipment to operations as incurred  while we capitalize the costs of improvements 
goodwill 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  with the purchase price being allocated to the net assets acquired based on their fair market values at the date of acquisition 
we test the goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units for impairment annually  or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
except for rovs and inspection  which are tested as single reporting units  our operating units are one level below our business segments 
we estimate fair value of the reporting units using both an income approach  which considers a discounted cash flow model  and a market approach 
reductions in estimates of our future cash flows or adverse changes in market comparable information may result in goodwill impairments in the future 
for reporting units with significant goodwill  we do not believe our goodwill will be impaired during loss contingencies 
we self insure for workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and comprehensive general liability claims to levels we consider financially prudent and carry insurance for exposures beyond the self insurance levels  which can be by occurrence or in the aggregate 
we determine the level of accruals by reviewing our historical experience and current year claim activity 
we do not record accruals on a present value basis 
we review larger claims with insurance adjusters and establish specific reserves for known liabilities 
we establish an additional reserve for incidents incurred but not reported to us for each year using our estimates and based on prior experience 
we believe we have established adequate accruals for uninsured expected liabilities arising from those obligations 
however  it is possible that future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates relating to these matters 
we are involved in various claims and actions against us  most of which are covered by insurance 
we believe that our ultimate liability  if any  that may result from these claims and actions will not materially affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
page 
table of contents income taxes 
we account for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes on our financial statements 
we charged million to income tax expense in for penalties and interest for uncertain tax positions  which brought our total liabilities for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions to million on our balance sheet at december  including associated foreign tax credits and penalties and interest  we have accrued a net total of million in the caption other long term liabilities on our balance sheet for unrecognized tax benefits 
all additions or reductions to those liabilities affect our effective income tax rate in the periods of change 
we do not believe that the total of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next months 
our tax provisions are based on our expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
we are at risk that a taxing authority s final determination of our tax liabilities may differ from our interpretation 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions  the amount of pre tax income fluctuates and our estimates regarding the realizability of items such as foreign tax credits may change 
in  and  we recorded reductions of income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions related to certain tax liabilities we recorded in prior years 
current income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  while the net deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our balance sheet 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
we currently have no valuation allowances 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these adjustments to the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded 
for a summary of our major accounting policies and a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
additionally  we had million available under our revolving credit facility  which currently extends to january we had total borrowings of million at december   with total maturities in of million 
maturities in are not classified as current as of december   since we are able and have the intent to extend the stated maturities by borrowing amounts equal to the maturities under the revolving credit facility  with a maturity date after one year 
at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures  including business acquisitions  for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
for  we plan to invest to support growth of our rov fleet to meet firm demand and we plan to add a new diving support vessel as a replacement for another vessel 
capital expenditures in included expenditures for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet  the construction of our own facility to produce control umbilicals for our rovs  and expansion of our specialty subsea products business in foreign markets 
capital expenditures in included expenditures for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet  the purchase of gto for million  vessel upgrades  and facility expansions for our specialty subsea products 
capital expenditures in included expenditures for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet  the purchase of norway based ifokus engineering as ifokus  a designer and manufacturer of specialty subsea products  for million  vessel upgrades  the acquisition of a small inspection company in the united kingdom  and facility expansions in the united kingdom  norway  morgan city  la and houston 
our facility expansions in the united kingdom  norway and houston during related to our subsea products manufacturing operations  and our morgan city expansion supports our rov and subsea projects operations 
our capital expenditures during  and included million  million and million  respectively  in our rov segment  principally for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet to expand the fleet and replace units we retired and for facilities infrastructure to support our growing rov fleet size 
we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities as they arise 
we added  and rovs to our fleet and disposed of nine  four and seven units during  and  respectively  resulting in a total of work class systems in the fleet at december  page 
table of contents in  we chartered a larger deepwater vessel  the ocean intervention iii  for three years  with extension options for up to six additional years 
the initial three year term of the charter began in may we also chartered an additional larger deepwater vessel  the olympic intervention iv  for an initial term of five years  which began in the third quarter of we outfitted each of these larger deepwater vessels with two of our high specification work class rovs  and we expect to utilize these vessels to perform subsea hardware installation and inspection  repair and maintenance projects  and to conduct well intervention services in the ultra deep waters of the us gulf of mexico 
we have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in  we acquired a interest in medusa spar llc 
at formation  medusa spar llc borrowed million  or approximately of its total capitalization  from a group of banks 
the loan was repaid in we expect the majority of the positive net cash flow generated in the future by medusa spar llc will be distributed to the equity holders 
we received million  million and million of cash distributions from medusa spar llc and recognized million  million and million of equity in the earnings of medusa spar llc in  and  respectively 
medusa spar llc is a variable interest entity under accounting rules 
as we are not the primary beneficiary of medusa spar llc  we are accounting for our investment in medusa spar llc using the equity method of accounting 
at december   our investment in medusa spar llc was million 
our principal source of cash from operating activities is our net income  adjusted for the non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and noncash compensation under our restricted stock plans 
our million  million and million of cash provided from operating activities in  and  respectively  were net of increases decreases of million  million and million  respectively  in accounts receivable and increases decreases of million  million and million  respectively  in inventory and other current assets 
the changes in accounts receivable were due to changes in revenue in the fourth quarter of the respective years  in each case as compared to the fourth quarter of the immediately preceding year 
the changes in inventory and other current assets principally related to rov requirements and subsea products raw materials 
the raw materials increases in related to preparations for building goods in our subsea products segment  which experienced revenue increases of and in and  respectively 
the increases in rov inventory related to equipment waiting for assembly into rovs to be placed in service in subsequent years and increases in parts to be used for servicing our growing rov fleet 
in we used million in investing activities  including million on growing and upgrading our rov operations 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million to modernize and add additional units to our rov fleet and million to increase our subsea products capabilities  including our acquisition of gto for million 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million to modernize and add additional units to our rov fleet  million to add capacity to our subsea products facilities  including our acquisition of ifokus for million 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  in cash flow from financing activities as proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
in addition  in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  of tax benefit realized from tax deductions in excess of financial statement expense related to our stock based compensation plans 
for a description of our incentive plans  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  our board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to a million aggregate purchase price limitation 
during  we completed the authorized repurchases under the plan by repurchasing  shares at a total cost of million  which is reflected in our cash used in financing activities 
under our stock repurchase plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock from through at a total cost of million 
through december   we had reissued all but  of these shares  primarily in connection with stock based compensation plans 
in february  our board of directors approved a new plan to repurchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock 
the timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by our management 
we expect that any shares repurchased under the new plan will be held as treasury stock for future use 
the new plan does not obligate us to repurchase any particular number of shares 
because of our significant foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risks 
we generally minimize these risks primarily through matching  to the extent possible  revenue and expense in the various currencies in which we operate 
cumulative translation adjustments as of december  relate primarily to our net investments in  including long term loans to  our foreign subsidiaries 
a stronger us dollar against the us pound sterling and the norwegian kroner would result in lower operating income 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation has not had a material effect on our revenue or income from operations in the past three years  and no such effect is expected in the near future

table of contents in response to continued increasing demand to support deepwater drilling and identified future construction and production maintenance work  we continue to build new rovs 
these new vehicles are designed for use around the world in water depths of  feet or more 
we added  and rovs in  and  respectively  while disposing of units over the three year period 
we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities 
for  our rov revenue increased over from the growth in days on hire for our larger work class fleet  as our revenue per day on hire decreased approximately 
our operating margin percentage increased as a result of cost controls 
for  our rov revenue increased over from improvements in average revenue per day on hire and growth in days on hire 
we grew our rov fleet size to at december  from at december  and at december  operating income increased by in over and in over we anticipate rov operating income to increase in as a result of an increase in days on hire 
in addition to having a full year of service from the units we added during  we expect to add approximately to rovs in and retire four to six rovs 
our operating margin percentage may decline slightly in due to a change in geographic mix 
our subsea products revenue for declined from from decreased demand for our specialty subsea products and lower umbilical plant throughput 
in  our operating margin percentage decreased from to due to the same factors 
our operating income and margins were also adversely affected by million of unexpected costs we incurred in the third quarter of on two blowout preventer bop control systems that we expect to deliver in our subsea products revenue for rose over on increased sales of our specialty subsea products and umbilicals 
in  our operating margin percentage decreased from to due to engineering and manufacturing cost overruns related to two bop control systems we delivered in and slightly lower margins on several of our other specialty product lines 
we anticipate our subsea products segment operating income in to be higher than  as we expect to benefit from manufacturing improvements and cost reductions we implemented in  avoid repetition of the unexpected costs we incurred in in manufacturing the bop control systems  increase throughput in our umbilical plants and have higher rov tooling rentals and subsea field development hardware sales 
our subsea products backlog was million at december   more than our million backlog at december  our subsea projects revenue and operating income declined from due to a softer market for our diving and shallow water vessel services and competitive pressure in our deepwater vessel market due to an increase in vessel availability 
our subsea projects operating income declined million from on relatively flat revenue due to a softer market for our diving and shallow water vessel services  principally as a result of the substantial completion of work associated with damage caused by hurricanes in and  costs incurred to mobilize the olympic intervention iv to the us gulf of mexico and complete its preparation for service  and expenses we incurred associated with regulatory inspection of four of our vessels 
the amount included a million gain from the sale of an rov support vessel 
the revenue shortage from the factors mentioned above was partially offset by additional revenue from a full year of availability from the ocean intervention iii and the fourth quarter utilization of the olympic intervention iv 
we anticipate our operating income for subsea projects to be less than in  as we complete the performer contract off angola early in and foresee a softer market for our deepwater vessels in the us gulf of mexico 
we also expect a continued decline in demand for our diving and shallow water vessel services and higher vessel drydock expenses 
our inspection segment operating income decreased in compared to due to a lower exchange rate for the uk pound sterling against the us dollar and decreased demand for our services 
in as compared to  our inspection revenue and margins increased  due to strong growth in all of the geographic areas we serve 
we continued to sell more value added services at improved pricing 
we expect that our inspection segment operating income will be relatively flat in the two mobile offshore production systems operating units we owned at the start of continued to work under the same contracts during the year 
in december we sold one of them  the ocean producer  at a gain of million 
in june we sold ocean pensador  an oil tanker we were holding for possible conversion  at a loss of million 
we had page 
table of contents recorded an impairment charge of million on that vessel in the decreases in margins in compared to were the result of the million impairment charge and the decline in the dayrate of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract 
we anticipate our mobile offshore production systems operating income in will decline from as a result of the retirement and sale of the ocean producer in december we anticipate the ocean legend will continue to work on its current contract for all of advanced technologies 
the table that follows sets out revenue and profitability for this segment 
year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income our advanced technologies segment s revenue and operating income were higher than due to an escalation in work on entertainment industry projects and the award of the nasa constellation space suit contract 
our advanced technologies segment s operating income was lower than due to the completion in of an engineering services contract that had been ongoing for more than five years 
we anticipate our advanced technologies operating income will be approximately the same as unallocated expenses 
our unallocated expenses  ie  those not associated with a specific business segment  within gross margin consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans  including restricted stock and bonuses  as well as other general expenses 
a portion of our restricted stock expense varies with the market price of our common stock

in  we experienced a decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from our investment in medusa spar llc due to lower production throughput at the spar 
in  medusa spar llc s net income was higher due to increased throughput from the original blocks dedicated to be processed at the medusa spar  throughput from third parties and the elimination of interest expense  as medusa spar llc repaid its debt during throughput from the original blocks was higher in than due to less downtime from hurricanes in we expect medusa spar llc revenue will decline in due to normal rates of well decline 
medusa spar llc s revenue could be increased if the operator of the producing wells is able to either start producing from other zones in the existing wells  which are anticipated to have higher flow rates than the currently producing zones  or connect more wells to the spar

we have ordered the specialized steel tubes in advance to meet expected sales commitments 
the diving vessel is being built as a replacement for another vessel 
the winches and rov umbilicals have been ordered for new rovs and for anticipated replacements due to normal wear and tear 
should we decide not to accept delivery of the steel tubes  we would incur cancellation charges of at least of the amount canceled

table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  using historical us dollar accounting  or historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations  we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimate of those changes  which we reflect in the original price  or through price escalation clauses in our contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities 
we believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
we have an interest rate hedge in place on million of floating rate debt under our revolving credit facility for the period august to august the hedge fixes three month libor at until august because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for several of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
a stronger us dollar against the us pound sterling and the norwegian kroner would result in lower operating income 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities as to which the functional currency is the local currency  resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded adjustments of million  million and million to our equity accounts in  and  respectively 
negative adjustments reflect the net impact of the strengthening of the us dollar against various foreign currencies for locations where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
conversely  positive adjustments reflect the effect of a weakening dollar 
we recorded foreign currency transaction gains losses of million  million and million which is included in other income expense  net in our consolidated income statements in  and  respectively  related to our foreign operations
