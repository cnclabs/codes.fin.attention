item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market considerations 

table of contents our investment strategy newcastle s investment strategy focuses predominantly on debt investments secured by real estate 
we do not have specific policies as to the allocation among type of real estate related assets or investment categories since our investment decisions depend on changing market conditions 
instead  we focus on relative value and in depth risk reward analysis 
our focus on relative value means that assets which may be unattractive under particular market conditions may  if priced appropriately to compensate for risks such as projected defaults and prepayments  become attractive relative to other available investments 
we generally utilize a match funded financing strategy  when appropriate and available  and active management as part of our investment strategy 
as discussed in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market conditions  the continued challenging credit and liquidity conditions in the markets have reduced the current values of substantially all of our investments from historical levels  and has resulted in impairments in certain investments

we did not have any reit assets or bank loans that are on negative watch for possible downgrade by any rating agency as of december  credit risk management credit risk refers to the ability of each individual borrower under our loans and securities to make required interest and principal payments on the scheduled due dates 
we strive to reduce credit risk by actively monitoring our asset portfolio and the underlying credit quality of our holdings and  where appropriate  repositioning our investments to upgrade their credit quality and yield 
a significant portion of our investments are financed with collateralized debt obligations  known as cdos 
our cdo financings offer us the structural flexibility to buy and sell certain investments to manage risk and  subject to certain limitations  to optimize returns 
further  while the expected yield on our real estate securities  which comprise a meaningful portion of our assets  is sensitive to the performance of the underlying loans  the first risk of default and loss referred to as a first loss position is borne by the more subordinated securities or other features of the securitization transaction  in the case of commercial mortgage and asset backed securities  and the issuer s underlying equity and subordinated debt  in the case of senior unsecured reit debt securities 
as a result of the continued challenging credit and liquidity conditions in the markets  the value of the subordinated securities has generally been reduced or  in some cases  eliminated  which could leave our securities economically in a first loss position 
we also invest in loans and securities which represent first loss positions  in other words  they do not benefit from credit support although we believe at acquisition they predominantly benefit from underlying collateral value in excess of their carrying amounts 

table of contents our financing and hedging activities we employ leverage as part of our investment strategy we do not have a predetermined target debt to equity ratio as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality of those assets 
as a result of our negative gaap equity  our gaap debt to equity ratio is not a meaningful measure as of december  our general investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors limit total leverage as defined under the governing documents to a maximum to debt to equity ratio 
as of december   our debt to equity ratio as computed under this methodology was approximately to we utilize leverage for the sole purpose of financing our portfolio and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates 
we strive to maintain access to a broad array of capital resources in an effort to insulate our business from potential fluctuations in the availability of capital 
we utilize multiple forms of financing  including collateralized debt obligations cdos  other securitizations  term loans  and trust preferred securities  as well as short term financing in the form of loans and repurchase agreements 
further details regarding the forms of financing that we are currently able to utilize are presented in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under market considerations and liquidity and capital resources 
as discussed therein  the continued challenging credit and liquidity conditions have limited the amount of capital resources available to us and made the terms of capital resources we are able to obtain generally less favorable to us relative to the terms we were able to obtain prior to the onset of challenging conditions 
for example  we are currently contractually restricted from entering into new debt financings subject to margin calls other than to finance up to a specified amount of fnma fhlmc securities 
our manager may elect for us to bear a level of refinancing risk on a short term or longer term basis  such as is the case with investments financed with repurchase agreements  when  based on all of the relevant factors  the manager determines that bearing such risk is advisable or unavoidable 
we attempt to reduce refinancing and interest rate risks through the use of match funded financing structures  when appropriate and available  whereby we seek i to match the maturities of our debt obligations with the maturities of our assets and ii to match the interest rates on our investments with like kind debt ie  floating rate assets are financed with floating rate debt and fixed rate assets are financed with fixed rate debt  directly or through the use of interest rate swaps  caps or other financial instruments  or through a combination of these strategies 
we believe this allows us to reduce the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities prior to the maturities of our assets and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings 
we enter into hedging transactions to protect our positions from interest rate fluctuations and other changes in market conditions 
these transactions predominantly include interest rate swaps  and may include the purchase or sale of interest rate collars  caps or floors  options  mortgage derivatives and other hedging instruments  and may be subject to margin calls 
these instruments may be used to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as our manager determines is in the best interest of our stockholders  given the cost of such hedges and the need to maintain our status as a reit 
our manager elects to have us bear a level of interest rate risk that could otherwise be hedged when our manager believes  based on its analysis  that bearing such risks is advisable or unavoidable 
we engage in hedging for the purpose of protecting against interest rate risk and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates
