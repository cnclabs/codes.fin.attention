item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  and other financial information included herein 
the report of our independent auditors on our consolidated financial statements as of december  expresses an unqualified opinion on such consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph related to substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
overview our vision is to transform the lives of cancer patients with breakthrough medicines 
our mission is to discover  develop and commercialize small molecule drugs to treat cancer in patients with the greatest and most urgent unmet medical need aggressive cancers where current therapies are inadequate 
our goal is to build a fully integrated oncology company focused on novel  molecularly targeted therapies to treat solid tumors and hematologic cancers  as well as the spread of primary tumors to distant sites 
product development and discovery our lead cancer product candidate  ridaforolimus  previously known as deforolimus  is being studied in multiple clinical trials in patients with various types of cancers 
in july  we entered into a global collaboration with merck co  inc  or merck  to jointly develop and commercialize ridaforolimus for use in cancer 
we initiated patient enrollment in our initial phase clinical trial of ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcoma in the third quarter of we completed patient enrollment in this phase clinical trial in the fourth quarter of we expect to obtain the results of the second interim analysis of progression free survival or pfs  the primary endpoint of the trial in the second quarter of and the final analysis of pfs in the second half of  in addition  in and we and merck initiated patient enrollment in phase clinical trials in patients with metastatic breast cancer  metastatic endometrial cancer  metastatic non small cell lung cancer and advanced prostate cancer  and phase clinical trials of ridaforolimus in combination with other agents  all as part of our joint global development plan with merck 
these various trials are ongoing at this time 
our collaboration with merck for the global development and commercialization of ridaforolimus anticipates that we together with merck will conduct a broad based development program in multiple potential indications 
the collaboration agreement provides that each party will fund percent of global development costs  except for certain specific costs to be funded percent by merck 
the collaboration agreement establishes responsibilities for supply of the product for development and commercial purposes  promotion  distribution and sales of the product  governance of the collaboration  termination provisions and other matters 
in addition to cost sharing provisions  the collaboration agreement provided for an up front payment by merck of million  which was paid to us in july  and currently provides up to million in milestone payments based on the successful development of ridaforolimus in multiple potential cancer indications  of which million has been paid to us through december   and up to million in milestone payments based on achievement of specified product sales thresholds 
the upfront payment and milestone payments  when earned by us and paid by merck  are non refundable 
merck has also agreed to provide us with up to million in interest bearing  repayable  development cost advances to cover a portion of our share of global development costs  after we have paid million in global development costs and have obtained regulatory approval to market ridaforolimus from the fda in the united states or similar regulatory authorities in europe or japan 
the collaboration agreement provides that each party will receive percent of the profit from the sales of ridaforolimus in the united states  and merck will pay us tiered double digit royalties on sales of ridaforolimus outside the united states 
although our collaboration agreement with merck for the global development and commercialization of ridaforolimus was structured to provide us with substantial funding for the remaining development of ridaforolimus if the collaboration was successful in meeting specified milestones  in we experienced significant shortfalls in anticipated funding when the expected initiation of certain phase clinical trials and the associated significant milestone payments from merck were delayed 
we are currently engaged in advanced negotiations with merck regarding the terms of a revised collaboration agreement 
although there can be no assurance that we will reach agreement with respect to such revisions on terms acceptable to us  our current expectation is that a revised agreement will be entered into in the second fisc al quarter of if we do not finalize such a revised agreement as currently anticipated  we will seek to raise the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through equity offerings  debt financings and pursuit of other strategic options  and reduce our operating expenses 
our second product candidate  ap  is an investigational pan bcr abl inhibitor for which we initiated a phase clinical trial in the second quarter of in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia  or cml  acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  and other hematologic cancers  which is on going at this time 
pending further analysis of the results of this trial and discussions with regulatory authorities  and subject to available funding  we believe that we will be able to proceed to a registration trial of this product candidate in the second half of in the second quarter of  we designated our third product candidate  ap  an investigational anaplastic lymphoma kinase  or alk  inhibitor  as a development candidate 
we have commenced preclinical testing and investigational new drug  or ind  enabling studies of this product candidate 
in addition to our lead development programs  we have a focused drug discovery program centered on small molecule  molecularly targeted therapies and cell signaling pathways implicated in cancer 
we also have an exclusive license to a family of patents  three in the united states and one in europe  including a pioneering us patent covering methods of treating human disease by regulating nf b cell signaling activity 
additionally  we have developed a proprietary portfolio of cell signaling regulation technologies  our argent technology  to control intracellular processes with small molecules  which may be useful in the development of therapeutic vaccines and gene and cell therapy products and which provide versatile tools for applications in cell biology  functional genomics and drug discovery research 
liquidity and sources and uses of funding as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  deferred revenue of million related to non refundable up front and milestone payments from merck  and total stockholders deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and net losses through at least  and  therefore  we will require substantial additional funding to support our operations both in the short term and longer term 
the company is pursuing various potential sources of additional funding 
we are currently engaged in advanced negotiations with merck regarding the terms of a revised collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus 
although there can be no assurance that the parties will reach agreement with respect to such revisions  we expect that a revised agreement will be entered into in the second quarter of we are also pursuing partnering opportunities with our earlier stage product candidates  ap and ap  which could generate up front and milestone payments as well as funding of on going development costs  and other licensing possibilities with our technologies 
if we are unable to execute a revised collaboration with merck on a timely basis  we will seek to raise funding by issuing common stock or other securities in a private placement or a public offering  or through the issuance of debt  and reduce our operating expenses 
if we are not successful in our efforts to secure additional funding as described above or otherwise reduce spending to conserve our cash resources  our cash and cash equivalents as of december  will not be sufficient to fund our operations beyond the second quarter of  and thus there is substantial uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern through our operating losses are primarily due to the costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  personnel and intellectual property protection and enforcement 
as our product development programs progress  we incur significant costs for toxicology and pharmacology studies  product development  manufacturing  clinical trials and regulatory support 
we also incur costs related to planning for potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of products  including market research and assessment 
these costs can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of product candidates in development  the stage of development of each product candidate  the number of patients enrolled in and complexity of clinical trials and other factors 
costs associated with ou r intellectual property include legal fees and other costs to prosecute  maintain  protect and enforce our intellectual property  which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the status of patent issues being pursued  including our on going patent litigation 
historically  we have relied primarily on the capital markets as our source of funding 
we may also obtain funding from collaborations with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and or medical device companies for development and commercialization of our product candidates  such as our collaboration with merck for the global development and commercialization of ridaforolimus 
these collaborations can take the form of licensing arrangements  co development or joint venture arrangements or other structures 
in addition  we utilize long term debt and leases to supplement our funding  particularly as a means of funding investment in property and equipment and infrastructure needs 
if funding from these various sources is unavailable on reasonable terms  we may be required to reduce our operations in order to conserve cash and capital by delaying  scaling back or eliminating one or more of our product development programs or enter into licenses or other arrangements with third parties on terms that may be unfavorable to us 
please see additional information under the caption liquidity and capital resources below 
each of our potential sources of funding is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  and there is no assurance that such funding will become available in  or at all  as discussed further in the risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of revenue recognition  the carrying value of intangible assets  stock based compensation and the fair value of warrants to purchase our common stock 
revenue recognition for the year ended december   we reported license and collaboration revenue of million 
license and collaboration revenue is recorded based on up front payments  periodic license payments and milestone payments received or deemed probable of receipt  spread over the estimated performance period of the license or collaboration agreement 
regarding our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus  as of december   we have received an up front payment of million and milestone payments of million related to the start of phase and phase clinical trials of ridaforolimus 
we are recognizing revenues related to such payments on a straight line basis through  the estimated patent life of the underlying technology 
changes in es timated performance periods  including changes in patent lives of underlying technology  could impact the rate of revenue recognition in any period 
such changes in revenue could have a material impact on our statement of operations 
intangible assets at december   we reported million of intangible assets  consisting of capitalized costs related primarily to purchased and issued patents  patent applications and licenses and the recorded value of the technology associated with our acquisition in september of the percent minority interest of ariad gene therapeutics  inc that we did not previously own  net of accumulated amortization 
the carrying value of these intangible assets is evaluated for possible impairment  and losses are recorded when the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable 
this analysis involves estimates of future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
such estimates require judgment regarding future events and probabilities 
changes in these estimates  including decisio ns to discontinue using the technologies  could result in material changes to our balance sheet and statements of operations 
if we were to abandon the ongoing development of the underlying product candidates or technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
the net book value as of december  of intangible assets related to our nf b technology is  if the patentability of our nf b patents  one of which is currently the subject of litigation and reexamination proceedings  is successfully challenged and such patents are subsequently narrowed  invalidated or circumvented  we may be required to write off some or all of the net book value related to such technology 
stock based compensation in determining expense related to stock based compensation  we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees  consultants and directors 
application of the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of factors such as the market value and volatility of our common stock  a risk free discount rate and an estimate of the life of the option contract 
fluctuations in these factors can result in adjustments to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the volatility of our common stock  or the expected life of stock options granted during the year ended december  were higher or lower than used in the valuation of such stock options  our valuation of  and total stock based compensation expense to be recognized for  such awards would have increased or decreased by up to  or  respectively 
fair value of warrants warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  issued on february  in connection with a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock  are classified as a derivative liability 
accordingly  the fair value of the warrants is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability  and such fair value is adjusted at each financial reporting date with the adjustment to fair value reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option valuation model 
fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model would result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
if  for example  the volatility of our common stock at december  were higher or lower than used in the valuation of such warrants  our valuation of the warrants would have increased or decreased by up to  with such difference reflected in our statement of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recognized license and collaboration revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in license and collaboration revenue was due primarily to an increase in the revenue recognized from the merck collaboration  based on the non refundable up front and milestone payments  totaling million  paid by merck through december   including million in milestone payments paid by merck during the year ended december   in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we expect that license and collaboration revenue that we recognize will increase in reflecting the full year impact of milestone payments received during operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in the research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
current requirements include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the us food and drug administration  or fda  in an investigational new drug application  or ind or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application  or nda or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities  including in some countries approval of product pricing  we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
we group our research and development  or r d  expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture product candidates  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by product candidate 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to lease  operate and maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery rese arch efforts 
these costs have not been tracked by product candidate because the number of product candidates and projects in r d may vary from time to time and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 
direct external expenses are further categorized as costs for clinical programs and costs for preclinical programs 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can begin 
product candidates are designated as clinical programs once we have filed an ind with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 
our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses in  our clinical programs consisted of our lead product candidate ridaforolimus  for which we initiated clinical development in  and ap  for which we initiated clinical development in the direct external expenses for ridaforolimus reflect our share of such expenses  including our share of merck s costs  pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement of our collaboration with merck 
direct external expenses for ridaforolimus were million in  an increase of million  as compared to  primarily reflecting our share of increases in clinical trial costs million and manufacturing costs million and our share of costs for merck s services million 
clinical trial costs and contract manufacturing costs increased due primarily to increasing enrollment in our phase clinical trial of ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcomas and in phase clinical trials of ridaforolimus in patients with breast cancer  endometrial cancer  prostate cancer and non small cell lung cancer 
merck s services provided to the collaboration increased as a result of merck s increasing activities in support of clinical trials and other activities for which merck is r esponsible 
our direct external expenses for ridaforolimus in will depend upon the outcome of our current negotiations with merck regarding the terms of a revised collaboration agreement 
direct external expenses for our second clinical program  ap  were million in  an increase of million as compared to the increase is due primarily to an increase in clinical costs of  and toxicology costs of million 
clinical costs increased due to increasing enrollment in our phase clinical trial in patients with hematologic malignancies 
toxicology costs increased due to the conduct of long term toxicology studies necessary to support development of this product candidate 
subject to sufficient funding  we expect that our direct external expenses for ap will increase in as we expect to initiate additional clinical trials for this product candidate  including a registration trial in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia  pending further analysi s of the results of the phase trial and discussions with regulatory authorities 
the direct external expenses incurred in our preclinical program relate to costs for toxicology studies for our third product candidate  ap we incurred no direct external expenses for preclinical programs in prior to the designation of our third product candidate  all programs other than clinical programs were designated as discovery research and are included in all other r d expenses in the above table 
subject to sufficient funding  we expect that our direct external expenses for our preclinical program  ap  will increase in as we conduct additional pharmacology  toxicology and other studies designed to support the filing of an ind for this product candidate which we expect in all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to the corresponding period in this increase is due to an increase in in personnel expenses of million related to the hiring of additional r d personnel  primarily in our clinical  regulatory and manufacturing areas to support the expanding development of our product candidates  and an increase in overhead and general expenses of million due to increased depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures  offset in part by a decrease in lab supplies and services of  and legal and consulting costs of  due to a focus on cost reduction  and an increase in merck s allocated share of our internal expenses under the terms of the collaboration agreement of million 
all other r d expense s in will depend upon the outcome of our current negotiations with merck regarding the terms of a revised collaboration agreement 
the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or ch anges in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our drug development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our drug development programs will commence are unavailable 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or percent  from million in to million in professional fees decreased by million to million in as compared to million in  due primarily to reduced costs related to corporate and commercial development initiatives  including reduced costs related to the development of systems and processes to support growth  and to our patent infringement litigations against eli lilly and company  or lilly  and amgen inc  or amgen 
general and administrative expenses in will depend upon the outcome of our current negotiations with merck regarding the terms of a revised collaboration agreement 
other income expense interest income expense interest income decreased by percent to  in from million in  as a result of lower interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities and a lower average balance of funds invested in interest expense decreased by percent to  in from  in  due to lower average loan balances and lower interest rates in revaluation of warrant liability the fair value of our warrant liability at december  was million higher than its fair value at its inception in february  resulting in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  the increase in value of the warrant liability is primarily due to the impact of the increase in the market price of our common stock since inception of the warrant 
potential future increases or decreases in our stock price  or other changes in the factors that impact the valuation of the warrant liability  will result in charges or credits  recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
such charges or credits will not have any impact on our cash balances  current liquidity or cash flows from operations 
operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of  or less than percent 
the increase in loss from operations is largely due to the net impact of increases in r d expenses and decreases in general and administrative expenses described above 
we also reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net loss of million or percent  and a net loss per share of and  in and  respectively 
the increase in net loss is largely due to the revaluation of our warrant liability described above 
the decrease in net loss per share is largely due to the increase in the weighted average number of shares of common stoc k outstanding as a result of sales of common stock completed in february and august our results of operations for will vary from those of  and actual losses will depend on a number of factors  including the outcome of our negotiations with merck regarding revisions to the collaboration agreement  the progress of our product development programs  the progress of our discovery research programs  the impact of commercial and business development activities  developments in our legal proceedings  and changes in the valuation of our warrant liability  among other factors 
the extent of such losses will also depend on the sufficiency of funds on hand or available from time to time  which will influence the amount we will spend on operations and capital expenditures as well as the development timelines for our product candidates 
years ended december  and revenue we recognized license and collaboration revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in license and collaboration revenue was due primarily to an increase in the revenue recognized from the merck collaboration  based on the non refundable up front and milestone payments  totaling million  paid by merck through december   in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we entered into this collaboration with merck in july  and thus our statement of operations reflects a full year of revenue recognition in as compared to a partial year in operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in  as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses in  our clinical programs consisted of ridaforolimus and ap prior to  we classified ap as a preclinical program 
direct external expenses for ridaforolimus were million in  an increase of million  as compared to the corresponding period in this increase is due to an increase in clinical trial costs of million  costs of non clinical studies of million and manufacturing costs of million in as compared to  offset in part by an increase in merck s share of expenses of million in in addition  costs for merck s services provided to the collaboration increased by million in as compared to clinical trial costs and contract manufacturing costs increased due primarily to increasing enrollment in our phase clinical trial of ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcomas and initiation of enrollment in in phase clinical trials of ridaforolimus in patients with breast cancer and endometrial cancer 
costs of non clinical studies increased due to the initiation and conduct of toxicology studies of ridaforolimus required to support regulatory filings with the fda 
direct external expenses for our second clinical program  ap  were million in  which consisted primarily of clinical trial costs of  toxicology costs of  and contract manufacturing costs of million as we initiated enrollment in our first phase clinical trial of this product candidate 
we incurred no direct external expenses for preclinical programs in as  during that year  no r d programs were designated as preclinical programs 
all programs other than clinical and preclinical programs are designated as discovery research and are included in all other r d expenses in the above table 
direct external expenses for preclinical programs for the period ended december  relate primarily to costs for toxicology and contract manufacturing studies for ap in support of the filing of the ind for this product candidate in late all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to this increase is due primarily to an increase in personnel expenses of million  related to the hiring of additional r d personnel and related expenses million offset in part by reduced stock based compensation expense  resulting from previous year stock option awards fully vested prior to and forfeitures in  and an increase in overhead expenses of million due to the expiration of a sub lease agreement for a portion of our office and laboratory facility in july  as well as miscellaneous increases in lab supplies and services and professional services 
these variances were offset in part by an increase in merck s allocated share of such expenses under the terms of the collaboration agreem ent of million in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  from million in to million in professional fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in  due primarily to costs related to corporate and commercial development initiatives  including costs related to the development of systems and processes to support growth  and to our patent infringement litigations against lilly and amgen 
personnel and related costs increased by million due to an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments million  offset in part by reduced stock based compensation expense  resulting from previous year stock option awards fully vested prior to and forfeitures in these increases were partially offset by an increase in merck s allocated share of such expenses under the terms of the collaboration agreement 
interest income expense interest income decreased by percent to million in from million in  as a result of lower interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities and a lower average balance of funds invested in interest expense increased by percent to  in from  in  due to higher average loan balances in  as a result of our amendment of our loan agreement in march which  among other things  provided us an additional million in loan proceeds  offset in part by lower interest rates in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million  or percent 
we also reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net loss of million or percent  and a net loss per share of and  in and  respectively 
such increases were due primarily to the net effect of changes in r d expenses and general and administrative expenses noted above 
selected quarterly financial data summarized unaudited quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total license and collaboration revenue net loss net loss per share basic and diluted in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total license and collaboration revenue net loss net loss per share basic and diluted liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments to date primarily through sales of our common stock to institutional investors  collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and  to a lesser extent  through issuances of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt 
we sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
our collaboration with merck for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus  as currently in effect  provides for funding in the form of up front and potential milestone payments  as well as the sharing of development costs for ridaforolimus 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
sources of funds during the years ended december   and  our sources of funds were as follows in thousands sales issuances of common stock in common stock offerings pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from long term borrowings up front payment from merck  included in cash provided by operating activities the amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  the status and progress of our product development programs  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources  our stock price and the status of the capital markets 
in march  we sold  shares of our common stock to azimuth opportunity ltd  pursuant to an equity financing facility between the parties dated february   at an average purchase price of per share 
we received aggregate gross proceeds from this sale of million  or million net of issuance expenses 
the equity financing facility expired on september  on february   we sold  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering to institutional investors  at a purchase price of per share  resulting in net proceeds after fees and expenses of million 
the investors also received warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock exercisable at a price of per share in cash or pursuant to the net exercise provisions of the warrants 
at the election of the warrant holder  upon certain transactions  including a merger  tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the holder may receive cash in exchange for the warrant  in an amount determined by application of the black scholes option valuation model at the time of any such event  if the consideration received by the stockholders from such t ransaction is less than per share 
the warrants became exercisable on august  and will expire on february  if not exercised by that date 
as of march   no warrants have been exercised 
on august   we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering  including  shares of common stock upon exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option  at a purchase price of per share 
net proceeds of this offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions and direct expenses  were million 
following this offering  we had approximately million of securities remaining available under its shelf registration statement which expired on february   pursuant to sec rules 
we have filed shelf registration statements with the sec  from time to time  to register shares of our common stock or other securities for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when needed or otherwise considered appropriate 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  various series of debt securities and or warrants or rights to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units  with a total value of up to million  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering 
this filing was declared effective on january in march  we amended our existing term loan with a bank 
the amendment provided for an increase of million in our loan balance to million  the extension of the maturity date from march  to march   and changes to the repayment provisions 
the amended terms of the loan require us to maintain at least million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict additional indebtedness  additional liens  and sales of assets  and dividends  distributions or repurchases of common stock 
at december   the balance outstanding on our term loan agreement was million which has been classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
our up front payment from merck of million was received pursuant to our collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus 
this up front payment is included in cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  but is presented separately in this analysis due to the non recurring nature of this payment 
the agreement also provides for  among other things  the payment by merck of up to million in development and regulatory milestones during the remaining development of ridaforolimus  including million in milestone payments received through december  related to the start of various phase and the phase clinical trials  and up to million based on the achievement of specified product sales th resholds 
milestone payments  including the million in payments referred to above  are reflected as a reduction of cash used in operating activities in uses of funds later in this analysis 
uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements and  to a lesser degree  to repay our long term debt  to invest in intellectual property and to invest in property and equipment as needed for our business 
our uses of cash during the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities less up front payment from merck adjusted net cash used in operating activities repayment of long term borrowings investment in intangible assets investment in property and equipment net cash used in provided by operating activities is comprised of our net losses  adjusted for non cash expenses  deferred revenue  including deferrals of the up front and milestone payments received from merck  and working capital requirements 
adjusted net cash used in operating activities excludes the favorable impact of the non recurring  up front payment from merck of million in the third quarter of pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
as noted above  our net loss increased in and  due primarily to the increased costs of advancing our product candidates through clinical phases of development and expansion of business and commercial development initiatives and in patent litigation 
our adjusted net cash used in operating activities as presented above varied from year to y ear for the same reasons  including the favorable impact of milestone payments received from merck of million in  million in and million in as noted above  subject to available funding  we expect that our net loss will increase in due to ongoing development of our product candidates  that our investment in intangible assets  consisting of our intellectual property  will increase in in support of our product development activities  and that our investment in property and equipment will increase in to support growth of our r d and general and administrative functions 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities for financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we maintained outstanding letters of credit of  in accordance with the terms of our long term lease for our office and laboratory facility and for other purposes 
contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under our long term debt agreement  operating and capital lease agreements  employment agreements and benefit plans 
these non cancellable contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payments due by period total in through through after long term debt leases employment agreements other long term obligations long term debt consists of scheduled principal payments on such debt 
interest on our long term debt is based on variable interest rates 
assuming a constant interest rate of percent  the interest rate on our debt at december   over the remaining term of the debt  our interest expense would total approximately  in if we are not able to maintain compliance with our loan covenants in  we will be required to repay in the remaining principal balance of the loan  which was million at december  in addition  a covenant in the loan agreement requires that we not receive an audit report on our annual audited financial statements that includes a going concern explanatory paragraph within the audit report 
we have obtained a waiver from the bank related to this requirement for the year ended december  because we are unable to conclude that it is not probable that future covenant violations would not occur within the next twelve months  the entire term loan balance has been classified as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  leases consist of payments to be made on our lease for our office and laboratory facility  the term of which extends to july  and on agreements for certain assets acquired under capital leases which expire at various dates into employment agreements represent base salary payments under agreements with officers that extend for terms ranging from one to four years 
other long term obligations are comprised primarily of our obligations under our deferred executive compensation plans 
liquidity at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and working capital of million  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million at december  for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million and reported cash used in operating activities of million which reflects the favorable impact of million in milestone payments received from merck related to the start of phase clinical trials of ridaforolimus in patients with advanced prostate cancer and metastatic non small cell lung cancer 
on february   we raised net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock from our existing shelf registration statement at a price of per unit 
on august   we raised net proceeds of million from an underwritten public offering and sale of  shares of our common stock  including  shares of common stock from the exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option  at per share 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  various series of debt securities  and or warrants or rights to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units  with a total value of up to mill ion  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offerings 
this filing was declared effective on january  as of december   we had a warrant liability recorded of million which relates to warrants issued in february that are accounted for as a liability 
the warrants are classified as a derivative as the warrants do not qualify to be classified as an equity instrument as a result of the potential for cash settlement of the warrants 
our accounts payable balance is million lower at december  than december  as a result of the timing of payments made to our vendors 
subject to available funding  we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and net losses through at least as we advance our product development programs through clinical trials and non clinical studies 
there are numerous factors that are likely to affect our spending levels  including the terms of a potential revision to the collaboration agreement with merck for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus  the extent of clinical trials and other development activities for ridaforolimus in collaboration with merck  the timing and amount of milestone payments to be received from merck  the progress of our other product development  discovery research and preclinical programs  including activities related to ap and ap  and the impact of potential business development activities  among o ther factors 
in any case  we will require additional funding in to support our continuing research and development programs and related activities 
in recognition of our current financial resources and liquidity  since mid  we have reduced  deferred or eliminated previously planned spending on activities and initiatives that are not considered directly related to our highest priority programs and objectives or are committed obligations 
these actions have had a positive effect on our financial resources but will not be sufficient by themselves to eliminate the need to raise additional funding 
we are pursuing various potential sources of additional funding 
we are currently in advanced negotiations with merck regarding the terms of a revised collaboration agreement 
although there can be no assurance that we will ultimately execute a revised collaboration agreement with merck on terms acceptable to us  our current expectation is that the revised agreement will be entered into in the second quarter of if we do not finalize such a revised agreement as currently anticipated  we will seek to raise the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through equity offerings  debt financings and pursuit of other strategic options 
we are also pursuing partnering opportunities with our earlier stage product candidates  ap and ap  which could generate up front and milestone payments as well as funding of on going development costs and other licensing possibilities with our technologies 
if we are unable to execute a revised collaboration agreement with merck on a timely basis  we will need to raise funds from other sources and further reduce our operating expenses in order to continue operating our business 
in such circumstances  we may seek to raise funds by issuing common stock or other securities in one or more private placements or public offerings  or through the issuance of debt  or through licensing of our product candidates and other technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funding from the above sources on terms acceptable to us or at all 
depending upon the success of such financing efforts  our expense reductions could include the discontinuance of most development activities other than those for which we have contractual commitments and a substanti al reduction in our staff 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted  and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations  strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties  we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are not successful in our efforts to secure additional funding as described above or otherwise reduce spending to conserve our cash resources  our cash and cash equivalents as of december  will not be sufficient to fund our operations beyond the second quarter of  and thus there is substantial uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern 
recently adopted or issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that modifies the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
this guidance requires an entity to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in multiple deliverable arrangements based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
it also changes the level of evidence of stand alone selling prices required to separate deliverables by requiring an entity to make its best estimate of the stand alone selling price of the deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available 
implementation of this guidance is required no later than fiscal years beginning after june  and this guidance may be applied prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements af ter the effective date or retrospectively 
early application is permitted 
this guidance may impact our determination of the separation of deliverables for future arrangements or for material modifications to its current collaboration with merck 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term  highly liquid securities  with original maturities of days or less  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government and agency securities 
maturities of our marketable securities are generally limited to periods necessary to fund our liquidity needs and may not in any case exceed three years 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe  however  that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows generally would not be material due to the current short term nature of these investments 
in particular  at december   because our available funds were invested solely in cash equivalents  our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
we record as a liability the fair value of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock issued to investors in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock on february  the fair value of this warrant liability is determined using the black scholes option valuation model and is therefore sensitive to changes in the market price and volatility of our common stock among other factors 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the market price based on the market price of our stock at december  of our common stock on which the december  valuation was based  the value would have increased by million 
such increase would have been reflected as additional loss on revaluation of the warrant liability in our statement of operations 
at december   we had million outstanding under a bank term note which bears interest at prime or  alternatively  libor plus to percent 
this note is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a hypothetical percent increase in the interest rate on which the loan is based basis points at december   we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year based on expected balances over the next twelve months
