table of contents company history the company began operations in as the haynes stellite works  which was purchased by union carbide and carbon corporation in in  the operations were sold to cabot corporation 
in  haynes was incorporated as a stand alone corporation in delaware  and in haynes was sold by cabot corporation to morgan lewis githens ahn inc  a private investment firm 
the blackstone group  a private investment firm  purchased haynes from morgan lewis githens ahn inc in haynes encountered liquidity difficulties throughout fiscal and the first half of fiscal due to concurrent downcycles in its largest markets  and rising raw material and energy costs  the company could not generate sufficient cash to both satisfy its debt service obligations and fund operations 
on march   haynes and its us subsidiaries and affiliates as of that date filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
on august   haynes emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to a court approved plan of reorganization 
in november  haynes acquired certain assets of the branford wire company  including a facility that manufactured both stainless steel wire and high performance alloy wire 
the company primarily produces high performance alloy wire  but continues to produce stainless steel wire on a limited basis at the haynes wire company  in mountain home  north carolina 
on march   the company completed an equity offering  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of its common stock 
simultaneously the company listed its common stock on the nasdaq global market 
products the global specialty alloy market consists of three primary sectors stainless steel  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
the company believes that the high performance alloy sector represents less than of the total alloy market 
the company competes exclusively in the high performance nickel and cobalt based alloy sectors  which includes hta products and cra products 
in fiscal  and  hta products accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues  respectively  and sales of the company s cra products accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues  respectively 
these percentages are based on data which include revenue associated with sales by the company to its foreign subsidiaries  but exclude revenue associated with sales by foreign subsidiaries to their customers 
management believes  however  that the effect of including revenue data associated with sales by its foreign subsidiaries would not materially change the percentages presented in this section 
high temperature resistant alloys 
hta products are used primarily in manufacturing components for the hot sections of gas turbine engines 
stringent safety and performance standards in the aerospace industry result in development lead times typically as long as eight to ten years in the introduction of new aerospace related market applications for hta products 
however  once a particular new alloy is shown to possess the properties required for a specific application in the aerospace market  it tends to remain in use for extended periods 
hta products are also used in gas turbine engines produced for use in applications such as naval and commercial vessels  electric power generation  power sources for offshore drilling platforms  gas pipeline booster stations and emergency standby power stations 
the following table sets

represents a product which the company believes has limited or no significant competition 
corrosion resistant alloys 
cra products are used in a variety of applications  such as chemical processing  power plant emissions control  hazardous waste treatment  sour gas production and pharmaceutical vessels 
historically  the chemical processing market has represented the largest end user sector for cra products 
due to maintenance  safety and environmental considerations  the company believes this market continues to represent an area of potential long term growth 
unlike aerospace applications within the hta product market  the development of new market applications for cra products generally does not require long lead times 
the following table sets forth information with respect 
table of contents to certain of the company s significant corrosion resistant alloys  applications and features new cra development is discussed below under patents and trademarks alloy and year introduced end markets and applications features hastelloy c alloy cpi tanks  mixers  piping versatile alloy with good resistance to uniform corrosion hastelloy b alloy cpi acetic acid plants better fabrication characteristics compared to other nickel molybdenum alloys hastelloy d alloy cpi plate heat exchangers corrosion resistance to hot sulfuric acid ultimet alloy cpi pumps  valves wear and corrosion resistant nickel based alloy hastelloy c alloy cpi fgd tanks  mixers  piping resistance to localized corrosion and pitting hastelloy g alloy cpi tanks  mixers  piping lower cost alloy with good corrosion resistance in phosphoric acid hastelloy g alloy cpi tanks  heat exchangers  piping improved corrosion resistance to phosphoric acid with excellent resistance to corrosion in highly oxidizing media hastelloy c alloy cpi fgd oil and gas tanks  mixers  piping broad resistance to many environments cpi refers to the chemical processing industry  fgd refers to the flue gas desulphurization industry 
represents a patented product or a product to which the company believes has limited or no significant competition 
patents and trademarks the company currently maintains a total of approximately us patents and applications and approximately foreign counterpart patents and applications targeted at countries with significant or potential markets for the patented products and continues to develop  manufacture and test high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
since fiscal  the company s technical programs have yielded six new proprietary alloys  four of which are currently commercially available and two of which are being scaled up to be brought to market 
of the alloys which are being commercialized  two alloys saw advancement in the process during fiscal first  haynes alloy  which management believes will have significant commercial potential for the company in the long term  is the subject of a patent application filed in fiscal haynes alloy has excellent formability  fabricability and forgeability 
the commercial launch of haynes alloy occurred in october and  since that time  there have been more than customer tests and evaluations of this product for the hot sections of gas turbines in the aerospace and land based gas turbine markets  as well as for automotive and other high temperature applications 
the company will continue to actively promote haynes alloy through customer engineering visits and technical presentations and papers 
in addition  commercialization of hastelloy c hs alloy also continued in fiscal the company has been providing customers with samples of this alloy and making technical presentations since testing and evaluation of the alloy is ongoing with special emphasis on applications for the oil and gas market 
it is important to note  however  that both of these alloys are in the early stages of commercialization and pounds sold to date are very low compared to the company s other proprietary alloys  furthermore  pounds sold in the next three to five years are expected to remain at low levels 
the company believes that the alloys particularly haynes alloy are significantly further along the commercialization curve when compared to historical trends for other proprietary alloys introduced by the company 
in addition to 
table of contents haynes alloy and hastelloy c hs alloy  commercialization is also ongoing for hastelloy hybrid bc alloy 
hastelloy hybrid bc alloy  a cra product with potential applications in the chemical processing industry  has demonstrated resistance to hydrochloric and sulfuric acid 
in addition to the commercialization of the above alloys  the company continues to scale up new alloys not yet ready to begin the commercialization process 
us patent applications were filed in fiscal and for the haynes ns alloy and haynes hr alloy  respectively 
both of these new materials are believed to have significant  medium to long term commercial potential 
haynes ns alloy is a new alloy with extraordinary high temperature strength in sheet form  which has applications in the aerospace  land based gas turbine and automotive markets 
data generation and fabrication trials continued through  with test marketing initiated in early haynes hr alloy is an hta product with superior resistance to oxidation 
scale up of this alloy is continuing and test marketing was initiated in fiscal patents or other proprietary rights are an important element of the company s business 
the company s strategy is to file patent applications in the us and any other country that represents an important potential commercial market to the company 
in addition  the company seeks to protect its technology which is important to the development of the company s business 
the company also relies upon trade secret rights to protect its technologies and its development of new applications and alloys 
the company protects its trade secrets in part through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with its customers 
trademarks on the names of many of the company s alloys have also been applied for or granted in the us and certain foreign countries 
while the company believes its patents are important to its competitive position  significant barriers to entry continue to exist beyond the expiration of any patent period 
these barriers to entry and production include the unique equipment required to produce this material and the exacting process required to achieve the desired metallurgical properties 
these processing requirements include such items as specific annealing temperature  processing speeds and reduction per rolling pass 
management believes that the current alloy development program and these barriers to entry reduce the impact of patent expirations on the company 
end markets the company estimates that the global specialty alloy market  including stainless steels  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys  represents total production volume of approximately billion pounds per annum 
of this total market  the company competes in the high performance nickel and cobalt based alloy sector  which is estimated to represent approximately million pounds of production per annum 
the high performance alloy market demands diverse  specialty alloys suitable for use in precision manufacturing 
given the technologically advanced nature of the products  strict requirements of the end users and higher growth end markets  the company believes the high performance alloy sector provides greater growth potential  higher profit margins and greater opportunities for service  product and price differentiation than stainless steels and general purpose nickel alloys 
while stainless steel and general purpose nickel alloy is generally sold in bulk through third party distributors  the company s products are sold in smaller sized orders which are customized and typically handled on a direct to customer basis 
aerospace 
the company has manufactured hta products for the aerospace market since the late s  and has developed numerous proprietary alloys for this market 
customers in the aerospace market tend to be the most demanding with respect to meeting specifications within very low tolerances and achieving new product performance standards 
stringent safety standards and continuous efforts to reduce equipment weight require close coordination between the company and its customers in the selection and development of hta products 
as a result  sales to aerospace customers tend to be made through the 
table of contents company s direct sales force 
demand for the company s products in the aerospace market is based on the new and replacement market for jet engines and the maintenance needs of operators of commercial and military aircraft 
the hot sections of jet engines are subjected to substantial wear and tear and accordingly require periodic maintenance  repair and overhaul 
the company views the maintenance  repair and overhaul business as an area of continuing long term growth 
chemical processing 
the chemical processing market represents a large base of customers with diverse cra applications driven by demand for key end use markets such as automobiles  housing  health care  agriculture  and metals production 
cra products supplied by the company have been used in the chemical processing market since the early s 
demand for the company s products in this market is driven by the level of maintenance  repair and expansion requirements of existing chemical processing facilities  as well as the construction of new facilities 
the company believes the extensive worldwide network of company owned service and sales centers  as well as its network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company s direct sales efforts outside of the us  provide a competitive advantage in marketing its cra products in the chemical processing market 
land based gas turbines 
demand for the company s products in this market is driven by the construction of cogeneration facilities such as base load for electric utilities or as backup sources to fossil fuel fired utilities during times of peak demand 
demand for the company s alloys in the land based gas turbine markets has also been driven by concerns regarding lowering emissions from generating facilities powered by fossil fuels 
land based gas turbine generating facilities have gained acceptance as clean  low cost alternatives to fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
land based gas turbines are also used in power barges with mobility and as temporary base load generating units for countries that have numerous islands and a large coastline 
demand is also generated by mechanical drive units used for oil and gas production and pipeline transportation  as well as microturbines that are used as back up sources of power generation for hospitals and shopping malls 
with a service center in china and sales centers in india and singapore  the company is well positioned to take advantage of the long term growth potential in those areas in demand for power generation 
other markets 
other markets to which the company sells its hta products and cra products include flue gas desulphurization or fgd  oil and gas  waste incineration  industrial heat treating  automotive  instrumentation  biopharmaceuticals  solar and nuclear fuel 
the fgd market has been driven by both legislated and self imposed standards for lowering emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
with the completion of the company s recent capital projects  the company anticipates increasing its participation in the fgd market due to the increased production capacity and the improved cost structure which resulted from the completion of the capital projects 
the company also sells its products for use in the oil and gas market  primarily in connection with sour gas production 
in addition  incineration of municipal  biological  industrial and hazardous waste products typically produces very corrosive conditions that demand high performance alloys 
the company continues to look for opportunities to introduce and expand the use of its alloys in emerging technologies such as solar and nuclear fuel applications 
markets capable of providing growth are being driven by increasing performance  reliability and service life requirements for products used in these markets which could provide further applications for the company s products 
sales and marketing and distribution the company sells its products primarily through its direct sales organization  which operates from total locations in the us  europe  asia and india  of which are service and or sales centers 
all of the company s service and or sales centers are operated either directly by the company or through its wholly owned subsidiaries 
approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal were generated by the company s direct sales organization 
the remaining of the company s fiscal net revenues was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company s direct sales in the us  europe and asia  some of whom have been associated with the company for over 
table of contents years 
going forward  the company expects its direct sales force to continue to generate approximately of its total net revenues 
providing technical assistance to customers is an important part of the company s marketing strategy 
the company provides performance analyses of its products and those of its competitors for its customers 
these analyses enable the company to evaluate the performance of its products and to make recommendations as to the use of those products in appropriate applications  enabling the products to be included as part of the technical specifications used in the production of customers products 
the company s market development professionals are assisted by its engineering and technology staff in directing the sales force to new opportunities 
management believes the company s combination of direct sales  technical marketing  engineering and customer support provides an advantage over other manufacturers in the high performance alloy industry 
this activity allows the company to obtain direct insight into customers alloy needs and to develop proprietary alloys that provide solutions to customers problems 
the company continues to focus on growing its business in foreign markets 
in recent years  the company opened a service and sales center in china  the first service and sales center operated by any manufacturer of nickel and cobalt based alloys in china  and sales centers in singapore  india and italy 
although sales to china in fiscal were approximately million  compared to million in fiscal  for the long term  management continues to view china as an expanding market opportunity for the company 
that is why the company continues to evaluate the possibility of opening a second service center in china  although global economic conditions may continue to delay this decision 
while the company is making concentrated efforts to expand foreign sales  the majority of its revenue continues to be provided by sales to us customers 
the company s domestic expansion effort includes  but is not limited to  the continued expansion of ancillary product forms  the continued development of new high performance alloys  the utilization of external conversion resources to expand and improve the quality of mill produced product  the addition of equipment in us service and sales centers to improve the company s ability to provide a product closer to the form required by the customer and the continued effort through the technical expertise of the company to find solutions to customer challenges 
the following table sets forth the approximate percentage of the company s fiscal net revenues generated through each of the company s distribution channels 
from domestic locations from foreign locations total company mill direct service and sales centers independent distributors sales agents total the company s top twenty customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
no customer or group of affiliated customers of the company accounted for more than of the company s net revenues in fiscal  or net revenues and net income loss in fiscal  and were generated primarily by the company s us operations 
sales to domestic customers comprised approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the majority of the company s operating costs are incurred in the us  as all of its manufacturing facilities are located in the us it is expected that net revenues and net income will continue to be highly dependent on the company s domestic sales and manufacturing facilities in the us 
table of contents the company s foreign and export sales were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
additional information concerning foreign operations and export sales is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
manufacturing process high performance alloys require a lengthier  more complex production process and are more difficult to manufacture than lower performance alloys  such as stainless steel 
the alloying elements in high performance alloys must be highly refined during melting  and the manufacturing process must be tightly controlled to produce precise chemical properties 
the resulting alloyed material is more difficult to process because  by design  it is more resistant to deformation 
consequently  high performance alloys require that a greater force be applied when hot or cold working and are less susceptible to reduction or thinning when rolling or forging 
this results in more cycles of rolling  annealing and pickling compared to a lower performance alloy to achieve proper dimensions 
certain alloys may undergo as many as distinct stages of melting  remelting  annealing  forging  rolling and pickling before they achieve the specifications required by a customer 
the company manufactures its high performance alloys in various forms  including sheet  plate  billet ingot  tubular  wire and other forms 
the manufacturing process begins with raw materials being combined  melted and refined in a precise manner to produce the chemical composition specified for each high performance alloy 
for most high performance alloys  this molten material is cast into electrodes and additionally refined through electroslag remelting 
the resulting ingots are then forged or rolled to an intermediate shape and size depending upon the intended final product form 
intermediate shapes destined for flat products are then sent through a series of hot and cold rolling  annealing and pickling operations before being cut to final size 
the argon oxygen decarburization gas controls in the company s primary melt facility remove carbon and other undesirable elements  thereby allowing more tightly controlled chemistries  which in turn produce more consistent properties in the high performance alloys 
the argon oxygen decarburization gas control system also allows for statistical process control monitoring in real time to improve product quality 
the company has a four high steckel rolling mill for use in hot rolling high performance alloys  created specifically for that purpose 
the four high steckel rolling mill was installed in and is one of only two such mills in the high performance alloy industry 
the mill is capable of generating approximately million pounds of separating force and rolling a plate up to inches wide 
the mill includes integrated computer controls with automatic gauge control and programmed rolling schedules  two coiling steckel furnaces and five heating furnaces 
computer controlled rolling schedules for each of the hundreds of combinations of product shapes and sizes the company produces allow the mill to roll numerous widths and gauges to exact specifications without stoppages or changeovers 
the company also operates a three high rolling mill and a two high rolling mill  each of which is capable of custom processing much smaller quantities of material than the four high steckel rolling mill 
these mills provide the company with significant flexibility in running smaller batches of varied products in response to customer requirements 
the company believes the flexibility provided by the three high and two high mills provides the company an advantage over its major competitors in obtaining smaller specialty orders 
investments in plant and equipment have allowed the company to increase capacity  reduce unplanned equipment outages  produce higher quality products at reduced costs and improve working capital management 
the company spent million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal on plant and equipment upgrades 
the significant investments over the last several years were the result of under investment in prior years  as well as increases in customer demand and quality requirements 
the principal benefits of these investments are improved machine reliability  
table of contents improved product quality  increased processing efficiency  increased capacity  reduced maintenance costs and reduced risk of unplanned outages 
as announced at the beginning of fiscal  the company plans to spend  in total  approximately million over fiscal years through on new strategic initiatives  routine capital maintenance projects and restructuring its service centers 
this amount includes approximately million on upgrades to its four high steckel rolling mill and supporting equipment  approximately million on other equipment purchases and upgrades and approximately million on routine capital maintenance projects 
in addition  the company is finalizing plans to spend approximately million over the course of fiscal and to restructure  consolidate and enhance capabilities at its service center operations to improve the return on assets at those operations 
management does not anticipate prolonged equipment outages as a result of upgrades for any of these projects 
these projects are expected to improve quality  improve inventory turnover  reduce operating costs  improve delivery performance and decrease cycle time 
capital spending in fiscal was million  compared to an original target of approximately million excluding any amounts for service center restructuring 
the difference of million between the original forecast and the actual spending includes million related to the timing of completion of a project for the company s four high steckel rolling mill that was started in fiscal  but which will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal the target for capital spending in fiscal is approximately million  plus additional amounts for the restructuring of the company s service centers 
management estimates that spending on the service center project will be approximately million over the course of fiscal and backlog the company defines backlog to include firm commitments from customers for delivery of product at established prices 
approximately of the orders in the backlog at any given time include prices that are subject to adjustment based on changes in raw material costs 
historically  approximately of the company s backlog orders have shipped within six months and approximately have shipped within months 
the backlog figures do not reflect that portion of the company s business conducted at its service and sales centers on a spot or just in time basis 
consolidated backlog at fiscal quarter end in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter raw materials in fiscal  nickel  a major component of many of the company s products  accounted for approximately of raw material costs  or approximately of total cost of sales 
other raw materials include cobalt  chromium  molybdenum and tungsten 
melt materials consist of virgin raw material  purchased scrap and internally produced scrap 
the average nickel price per pound for cash buyers for the day period ended on september   and  as reported by the london metals exchange  was  and  respectively 
prices for other raw materials which are significant in the manufacture of the company s products  such as molybdenum  cobalt and chromium  were also higher in fiscal than fiscal 
table of contents since most of the company s products are produced pursuant to specific orders  the company purchases raw materials against known production schedules 
the materials are purchased from several different suppliers through various arrangements including annual contracts and spot purchases  and involve a variety of pricing mechanisms 
because the company maintains a policy of pricing its products at the time of order placement  the company attempts to establish selling prices with reference to known costs of materials  thereby reducing the risk associated with changes in the cost of raw materials 
however  to the extent that the price of nickel fluctuates rapidly  there may be an unfavorable effect on the company s gross profit margins 
the company periodically purchases material forward with certain suppliers 
research and technical support the company s technology facilities are located at the kokomo headquarters and consist of  square feet of offices and laboratories  as well as an additional  square feet of paved storage area 
the company has six fully equipped technology testing laboratories  including a mechanical test lab  a metallographic lab  an electron microscopy lab  a corrosion lab  a high temperature lab and a welding lab 
these facilities also contain a reduced scale  fully equipped melt shop and process lab 
as of september   the technology  engineering and technological testing staff consisted of persons  of whom have engineering or science degrees  including with doctoral degrees  with the majority of degrees in the field of metallurgical engineering 
research and technical support costs primarily relate to efforts to develop new proprietary alloys and new applications for existing alloys 
the company spent approximately million  million and million for research and technical support activities for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  research and development projects were focused on new alloy development  new product form development and new alloy concept validation  all relating to products for the aerospace  land based gas turbine  chemical processing and oil and gas industries 
in addition  significant projects were conducted to generate technical data in support of major market application opportunities in areas such as renewable energy  fuel cell systems  biotechnology including toxic waste incineration and pharmaceutical manufacturing  and power generation 
competition the high performance alloy market is a highly competitive market in which eight to ten major producers participate in various product forms 
the company s primary competitors in flat rolled products include special metals corporation  a subsidiary of precision cast parts  allegheny technologies  inc and krupp vdm gmbh  a subsidiary of thyssen krupp stainless 
the company faces strong competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of both high performance alloys similar to those the company produces and other competing metals 
the company may face additional competition in the future to the extent new materials are developed  such as plastics or ceramics  that may be substituted for the company s products 
the company also believes that it will face increased competition from non us entities in the next five to ten years  especially from competitors located in eastern europe and asia 
additionally  in recent years the company has benefited from a weak us dollar  which makes the goods of foreign competitors more expensive to import into the us in the event that the us dollar strengthens  the company may face increased competition in the us from foreign competitors 
starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  the company experienced strong price competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys due primarily to weakness in the stainless market 
historically  the company experienced similar price competition in the s and in the early s  when demand in the stainless market weakened 
increased competition has required the company to continually price our product competitively  which has contributed to the reduction in the company s gross profit margin and net income 
although the economic environment has modestly improved  there continues to be significant 
table of contents uncertainty as to when the stainless market will return to the pre recession levels 
when stainless demand begins to improve  price competition in the high performance alloy industry should begin to ease 
the company continues to respond to the competition by increasing emphasis on service centers  offering value added services  improving its cost structure  and striving to improve delivery times and reliability 
at this time  however  continued weakness in the economy continues to generate intense competitive pricing pressure 
employees as of september   the company employed approximately full time employees worldwide 
all eligible hourly employees at the kokomo plant and the lebanon  indiana service and sales center approximately in the aggregate are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
on july   the company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers of america  which will expire in june management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory 
in september  a majority of the hourly employees at the company s arcadia  louisiana operations elected to be represented by the united steelworkers of america  although no collective bargaining agreement is in place at this time and negotiations are ongoing 
none of the other employees at the company s domestic operations are represented by a labor union 
environmental matters the company s facilities and operations are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage  handling  use  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
in the us  such laws include the occupational  safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the toxic substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
as environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve  it is likely the company will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future  particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues  such as a reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
violations of these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial penalties and can require facilities improvements 
expenses related to environmental compliance were approximately million for fiscal and are expected to be approximately million for fiscal although there can be no assurance  based upon current information available to the company  the company does not expect that costs of environmental contingencies  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the company s facilities are subject to periodic inspection by various regulatory authorities  who from time to time have issued findings of violations of governing laws  regulations and permits 
in the past five years  the company has paid administrative fines  none of which have had a material effect on the company s financial condition  for alleged violations relating to environmental matters  including the handling and storage of hazardous wastes  requirements relating to its title v air permit  requirements relating to the handling of polychlorinated biphenyls and violations of record keeping and notification requirements relating to industrial waste water discharge 
capital expenditures of approximately million were made for pollution control improvements during fiscal  with additional expenditures of approximately million for similar improvements planned for fiscal the company has received permits from the indiana department of environmental management  or idem  to close and to provide post closure monitoring and care for certain areas at the kokomo facility previously used for the storage and disposal of wastes  some of which are classified as hazardous under applicable regulations 
closure certification was received in fiscal for the south landfill at the kokomo facility and post closure monitoring and care is ongoing there 
closure certification was received in fiscal for the north landfill at the kokomo facility and post closure monitoring and care are permitted and ongoing there 
in fiscal  idem issued a single post closure permit applicable to both the north and south landfills  which contains monitoring and post closure care requirements 
in addition  
table of contents idem required that a resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  facility investigation  or rfi  be conducted in order to further evaluate one area of concern and one solid waste management unit 
the rfi commenced in fiscal and is ongoing 
based on preliminary results  the company has determined that additional testing and further source remediation are necessary 
the company has also received permits from the north carolina department of environment and natural resources  or ncdenr  to close and provide post closure monitoring and care for the hazardous waste lagoon at its mountain home  north carolina facility 
the lagoon area has been closed and is currently undergoing post closure monitoring and care 
the company is required to monitor groundwater and to continue post closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site 
as a result  the company is aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater and additional corrective action by the company could be required 
the company is unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at these sites  if required 
accordingly  the company cannot assure that the costs of any future corrective action at these or any other current former sites would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
additionally  it is possible that the company could be required to undertake other corrective action commitments for any other solid waste management unit existing or determined to exist at its facilities 
as a condition of the post closure permits  the company must provide and maintain assurances to idem and ncdenr of the company s capability to satisfy closure and post closure groundwater monitoring requirements  including possible future corrective action as necessary 
the company provides these required assurances through a statutory financial assurance test as provided by indiana and north carolina law 
the company may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances 
the company s operations generate hazardous substances  and  while a large percentage of these substances are reclaimed or recycled  the company also accumulates hazardous substances at each of its facilities for subsequent transportation and disposal off site by third parties 
generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or cercla  and state counterparts 
cercla imposes strict  joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators  site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties 
the company may have generated hazardous substances disposed of at other sites potentially subject to cercla or equivalent state law remedial action 
thus  there can be no assurance that the company will not be named as a potentially responsible party at sites in the future or that the costs associated with those sites would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our revenues may fluctuate widely based upon changes in demand for our customers products 
demand for our products is dependent upon and derived from the level of demand for the machinery  parts and equipment produced by our customers  which are principally manufacturers and fabricators of machinery  parts and equipment for highly specialized applications 
historically  certain of the markets in which we compete have experienced unpredictable  wide demand fluctuations 
because of the comparatively high level of fixed costs associated with our manufacturing processes  significant declines in those markets have had a disproportionately adverse impact on our operating results 
since we became an independent company in  we have  in several instances  experienced substantial year to year declines in net revenues  primarily as a result of decreases in demand in the industries to which our products are sold 
in     and  our net revenues  when compared to the immediately preceding year  declined by approximately     and  respectively 
we may experience similar fluctuations in our net revenues in the future 
additionally  demand is likely to continue to be subject to substantial year to year fluctuations as a consequence of industry cyclicality  as well as other factors such as global economic uncertainty  and such fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
profitability in the high performance alloy industry is highly sensitive to changes in sales volumes 
the high performance alloy industry is characterized by high capital investment and high fixed costs 
the cost of raw materials is the primary variable cost in the manufacture of our high performance alloys and  in fiscal  represented approximately of our total cost of sales 
other manufacturing costs  such as labor  energy  maintenance and supplies  often thought of as variable  have a significant fixed element 
profitability is  therefore  very sensitive to changes in volume  and relatively small changes in volume can result in significant variations in earnings 
our ability to effectively utilize our manufacturing assets depends greatly upon continuing demand in our end markets  successfully increasing our market share and continued acceptance of our new products into the marketplace 
any failure to effectively utilize our manufacturing assets may negatively impact our gross margin and net income 
we are subject to risks associated with global economic and political uncertainties we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states and abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the demand of our customers 
the continuing turmoil in the global financial system has had  and may continue to have  an impact on our business and our financial condition 
in addition to the impact that the global financial crisis has already had  we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve or worsen 
in addition  we are subject to various domestic and international risks and uncertainties  including changing social conditions and uncertainties relating to the current and future political climate 
changes in governmental policies particularly those that would limit or reduce defense spending could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may reduce our customers demand for our products and or depress pricing of those products used in the defense industry or which have other military applications  resulting in a material adverse impact on our business  prospects  results of operations  revenues and cash flows 
furthermore  any actual armed hostilities  and any future terrorist attacks in the us or abroad  could also have an adverse impact on the us economy  global financial markets and our business 
the effects may include  among other things  a decrease in demand in the aerospace industry due to reduced air travel  as well as reduced demand in the other industries we serve 
depending upon the severity  scope and duration of these effects  the impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be material 

table of contents we operate in cyclical markets 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the highly cyclical aerospace  power generation and chemical processing markets 
our sales to the aerospace industry constituted of our total sales in fiscal our land based gas turbine and chemical processing sales constituted and  respectively  of our total sales in fiscal the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft 
the us and international commercial aviation industries continue to face challenges arising from the global economic climate  competitive pressures and fuel costs 
demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by industry profitability  trends in airline passenger traffic  the state of us and world economies  the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors  including the effects of terrorism and health and safety concerns 
the military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding  however  it is also driven by the effects of terrorism  a changing global political environment  us foreign policy  the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability 
accordingly  the timing  duration and severity of cyclical upturns and downturns cannot be forecast with certainty 
downturns or reductions in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the land based gas turbine market is also cyclical in nature 
demand for power generation products is global and is affected by the state of the us and world economies  the availability of financing to power generation project sponsors and the political environments of numerous countries 
the availability of fuels and related prices also have a large impact on demand 
reductions in demand for our products sold into the land based gas turbine industry may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also sell products into the chemical processing industry  which is also cyclical in nature 
customer demand for our products in this market may fluctuate widely depending on us and world economic conditions  the availability of financing  and the general economic strength of the end use customers in this market 
cyclical declines or sustained weakness in this market could have a material adverse effect on our business 
aerospace demand is dependent on primarily two manufacturers 
a significant portion of our aerospace products are sold to fabricators and are ultimately used in the production of new commercial aircraft 
there are only two primary manufacturers of large commercial aircraft in the world  the boeing company and airbus 
a significant portion of our aerospace sales are dependent on the number of new aircraft built by these two manufacturers  which is in turn dependent on a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
those factors include demand for new aircraft from around the globe and factors that impact manufacturing capabilities  such as the availability of raw materials and manufactured components  changes in the regulatory environment and labor relations between the aircraft manufacturers and their work forces 
a significant interruption or slow down in the number of new aircraft built by the aircraft manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are dependent on production levels at our kokomo facility 
our principal assets are located at our primary integrated production facility in kokomo  indiana and at our production facilities in arcadia  louisiana and in mountain home  north carolina 
the arcadia and mountain home plants rely to a significant extent upon feedstock produced at the kokomo facility 
any production failures  shutdowns or other significant problems at the kokomo facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain property damage insurance to provide for reconstruction of damaged equipment  as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production shutdown caused by an insured loss 
although we believe 
table of contents that our insurance is adequate to cover any such losses that may not be the case 
one or more significant uninsured losses at our kokomo facility may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  from time to time we schedule planned outages on the equipment at our kokomo facility for maintenance and upgrades 
these projects are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including a variety of market  operational and labor related factors  many of which may be beyond our control 
should a planned shut down on a significant piece of equipment last materially longer than originally planned  there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results 
during periods of lower demand in other alloy markets  some of our competitors may use their available capacity to produce higher volumes of high performance alloys  which leads to increased competition in the high performance alloy market 
we have experienced increased competition since the third quarter of fiscal from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys 
due to continued under utilization of capacity in the stainless steel market  we believe these competitors increased their production levels and sales activity in high performance alloys to keep capacity in their mills as full as possible  while offering very competitive prices and delivery times 
while competition should soften as the stainless market improves  based on the current economic environment there continues to be significant capacity available in the stainless market with which we are competing 
increased competition has required us to lower prices  which has contributed to the reduction in our gross profit margin 
in addition  as a result of the competition in our markets  we have made significant price concessions to our customers from time to time  and we expect customer pressure for further price concessions to continue 
maintenance of our market share will depend  in part  on our ability to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be cost competitive 
if we are unable to adjust our costs relative to our pricing  our profitability will suffer 
our effectiveness in managing our cost structure will be a key determinate of future profitability and competitiveness 
rapid fluctuations in the price of nickel may materially adversely affect our operating results 
to the extent that we are unable to adjust to rapid fluctuations in the price of nickel  there may be a negative effect on our gross profit margins 
in fiscal  nickel  a major component of many of our products  accounted for approximately of our raw material costs  or approximately of our total costs of sales 
we enter into several different types of sales contracts with our customers  some of which allow us to pass on increases in nickel prices to our customers 
in other cases  we price our products at the time of order  which allows us to establish prices with reference to known costs of our nickel inventory  but which does not allow us to offset an unexpected rise in the price of nickel 
we may not be able to successfully offset rapid increases in the price of nickel or other raw materials in the future 
in the event that raw material price increases occur that we are unable to pass on to our customers  our cash flows or results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
alternatively  as happened in fiscal  our results of operations may also be negatively impacted if both customer demand and nickel prices rapidly fall at the same time 
in those circumstances  we may experience higher per pound manufacturing costs due to the recognition of higher nickel costs from inventory which flows through cost of goods sold 
our business is dependent on a number of raw materials that are subject to volatility in price and availability 
we use a number of raw materials in our products which are found in only a few parts of the world and are available from a limited number of suppliers 
the availability and costs of these materials may be influenced by private or government cartels  changes in world politics  labor relations between the materials producers and their work force  unstable governments in exporting nations and inflation 
the ability of key material suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can also impact our ability to 
table of contents meet commitments to customers 
future shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could result in decreased sales as well as margins  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
the enactment of new or increased import duties on raw materials imported by us could also increase the costs to us of obtaining the raw materials and might adversely affect our business 
failure to successfully develop  commercialize  market and sell new applications and new products could adversely affect our business 
we believe that our proprietary alloys and metallurgical manufacturing expertise provide us with a competitive advantage over other high performance alloy producers 
our ability to maintain this competitive advantage depends on our ability to continue to offer products that have equal or better performance characteristics than competing products at competitive prices 
our future growth will depend  in part  on our ability to address the increasingly demanding needs of our customers by enhancing the properties of our existing alloys  by timely developing new applications for our existing products  and by timely developing  commercializing  marketing and selling new products 
if we are not successful in these efforts  or our new products and product enhancements do not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance  our revenues  cash flows and results of operations could be negatively affected 
an interruption in energy services may cause manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns 
we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products 
the prices for and availability of electricity  natural gas  oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions 
these market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control 
disruptions in the supply of energy resources could temporarily impair the ability to manufacture products for customers 
further  increases in energy costs  or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors  has and may continue to adversely affect our profitability 
to the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive  increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by environmental  health and safety laws  regulations  costs and other liabilities 
we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment  the storage  handling  use  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the health and safety of our employees 
under these laws and regulations  we may be held liable for all costs arising out of any release of hazardous substances on  under or from any of our current or former properties or any off site location to which we sent or arranged to be sent wastes for disposal or treatment  and such costs may be material 
we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other hazardous substances that may be attributable to our products or other environmental damage 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations require our facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification 
these laws  regulations and permits can require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment 
violations of these laws  regulations or permits can also result in the imposition of substantial penalties  permit revocations and or facility shutdowns 
we have received permits from the environmental regulatory authorities in indiana and north carolina to close and to provide post closure monitoring and care for certain areas of our kokomo and mountain home facilities that were used for the storage and disposal of wastes  some of which are classified as hazardous under applicable regulations 
we are required to monitor groundwater and to continue post closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site 
as a result  we are aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater and additional corrective action could be required 
additionally  it is possible that we could be required to undertake other corrective action for any 
table of contents other solid waste management unit existing or determined to exist at our facilities 
we are unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action  if required 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that the costs of future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances 
our operations generate hazardous substances  many of which we accumulate at our facilities for subsequent transportation and disposal off site or recycling by third parties 
generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to liability under cercla and state counterparts 
in addition  we may have generated hazardous substances disposed of at sites which are subject to cercla or equivalent state law remedial action 
cercla imposes strict  joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators  site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault 
we cannot assure you that we will not be named as a potentially responsible party at sites in the future or that the costs associated with current or future additional sites would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with environmental laws  we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances will not materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see business environmental matters 
our manufacturing processes  and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers  are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  and pending legislation or regulation of greenhouse gases  if enacted or adopted in an onerous form  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
political and scientific debates related to the impacts of emissions of greenhouse gases on the global climate are prevalent 
regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas emissions is currently being considered in the united states as well as globally 
as a high performance alloy manufacturer  we will be affected  both directly and indirectly  if proposed climate change legislation  such as use of a cap and trade  is enacted which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we could be required to make additional contributions to our defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 
our estimates of liabilities and expenses for pension benefits incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  retirement age and mortality 
we currently expect that we will be required to make future minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
a decline in the value of plan investments in the future  an increase in costs or liabilities or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
a requirement to fund any deficit created in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

table of contents if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel  our ability to effectively manage and expand our business will be harmed 
our success largely depends on the skills  experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees who may terminate their employment at any time 
the loss of any of our senior management team could harm our business 
the announcement of the loss of one of our key employees could negatively affect our stock price 
our ability to retain our skilled workforce and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future 
we face challenges in hiring  training  managing and retaining employees in certain areas including metallurgical researchers  equipment technicians  and sales and marketing staff 
if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled employees  our new product and alloy development and commercialization could be delayed  and our marketing and sales efforts could be hindered  which would adversely impact our competitiveness and financial results 
the risks inherent in our international operations may adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from operations in international markets 
as we continue to expand internationally  we will need to hire  train and retain qualified personnel for our direct sales efforts and retain distributors and train their personnel in countries where language  cultural or regulatory impediments may exist 
we cannot ensure that distributors  regulators or other government agencies will continue to accept our products  services and business practices 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on the international market 
the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders  as well as the purchase of raw materials from international sources  subject us to the trade regulations of various jurisdictions 
compliance with such regulations is costly 
any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties  including imprisonment of individuals  fines and penalties  denial of export privileges  seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities 
failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping  sales and service activities 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions  including our ability to obtain  and the costs associated with obtaining  us export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals  changes in duties and tariffs  taxes  trade restrictions  license obligations and other non tariff barriers to trade  burdens of complying with the foreign corrupt practices act and a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  business practices or laws favoring local companies  fluctuations in foreign currencies  restrictive trade policies of foreign governments  longer payment cycles and difficulties collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  difficulties in enforcing or defending agreements and intellectual property rights  and foreign political or economic conditions 
we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not harm our business 
any material decrease in our international revenues or inability to expand our international operations would adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents although a collective bargaining agreement is in place for certain employees  union or labor disputes could still disrupt the manufacturing process 
our operations rely heavily on our skilled employees 
any labor shortage  disruption or stoppage caused by any deterioration in employee relations or difficulties in the renegotiation of labor contracts could reduce our operating margins and income 
approximately percent of our us employees are affiliated with unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 
failure to negotiate new labor agreements when required could result in a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities 
although we believe that our labor relations have generally been satisfactory  it is possible that we could become subject to additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions  or that work stoppages or other labor disturbances could occur in the future  any of which could reduce our operating margins and income and place us at a disadvantage relative to non union competitors 
product liability and product warranty risks could adversely affect our operating results 
we produce many critical products for commercial and military aircraft and for land based gas turbines 
failure of our products could give rise to substantial product liability and other damage claims 
we maintain insurance addressing this risk  but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us 
additionally  we manufacture our products to strict contractually established specifications using complex manufacturing processes 
if we fail to meet the contractual requirements for a part  we may be subject to warranty costs to repair or replace the product itself and additional costs related to the investigation and inspection of non complying products 
these costs are generally not insured 
risks related to shares of our common stock our stock price is subject to fluctuations as a result of being traded on a public exchange which may not be related to our performance 
the stock market has been highly volatile 
as a result  the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile  and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed elsewhere in this risk factors section and others such as fluctuations in the market price of nickel  raw materials or energy  market conditions in the end markets into which our customers sell their products  principally aerospace  power generation and chemical processing  announcements of technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us  announcements by us of acquisitions  alliances  joint development efforts or corporate partnerships in the high temperature resistant alloy and corrosion resistant alloy markets  market conditions in the technology  manufacturing or other growth sectors  and rumors relating to us or our competitors 
payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance 
although our board of directors currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock  the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the 
table of contents board s assessment of our operations  financial condition  projected liabilities  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends at the same or similar rates 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as delaware statutes  may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
these provisions  including those regulating the nomination of directors  may make it more difficult for other persons  without the approval of our board of directors  to launch takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest 
these provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

item legal proceedings the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
future developments and increasingly stringent regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures for these matters 
the company is regularly involved in litigation  both as a plaintiff and as a defendant  relating to its business and operations 
such litigation includes federal and state eeoc administrative actions and litigation and administrative actions relating to environmental matters 
for more information see item business environmental matters 
litigation and administrative actions may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources  and the level of future expenditures for legal matters cannot be determined with any degree of certainty 
nonetheless  based on the facts presently known  management does not believe that expenditures for legal proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company is currently  and has in the past  been subject to claims involving personal injuries allegedly relating to its products 
for example  the company is presently involved in two actions involving welding rod related injuries  both of which were filed against numerous manufacturers  including the company  in december in the us district court eastern division and february in california state court  respectively  alleging that the welding related products of the defendant manufacturers harmed the users of such products through the inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese 
the company believes that it has defenses to these allegations and  that if the company were found liable  the cases would not have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition to these cases  the company has in the past been named a defendant in several other lawsuits  including filed in the state of california  alleging that its welding related products harmed the users of such products through the inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese 
the company has since been voluntarily dismissed from all of these lawsuits on the basis of the release and discharge of claims contained in the confirmation order issued in connection with the company s emergence from chapter reorganization 
while the company contests such lawsuits vigorously  and may have applicable insurance  there are several 
table of contents risks and uncertainties that may affect its liability for claims relating to exposure to welding fumes and manganese 
for instance  in recent cases  at least two courts in cases not involving haynes have refused to dismiss claims relating to inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese based upon a bankruptcy discharge order 
although the company believes the facts of these cases are distinguishable from the facts of its cases  it cannot assure you that any or all claims against the company will be dismissed based upon the confirmation order  particularly claims premised  in part or in full  upon actual or alleged exposure on or after the date of the confirmation order 
it is also possible that the company will be named in additional suits alleging welding rod injuries 
should such litigation occur  it is possible that the aggregate claims for damages  if the company is found liable  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

significant events of fiscal regular quarterly cash dividend on november   the company announced that the board of directors has initiated a regular quarterly cash dividend of per outstanding share of the company s common stock 
the first dividend paid by the company was on december  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december   the first business day of december 
the december dividend cash pay out was based on current shares outstanding and equaled approximately million 
subsequently  there were cash dividend payments on march   june  and september  the total authorized cash dividends paid for fiscal was approximately million 
new bargaining unit agreement on july   the company announced that the membership of the united steelworkers local usw ratified an agreement covering approximately employees at the company s kokomo  indiana plant and the lebanon  indiana service center 
the new three year agreement included a lump sum payout of four thousand dollars for covered employees and wage increases of  and in  and this agreement succeeds an existing agreement that expired june  the one time lump sum payment total of million including employer taxes was paid in july and will be expensed on a straight line basis over the three year life of the contract as the payment allows for a lower wage increase over the term of the agreement 
improved results net income for fiscal is million  a substantial improvement over the fiscal net loss of million 
the net loss in fiscal included a write off of goodwill of million 
the company s improved results from fiscal to fiscal were due to a combination of a modestly improving market environment  improved product mix  high cost raw material from inventory which impacted cost of goods 
table of contents sold in fiscal having no impact in fiscal  and an improved cost structure including staffing reductions during fiscal and operating efficiencies attributable to equipment upgrades 
capital spending as announced at the beginning of fiscal  the company plans to spend  in total  approximately million over fiscal years through on capital projects 
this amount includes approximately million on upgrades to its four high steckel rolling mill and supporting equipment  approximately million on other equipment purchases and upgrades and approximately million on routine capital maintenance projects 
in addition  the company is finalizing plans to spend approximately million over the course of fiscal and to restructure  consolidate and enhance capabilities at its service center operations to improve the return on assets at those operations 
management does not anticipate prolonged equipment outages as a result of upgrades for any of these projects 
these projects are expected to improve quality  improve inventory turnover  reduce operating costs  improve delivery performance and decrease cycle time 
capital spending in fiscal was million  compared to an original target of approximately million  excluding any spending for service center restructuring 
the difference of million between the original forecast and the actual amount spent includes million related to the timing of completion of a project for the company s four high steckel rolling mill that was started in fiscal  but which will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal the target for capital spending in fiscal is approximately million  plus additional amounts for the restructuring of the company s service centers 
management estimates that spending on the service center project will be approximately million over the course of fiscal and dividends declared on november   the company announced that the board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per outstanding share of the company s common stock 
the dividend is payable december  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  the aggregate cash payout based on current shares outstanding will be approximately million  or approximately million on an annualized basis 
outlook general net revenues  volume and net income improved during each quarter of fiscal when compared to the immediately preceding quarter 
management expects this trend to continue into fiscal due to moderate improvement in demand in the company s end markets and improving global economic conditions 
management expects that the company s operating results will continue to be negatively impacted by reduced absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to less than optimal production volumes  and by competition from stainless manufacturers who are trying to fill increased capacity  which may impose continued downward pressure on prices 
these negative factors are expected to be somewhat offset by the benefit of the cost savings initiatives undertaken in fiscal and and increased efficiencies and equipment reliability resulting from the company s capital improvement program 
although management expects continued improvement in forward performance for fiscal compared to fiscal  net revenues  volume and net income in the first quarter of fiscal should approximate the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to the impact of fewer ship days  customer shutdowns and major maintenance projects to be undertaken by the company in the first quarter 
management also expects that demand for the company s products will continue to increase as market conditions improve  resulting in increased levels of net revenues  volume and net income in the second quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents working capital controllable working capital  which includes accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses  increased during fiscal accounts receivable increased during fiscal due to increased sales and an almost three day improvement in days sales outstanding 
inventory increased significantly during the fiscal year primarily due to staging of work in process inventory for initiation of the inventory pull process  staging of inventory as safety stock for customers in the event of a work stoppage associated with the collective bargaining agreement negotiation and increased sales volumes 
the process of reducing inventory started in july and management expects that during fiscal inventory turns will improve quarter over quarter 
although inventory was reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the reduction was lower than management s original expectation 
the initiation and operation of the pull inventory process is more complex than originally considered  in particular due to increased order entry 
progress is being made  but management expects that the benefits from the inventory pull process will not be seen in full until the end of fiscal as a result of these factors  the cash balance at september  was million 
backlog as a result of increasing order entry  backlog dollars were approximately million at september   an increase of approximately from approximately million at june  this increase is the result of a increase in backlog average selling price and a increase in backlog pounds 
in addition  backlog in all four of the company s primary markets was higher at september  than at september  management expects backlog dollars and pounds to continue to increase through fiscal competition and pricing although volumes and pricing continued to improve through the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company continued to experience intense price competition in the marketplace  particularly in mill direct project business 
this competition continues to require the company to aggressively price project business orders  which has unfavorably impacted the company s gross profit margin and net income 
however  it appears that the impact of the price competition lessened in the second half of fiscal  which is reflected in the improved product pricing in the fourth quarter of fiscal average selling price increased between the first quarter and the fourth quarter of fiscal this increase reflects both a higher priced mix of alloys and forms and a modest improvement in demand in the company s end markets 
current selling prices continue to be impacted by both the competitive environment and the volatility of raw material in the market place  which will continue to temper prices 
if market conditions continue to improve  pricing competition in the high performance alloy industry may begin to ease further in future quarters 
the company continues to respond to this competition by increasing emphasis on service centers  offering value added services  improving its cost structure  and focusing on delivery times and reliability

service center transactional business volumes and prices have improved  particularly in the aerospace market  due to significant destocking by the company s customers in this market during the last two years 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal  cost of goods sold per pound has improved as a result of i a significant reduction in the amount of higher cost raw material from inventory  which negatively impacted cost of goods sold in much of fiscal  ii manufacturing staff reductions in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  iii operating efficiencies attributable to equipment upgrades  particularly in the sheet finishing operations  and iv continued implementation of lean manufacturing techniques

total product price per pound excludes other revenue 

table of contents aerospace sales increased throughout fiscal the increased sales appear to be largely due to the end of a destocking process that occurred in this market in fiscal and based on the company s current backlog and rate of order entry  management anticipates that aerospace sales will continue to improve in fiscal this belief is further supported by sizable backlogs at boeing and airbus  including production schedules which will drive sales starting in mid  and a strong showing for new plane orders at the farnborough airshow 
management anticipates that the maintenance  repair and overhaul business will continue at a steady pace due to required maintenance schedules for engines currently in use 
sales to the chemical processing industry decreased year over year  primarily as a result of the economic slowdown which impacted volume and price 
pounds shipped to the chemical processing market in fiscal fluctuated quarter to quarter as a result of sporadic project business 
management believes the reduced sales in fiscal compared to prior periods reflect the historical trend of decreases in the company s chemical processing market sales when there are global economic concerns 
however  based on our order entry and backlog balance  it is anticipated that sales to the chemical processing industry will improve in fiscal compared to fiscal the improved level of activity is further supported by an increase in forecasted global spending in the chemical processing sector 
sales to the land based gas turbine market in fiscal decreased by approximately from the previous year 
based on the company s backlog and order entry rate  it is anticipated that volumes for fiscal will improve from fiscal  although the amount of the improvement is uncertain 
subject to global economic conditions  management believes that long term demand after calendar in this market will show improvement due to higher activity in power generation  oil and gas production  and alternative power systems 
land based gas turbines are favored in electric generating facilities due to low capital cost at installation  flexibility in use of alternative fuels and fewer so emissions than the traditional fossil fuel fired facilities 
sales into the other market category increased year over year by driven by a volume increase of 
the industries in this category focus on upgrading overall quality  improving product performance through increased efficiency  prolonging product life  and lowering long term costs 
companies in these industries are looking to achieve these goals through the use of advanced materials which supports the increased use of high performance alloys in an expanding number of applications 
in addition to supporting and expanding the traditional businesses of flue gas desulphurization  automotive  oil and gas and heat treating  the company expects increased levels of activity in non traditional markets such as solar  nuclear and silicon feed stock production applications 
based on our backlog balance and order entry activity  it is anticipated that the company will experience a level of revenue activity for this category in excess of fiscal

table of contents inflation while neither inflation nor deflation has had  nor do we expect them to have  a material impact on our operating results  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future 
historically  the company has had the ability to pass on to customers both increases in consumable costs and material costs because of the value added contribution the material makes to the final product 
raw material comprises the most significant portion of the product costs 
nickel  cobalt and molybdenum  the primary raw materials used to manufacture the company s products  all have experienced significant fluctuations in price 
in the future the company may not be able to successfully offset rapid increases in the price of nickel or other raw materials

critical accounting policies and estimates overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  asset impairments  retirement benefits  matters related to product liability lawsuits and environmental matters 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  pension asset mix and  in some cases  actuarial techniques  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this process form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company routinely reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
the following listing of policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when collectability is reasonably assured and when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment fob shipping point or at a foreign port for certain export customers 
allowances for sales returns are recorded as a component of net revenues in the periods in which the related sales are recognized 
management determines this allowance based on historical experience 
should returns increase above historical experience  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents pension and postretirement benefits the company has defined benefit pension and postretirement plans covering most of its current and former employees 
significant elements in determining the assets or liabilities and related income or expense for these plans are the expected return on plan assets if any  the discount rate used to value future payment streams  expected trends in health care costs  and other actuarial assumptions 
annually  the company evaluates the significant assumptions to be used to value its pension and postretirement plan assets and liabilities based on current market conditions and expectations of future costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be required in future periods 
the company believes the expected rate of return on plan assets of is a reasonable assumption on a long term perspective based on its asset allocation of equity  fixed income and other 
the company s assumption for expected rate of return for plan assets as of september  for equity  fixed income  and real estate other are  and  respectively 
this position is supported through a review of investment criteria and consideration of historical returns over a several year period 
in the short term  substantial decreases in plan assets will result in higher plan funding contribution levels and higher pension expenses 
a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase in annual pension expense of about  to the extent that the actual return on plan assets during the year exceeds or falls short of the assumed long term rate of return  an asset gain or loss is created 
gains and losses are generally amortized over a year period 
as an example  each million in asset loss created by unfavorable investment performance results in seven annual payments contributions of approximately  depending upon the precise effective interest rate in the valuation and the timing of the contribution 
salaried employees hired after december  and hourly employees hired after june  are not covered by the pension plan  however  they are eligible for an enhanced matching program of the defined contribution plan k 
effective december   the us pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for all non union employees in the us effective september   the us pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for employees in the plan 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the company reviewed goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the weakening of the us economy and the global credit crisis resulted in a reduction of the company s market capitalization below its total shareholder s equity value for a sustained period of time  which is an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
as a result  the company performed an interim stepone goodwill impairment analysis as of february  which indicated impairment 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash charge of  for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of fiscal accordingly  no goodwill impairment analysis was required for the year ending september  the company reviews trademarks for impairment annually or more often if necessary and concluded no impairment adjustment was necessary
