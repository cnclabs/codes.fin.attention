table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide information that is supplemental to  and should be read together with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
information in this item is intended to assist the reader in obtaining an understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  the primary factors that accounted for those changes  any known trends or uncertainties that we are aware of that may have a material effect on our future performance  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  this item provides information about our business segments and how the results of those segments impact our financial condition and results of operation as a whole 
executive summary we have four major product categories graphite electrodes  refractory products  advanced graphite materials  and natural graphite products 
reportable segments 
our businesses are reported in the following categories industrial materials  which consists of graphite electrodes and refractory products 
engineered solutions  which includes advanced graphite materials and natural graphite products 
reference is made to the information under part i for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
our discussions about market data and global economic conditions below are based on or derived from published industry accounts and statistics 
outlook 
based on current international monetary fund imf projections and other global economic forecasts  world output is projected to rise in in both advanced and emerging economies  although to varying degrees 
imf notes that the recovery in advanced economies is anticipated to be weak by past standards while emerging economies are poised for a quicker and stronger recovery given robust internal demand 
while recovery has begun in certain regions  electric arc furnace steel end market demand is anticipated to remain below pre crisis levels 
as a result  graphite electrode industry recovery is anticipated to be slow as operating rates remain subdued as compared to historical standards 
weak end market demand remains a risk to price realization as we work to complete our graphite electrode order book 
we expect results to benefit from improved volumes in our graphite electrode business 
however this favorable impact from increased volumes will be partially offset by significantly higher raw material costs 
given the fragile state of economic recovery  limited customer visibility and shift in customer order patterns to shorter term contracts  our ability to project full year detailed guidance is limited 
we expect that the first quarter will be our weakest quarter of the year with operating income targeted to be in the range of million to million 
a marginal improvement to earnings is anticipated in subsequent quarters  driven by a slight increase in industrial material volumes and the expectation that our engineered solutions segment begins to recover in the second half of in  we are targeting overhead expense to be in the range of million to million  capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million  depreciation expense to be approximately million and the effective tax rate to be in the range of percent to percent 
our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  factors described under item a risk factors and item a forward looking statements in this report 

table of contents financing transactions on february   we completed a substantial amendment and restatement of our credit agreement to effect a refinancing of the revolving facility 
we believe the refinancing enhanced liquidity 
the revolving facility now provides for loans and letters of credit in a maximum amount outstanding at any time of up to million and matures in july we are currently negotiating a new facility 
based on our credit ratings and current financial condition  we have no reason to believe that we will not be able to obtain a replacement working capital facility 
we can have outstanding letters of credit of up to million under the revolving facility 
at december   we had no borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of million under this revolving facility 
we have a million letter of credit facility with another commercial bank under which we had outstanding letters of credit of million at december  we also have approximately million of working capital liquidity available to use through our factoring and supply chain arrangements currently in place 
during  we redeemed million of the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes due  at of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
we also converted to equity the million principal amount of our convertible senior debentures for  shares of our common stock and million in cash  million of which represented the present value of all remaining scheduled interest payments from the date of derecognition until january  a million gain was recognized at conversion 
on september   we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding senior notes  million  at plus accrued interest 
total cash paid to redeem the balance of the senior notes approximated million 
during  we entered into a supply chain financing arrangement  as discussed in more detail under liquidity and capital resources  below 
our purchases of inventory under this arrangement were million in and million in we sell accounts receivable without recourse 
we sold million and million of receivables in and  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
proceedings against us we are involved in various other investigations  lawsuits  claims  demands  environmental compliance programs  and other legal proceedings arising out of or incidental to the conduct of our business 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these matters and proceedings  we do not believe that their ultimate disposition will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
realizability of net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december  we had million of gross deferred income tax assets  of which million required a valuation allowance 
in addition  we had million of gross deferred income tax liabilities 
our valuation allowance means that we do not believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized 
until we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets  income tax benefits in each current period will be fully reserved 
our valuation allowance  which is predominately in the us tax jurisdiction  does not affect our ability and intent to utilize the deferred income tax assets as we generate sufficient future profitability 
we are executing current strategies and developing future strategies  to improve sales  reduce costs and improve our capital structure in order to improve us taxable income of the appropriate character to a level sufficient to fully realize these benefits in future years 
customer base we are a global company and sell our products in every major geographic market 
sales of these products to buyers outside the us accounted for about of net sales in and  and in in  six of our ten largest customers were based in europe  one in india  one in south america  one in the middle east and one in the us 
in  nine of our ten largest customers were purchasers of our industrial materials products 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in 
table of contents results of operations and segment review for most of companies across the world experienced the deepest global downturn in recent history 
we weathered the economic recession despite declines in shipments in both our industrial materials and engineered solutions segments 
we remained profitable by adjusting our production to meet customer orders and aggressively controlling costs 
we used existing supplies of raw materials which allowed us to conserve cash and reduce our debt 
in september signs of a slow recovery in the steel industry began to emerge 
government stimulus programs around the world resulted in modest growth in several economies resulting in our customers replenishing inventories in order to meet slightly higher utilization rates for steel production 
in the fourth quarter of customers restocked their depleted inventories of graphite electrodes in order to meet increasing demand 
the world steel association estimates that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  an decrease compared to china  which accounted for of the total  decreased compared to non chinese steel production rose from an average of about million tons per month in the first few months of to about million tons per month by the end of while production levels rose in the last half of compared to the first half  they are not yet at the levels of the first half of we believe that the worldwide total graphite electrode manufacturing capacity for was million metric tons and that the graphite electrode industry manufacturing capacity utilization rate worldwide was approximately for demand for our engineered solutions products decreased in as a result of the global recession 
we experienced lower sales volume across multiple product lines 
we expect our engineered solutions segment to begin to recover in the second half of global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in the first half of in september it became apparent that the global economy was entering into difficult times due to the financial industry crisis 
credit markets became frozen  liquidity diminished  business activity slowed at an extreme pace leading the global economy into its worst crisis in years 
due to the negative global economic situation and falling steel demand from key steel end markets automotive  construction  and appliances  a significant number of global steel producers reduced their operating rates in the fourth quarter 
we believe that in the graphite electrode markets in which we compete  the capacity utilization rate was over for the first nine months of due to the financial crisis and the global economic slowdown  however  operating rates fell dramatically in the fourth quarter of to an average of and were estimated to be approximately at year end the world steel association estimated that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about a decrease as compared to china s steel production grew at a much lower rate than in recent years due to a slowdown in economic growth and falling steel demand 
in  china s steel production grew by about  a significant decline compared to china s recent double digit annual growth rates 
steel production in the rest of the world declined by in the percent of eaf to total steel production remained at approximately in eaf steel production was estimated to have been million metric tons in  about a decrease compared to for the first nine months of the year  eaf production grew by over  but eaf experienced a decline of in the fourth quarter 
china s eaf steel production increased compared to the prior year 
the rest of the world s eaf production declined by  as a result of lower operating rates in the fourth quarter 
demand for our engineered solutions segment increased in as compared to the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  oil and gas exploration  transportation industries  and etm markets 
overall  global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about a increase over in  china s production grew almost and represented the 
table of contents single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
chinese steel production was basic oxygen furnace related in china remained the growth leader for new eaf steel production 
overall  eaf steel production capacity continued to grow in  primarily driven by new eaf furnaces in china  and to a lesser extent  in russia  the middle east and north america 
this contributed to a more favorable global pricing environment in we experienced a significant increase in demand for our engineered solutions products in the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  oil and gas exploration  transportation industries and markets for our natural graphite products

net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were in thousands  except change increase decrease change industrial materials engineered solutions total net sales 
table of contents the global recession resulted in significantly reduced sales for both operating segments 
we experienced reduced demand across all of our products lines as our customers  especially those in the industrial materials segment  used existing inventory in response to their decreased orders and production 
in the fourth quarter demand and shipments began to increase as customers began restocking their inventories in response to increasing orders and production 
our analysis of the percentage change in net sales for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table volume price mix currency net change industrial materials engineered solutions the sales decline was partially offset by year over year price realization 
cost of sales 
the primary driver of the reduction in cost of sales was reduced shipments of our products 
the global recession led to a dramatic decline in the demand for  and corresponding production of  graphite electrodes 
our customers aggressively managed their working capital by destocking their graphite electrode inventory supply which exacerbated the reduced demand for electrodes 
cost of sales was also negatively impacted due to the unfavorable fixed cost absorption associated with lower sales volume 
needle coke is the primary raw material in the manufacture of graphite electrodes 
we usually purchase to of our needle coke requirements from one supplier under contracts with one year fixed price per metric ton schedules 
our purchases of needle coke in were limited and abnormally low due to the lower production level of graphite electrodes 
due to the historically low production volumes  and proactive inventory management  essentially all of our production was produced with needle cost that was in inventory at december   and carried the purchase price per metric ton 
during the fourth quarter of we began to replenish our needle coke raw material inventory at the purchase price per metric ton  which was approximately higher than the purchase price per metric ton 
as of december  essentially all of this higher cost material was still in inventory and  therefore  our cost of goods sold does not reflect the impact of the increased needle coke per metric ton cost 
for needle coke purchases  we have completed the negotiations with our largest supplier and the cost per metric ton is essentially flat with the cost per metric ton 
as we start our production in we will begin to use the higher cost needle coke purchased in the fourth quarter of and will have to replenish the needle coke raw material inventory at the purchase price per metric ton 
the inventory flow through of the higher cost raw material will significantly increase our cost of goods sold in when compared to our ability to pass this increased cost to customers depends to a large extent on the strength of the global economic recovery and our customers ability to increase prices for their products 
selling and administrative expenses 
lower sales commissions as a result of decreased sales and aggressive cost control contributed to the decrease in selling and administrative expenses 
the derecognition of our liability for brazilian excise taxes on manufactured goods resulted in a benefit of million and our stock based compensation expense decreased million 
equity in losses and write down of investment in non consolidated affiliate 
we acquired our investment in the non consolidated affiliate on june  our equity in losses for the year were million compared to in the increased losses were due in part to our recognizing our share of the investee losses for a full year as well as the effect of the recession on its operations 
in june  we performed an assessment of our investment for impairment and determined that the fair value of the investment was less than our carrying value and that the loss in value was other than temporary 
we recorded a million noncash impairment to recognize this other than temporary loss in value 
in 
table of contents december  we had recorded a million noncash impairment to recognize the other than temporary loss in value determined at that time 
given the current economic environment and the uncertainties surrounding the impact on steel producers and their suppliers  including our investee  there can be no assurances that our estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the investment will prove to be accurate 
if the assumptions regarding forecasted revenue  growth rates  and expected profitability are not achieved  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
other income expense 
other expense decreased in due in large part to the expenses that were recognized in for the derecognition of the debentures and the loss on extinguishment of debt 
in we had other expense related to currency compared to income related to currency in interest expense 
interest expense decreased in as a result of the derecognition of the debentures in and the redemption of all of the remaining outstanding senior notes in the third quarter of segment operating income 
corporate expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s percentage of consolidated sales 
the following table represents our operating income by segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands industrial materials engineered solutions total segment operating income the percentage relationship of operating expenses  including restructuring and impairment charges  to sales for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table operating expenses percentage of sales change industrial materials engineered solutions provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was negatively impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance of and the establishment of accruals for uncertain tax positions of million 
this increase was offset in part by a million worthless stock deduction and by million for tax exemptions  holidays and credits in various non us jurisdictions

table of contents net sales 
net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were in thousands  except change increase decrease change industrial materials engineered solutions total net sales net sales for our industrial materials segment increased  primarily due to favorable price mix increases in compared to steel producers are our primary customers for our products in the industrial products segment 
the economic crisis caused decreases in worldwide steel production in both the third and fourth quarters of this decreased demand in the second half of  which was exacerbated by our customers using inventory on hand for their production requirements  offset the favorable demand we experienced in the first half of the year 
as a result  volumes for our industrial products segment decreased slightly in compared to net sales for our engineered solutions increased  due to price mix increases  favorable volumes  and favorable currency impacts in compared to sales for our etm products and sales to the solar industry were particularly strong in compared to our analysis of the percentage change in net sales for the industrial materials and engineered solutions segments follows volume price mix currency net change industrial materials engineered solutions cost of sales increased primarily due to higher raw materials costs in our industrial materials segment  and increased production costs related to higher sales volumes in our engineered solutions segment 
these increases were offset by a decrease due to reduced period costs associated with the exit of the carbon electrode business and a decrease in volumes for our graphite electrode products 
research and development expenses increased due primarily to increased employee compensation costs 
selling and administrative expenses increased due to an increase in bad debt expense of million during the year and million of increased severance costs 
stock based compensation expense increased million 
these increases were somewhat offset by savings realized from our global cost savings initiatives 
equity in losses and write down of investment in non consolidated affiliate increased due to our recognizing a million write down  net of our equity in losses  related to our investment in a non consolidated affiliate 
interest expense decreased as a result of debt and interest rate reductions 
other expense was million in  compared to income of million in excluding gains from the sales of assets in  which primarily related to the sale of our caserta  italy facility  other expense in was million 
during  we had a million expense for the make whole payment and a gain of million in connection with the derecognition of our debentures 
as a result of factoring a higher number of receivables in  the loss on the sale of accounts receivable increased by million in compared to during  we sold certain litigation rights and investments which resulted in income of million which did not recur in these items were offset slightly by a million decrease in the loss on extinguishment of debt in  and a million favorable currency impact year over year 
in  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million  comprised primarily of a million charge associated with the phase out of our graphite 
table of contents electrode machining and warehousing operations in clarksville  tennessee and a million associated with changes in estimates related to the timing and amounts of severance and related payments to certain employees in caserta  italy 
in  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million related to severance and related costs associated with our switzerland facility 
segment operating income 
corporate expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s percentage of consolidated sales 
the following table represents our operating income by segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands industrial materials engineered solutions total segment operating income our analysis of the percentage change in segment operating expenses  including restructuring and impairment charges for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table operating expenses change percentage of sales industrial materials engineered solutions segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales for industrial materials decreased points to in however  total operating expenses on an absolute basis increased million compared to this increase was the result of higher raw material costs of million  related to our graphite electrode products  offset by volume decreases which had a favorable impact on operating income of million 
million of this volume decrease was related to our carbon electrodes business  which we completely exited during other operating expenses for the segment increased by million in compared to  due to increases in selling and allocated corporate expenses  which were offset by lower employee incentive plan costs and lower restructuring charges in segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales for engineered solutions decreased points to in however  total operating costs of million in increased million from operating costs of in this increase was due to a million unfavorable currency impact  caused by the strengthening us dollar year over year  a million increase related to sales volumes  million of higher production costs as a result of increased raw material costs 
selling  general  and administrative cost  including corporate expenses  and other production costs decreased million in compared to due to the continued application of our global cost cutting initiative 
effects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the six us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
see currency translation and transactions for a further discussion of highly inflationary countries 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
currency translation and transactions we translate the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes in accordance with fasb asc  foreign currency matters 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders equity and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
we account for our russian and mexican subsidiaries using the dollar as the functional currency  as 
table of contents sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
our remaining subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses  including those from non permanent intercompany loans  as part of other income expense  net 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates and results of operations 
effects of changes in currency exchange rates when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the us dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the us dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic and political changes  which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income 
during  the average exchange rate for the brazilian real and the euro increased about and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for during  the south african rand decreased about  and the mexican peso decreased about compared to the rates 
during  the average rate of the south african rand did not fluctuate materially  while the mexican peso  the brazilian real  and the euro average rates decrease about   and respectively as compared to rates 
for net sales of industrial materials  the impact of these events was an increase of about million in  an increase of million in  and a decrease of million in for the cost of industrial materials  the impact of these events was an increase of about million in  an increase of million in  and an increase of million in we have had intercompany term loans between graftech finance and some of our foreign subsidiaries 
we had no such term loans at december  at december   the aggregate principal amount of these term loans was million 
these loans were subject to remeasurement gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
certain of these loans had been deemed to be essentially permanent prior to settlement and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining balance of these loans was deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans were recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
as part of our cash management  we also have intercompany loans between our subsidiaries 
these loans are deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
we had net total of currency gains of million in and million in  while we had a net total currency loss of million in  mainly due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and the effect of transaction gains and losses on intercompany activities 
we have in the past and may in the future use various financial instruments to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources global capital markets have been  and continue to be  disrupted and volatile 
the cost and availability of funding has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets 
we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet all of our present needs subject to our need to refinance our revolving facility prior to its scheduled expiration on july  continued turbulence in the us and international financial markets  however  could adversely affect the cost and availability of financing to us in the future 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  long term debt of million and stockholders equity of million 
we also have approximately million of working capital liquidity available to us through our factoring and supply chain financing arrangements and million available through our revolving facility currently in place as described below 
as part of our cash management activities  we manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable vendor terms to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
we expend capital to support our operating and strategic plans 
such expenditures include investments to meet regulatory and environmental requirements  maintain capital assets  develop new products or improve existing products  and to enhance capacity or productivity 
many of the associated projects have long lead times and require commitments in advance of actual spending 
we are targeting capital expenditures to be in the million to million range for our sources of funds have consisted principally of cash flow from operations and debt  including our revolving facility  and equity financings 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of capital expenditures  our equity investment in a non consolidated affiliate  payment of pension and post retirement contributions  debt reduction payments and other obligations 
as of december   we have several future obligations accrued that will utilize a significant amount of such funds 
these obligations include our employee incentive compensation payout of approximately million  which will be paid during the second quarter of we also plan to contribute million to our pension plans during we have an accounts receivable factoring arrangement in place that provides additional working capital liquidity of up to million 
during and  certain subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million and million  respectively 
proceeds of the sale of receivables were used to reduce debt and fund operations 
if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable would have been about million higher at december  and million higher at december  all such receivables sold during and were sold without recourse  and no amount of accounts receivable sold are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
lower sales volumes for our products and reduced credit quality of our customers may limit the amount of receivables that we sell in the future 
our current receivable sales facility provides for the sale of certain customer accounts receivable and has a limit of million 
the facility automatically renewed for a one year period on june   and it automatically renews each year thereafter for one year periods unless a termination notice is sent by either party days prior to the applicable june th 
during  we entered into a supply chain financing arrangement with a financing party that provides additional working capital liquidity of up to million 
under this arrangement  we essentially assigned our rights to purchase needle coke from our supplier to the financing party 
the financing party purchases the product from our supplier under the standard payment terms and then immediately resells it to us under longer payment terms 
the financing party pays the supplier the purchase price for the product and then we pay the financing party 
our payment for this needle coke will include a mark up the mark up 
the mark up is subject to quarterly reviews 
in effect  we have a longer period of time to pay the financing party than by purchasing directly from the supplier which helps us maintain a balanced cash conversion cycle between inventory payments and the collection of receivables 
we purchased approximately million and million of inventory under this arrangement in and  respectively 
in connection with these purchases  we 
table of contents incurred a mark up of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
this agreement is subject to termination days after notice is sent by either party 
in the event that operating cash flow  the sales of receivables and the financing of needle coke purchases fail to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business needs  including capital expenditures  any such shortfall would be made up by increased borrowings under our revolving facility 
we use cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  funds from receivable and payable factoring arrangements and funds available under the revolving facility subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the revolving facility as well as cash on hand as our primary sources of liquidity 
the revolving facility is secured  and provides for maximum borrowings of up to million and  subject to certain conditions including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  an accordion feature that permits graftech finance to establish additional credit facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount  together with the revolving facility  of up to million 
the revolving facility matures in july we are currently negotiating with banks for a replacement facility 
based on our credit ratings and current financial condition  we have no reason to believe that we will not be able to obtain a replacement working capital facility 
if we are  however  unable to refinance our revolving facility  or are able to renew it only in a significantly lesser amount  or otherwise on less favorable terms  it may i adversely impact our growth and acquisition initiatives  ii impair our ability to purchase raw materials  and iii have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
at december   there were no borrowings drawn from the revolving facility  and million was available after consideration of outstanding letters of credit of million 
it is possible that our future ability to borrow under the revolving facility may effectively be less because of the impact of additional borrowings upon our compliance with the maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratio permitted or minimum interest coverage ratio required under the revolving facility 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the revolving facility  as applicable 
these covenants include maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of based on a rolling average of the prior four quarters 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with these covenants through maturity of the facility 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with these covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
eleven banks are participants in our credit facility 
all of these eleven banks currently have standard poor s s p ratings of a or better and moody s ratings of ba or better 
based on these ratings and the remaining term of the revolving facility  we do not anticipate that our availability under this facility would be reduced prior to its maturity 
at december   approximately of our debt consists of fixed rate obligations compared to at december  as of december   we had a corporate s p rating of bb and a moody s rating of ba on january   s p upgraded our corporate rating by two notches to bb and our senior unsecured debt rating to bbb 
these ratings reflect the current views of these rating agencies  and no assurance can be given that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
however  we monitor our financial condition as well as market conditions that could ultimately affect our credit ratings

our foreign subsidiaries have local lines of credit for working capital purposes 
the total amount available under these lines of credit approximated million at december  cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
our business strategies include efforts to enhance our capital structure by further reducing our gross obligations 
our efforts include leveraging our global manufacturing network by driving higher utilization rates and more productivity from our existing assets  accelerating commercialization initiatives across all of our businesses and realizing other global efficiencies 
typically  our cash flow from operations fluctuates significantly between quarters due to various factors 
these factors include customer order patterns  fluctuations in working capital requirements  and other factors 
in  and  we had positive cash flow from operations primarily from improved operating results in and and aggressive working capital management in certain of our obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations services payment of our obligations  including our incentive compensation program payout in the second quarter of  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
although we currently have no borrowings drawn under the revolving facility  continued improvement  or another downturn  in the global economy may require increased borrowings under our revolving facility  particularly if our accounts receivable and supply chain financing arrangements are terminated 
an improving economy  while resulting in improved results of operations and cash flows  could require significant cash requirements to purchase inventories and pay other obligations as accounts receivable increase 
a downturn could significantly negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows  which  coupled with increased borrowings  could negatively impact our credit ratings  our ability to comply with debt covenants  our 
table of contents ability to secure additional financing and the cost of such financing  if available 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with our existing financial covenants in  however  we cannot predict whether additional or more restrictive covenants  if any  may result from a new credit arrangement or our ability to comply therewith 
in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduce our sales of  or refuse to sell except for cash on delivery or under letters of credit  our products to some customers and potential customers 
in the current economic environment  our customers may experience liquidity shortages or difficulties in obtaining credit  including letters of credit 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide have not been material during the last years individually or in the aggregate 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
in addition  we have historically factored a portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce debt 
our ability to factor accounts receivable in the future may be limited by reduced credit ratings of customers or by a reduction in the amount permitted to be financed under the arrangement 
in december  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
share repurchases may take place from time to time in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions  as market conditions warrant 
we intend to fund any such share repurchases from available cash and cash flows 
these share repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
related party transactions

we agreed to loan up to million and on july   we loaned seadrift million as did the other shareholders in the aggregate 
borrowings under these agreements are evidenced by senior subordinated non negotiable demand notes that are subordinate to seadrift s revolving credit agreement 
the demand notes cannot be repaid until all indebtedness under seadrift s revolving credit agreement have been paid in full and the obligation to make any further loans or advances have ceased and terminated 
the demand notes bear interest at  payable quarterly in arrears commencing september  seadrift also paid a servicing fee to each lender at the time of a borrowing 
we have not engaged in or been a party to any other material transactions with affiliates or related parties except for transactions with our current or former subsidiaries and compensatory transactions with directors and officers including employee benefits  stock option and restricted stock grants  compensation deferral  executive employee loans and stock purchases

table of contents cash flows 
the following is a discussion of our cash flow activities years ended december  dollars in millions cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents cash receipts and cash disbursements related to all our activities other than to investing and financing activities 
operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net income for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  write down of our investment in our non consolidated affiliate  stock based compensation charges  equity in losses of our non consolidated affiliate gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of assets and currency gains and losses changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations while our operating cash flow increased significantly in  it decreased by over million in mainly due to the decrease in net income which was a direct impact of the severe economic recession and other reasons noted throughout this md a 
this is evident as the net income adjusted for non cash operating items amounted to million in  million in  and million in these amounts exclude the loss from discontinued operations in and the changes in operating assets and liabilities discussed below 
the net impact of the changes in working capital operating assets and liabilities  which are discussed in more detail below  include the impact of changes in receivables  inventories  prepaid expenses  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  interest payable  and payments of other current liabilities 
we continue to maximize our operating cash flows by continuing to improve those working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume  such as accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable

costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill  our investment in a non consolidated affiliate and other intangible assets  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts  including inventory valuations 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our 
table of contents assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit and defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
excluding the defined contribution plans  accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss is significantly different from the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as incurred 
investments in non consolidated affiliates 
we use the equity method to account for investments in entities that we do not control  but where we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
we assess the potential impairment of our equity method investments when indicators such as a history of operating losses  negative earnings and cash flow outlook  and the financial condition and prospects for the investee s business segment might indicate a loss in value 
we determine fair value based on valuation methodologies  as appropriate  including the present value of our estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value is less than our carrying amount  the investment is determined to be impaired 
if the decline in value is other than temporary  we record an appropriate write down 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of the future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over our current technology  significant negative economic or industry trends  changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets  and future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include within the consolidated balance sheets  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 

table of contents if our estimates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  title has passed  the amount is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
sales are recognized when both title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer or services have been rendered and fees have been earned in accordance with the contract 
volume discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in conjunction with the sale of the related products 
changes to estimates are recorded when they become probable 
shipping and handling revenues relating to products sold are included as an increase to revenue 
shipping and handling costs related to products sold are included as an increase to cost of sales 
stock based compensation plans 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair market value of the award and recognized over the requisite service period 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on the trading price of our common stock on the date of grant  less required adjustments to reflect dividends paid and expected forfeitures or cancellations of awards throughout the vesting period  which ranges between one and three years 
our stock option compensation expense calculated under the fair value method  using a black scholes model  is recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period 
recent accounting pronouncements we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note  new accounting standards of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
description of our financing structure we discuss our financing structure in more detail in note  long term debt and liquidity  of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commercial energy rates 
we  from time to time  routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage these well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties  if any  to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk  despite the current worldwide economic situation 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long term debt tied to libor or euro libor 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  and investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than the dollar 
our exposure to changes in energy costs results primarily from the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
interest rate risk management 
we periodically implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
we periodically enter into agreements with financial institutions that are intended to limit  or cap  our exposure to incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure 

table of contents currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency instruments from time to time to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency instruments  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to non dollar denominated debt and identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
the outstanding contracts at december  and represented an unrealized gain of million and an unrealized loss of million  respectively 
commercial energy rate management 
we periodically enter into natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
the outstanding contracts at december  and represented unrealized losses of million and an unrealized gain of million  respectively 
sensitivity analysis 
we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates on gross margin and changes in interest rates on interest expense 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by approximately million 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would not have increased our interest expense significantly for the year ended december
