executive summary during fiscal  our consolidated sales were million  an increase of million or from fiscal this increase primarily reflects the following the impact from the first full year of satcon product sales  additional shipments for numerous military defense programs including rcied radio controlled improvised explosive devices jammer systems  and offset by soft market conditions for substantially all of our commercial markets 
in  our total sales to military defense customers amounted to million  an increase of million or from sales to commercial customers were million in fiscal  down from million or from the prior year  primarily reflecting the impact of the global recession 
in fiscal  our gross margin was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales  reflects reductions in material and direct labor costs from changes in sales mix and the impact of leveraging fixed manufacturing overhead with higher production volumes 
selling  general and administrative expense was million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in this increase primarily reflects additions to incentive based compensation  legal settlement expenses  equity based compensation  and employee relocation expenses 
other nonoperating income  net of other expenses  decreased  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease principally was driven by reductions in patent licensing fees and investment income 
overall  we generated net income of million or cents per share cents diluted in fiscal  compared to net income of million or cents per share cents diluted in fiscal during the year ended november   net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million 
this positive cash flow  along with our existing cash reserves  enabled us to expend million on capital equipment additions  repay million in bank indebtedness  as well as support the million aggregate cash purchase price for micro networks 
at november   our cash and cash equivalents were million  our current ratio was to  and our total debt to equity was to

offsetting much of this sales growth in fiscal was the global recession and its impact throughout most of our commercial markets 
sales of our microwave components and systems were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal satcon product shipments increased in fiscal to million  up million from fiscal year  representing satcon s first full year of sales 
in addition  shipments of microwave products used in numerous military defense applications increased in fiscal  including microwave components and assemblies used in rcied jammer systems 
these rcied programs remain active  with orders and shipments for system upgrades expected to continue throughout fiscal total customer orders received for our microwave components and systems were million in fiscal  versus million in fiscal sales of our advanced specialty products were million in fiscal  down million or from a year ago 
in  sales of these products to customers in our commercial markets were down by approximately million 
the soft commercial sales were partially offset by an increase of million of shipments in support of various military defense programs 
total customer orders received for this business segment totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for our sensors and controls  sales for fiscal were million  down million or from a year ago 
shipments of these products used in military defense applications including aircraft cockpit controls and fin actuators  fighting vehicles  and smart weapons increased million in  while product shipments into commercial markets decreased by million 
in fiscal  demand for our temperature sensors and thermal products which are used in various commercial food service applications  refrigeration  and hvac equipment was particularly soft 
customer orders received for our sensors and controls amounted to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal for our power management systems  sales for fiscal were million and customer orders received amounted to million  up and from a year ago  respectively 
in fiscal  shipments for these products were particularly strong in electronic data storage and applications for our ac power strip products 
total customer orders received in fiscal amounted to million  a decrease of million from the preceding year 
at november   our sales order backlog was million  up million from the end of fiscal this increase reflects million of sales order backlog assumed as part of our acquisition of micro networks 
overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable in for all of our major product lines 
gross margin in fiscal  our gross margin was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales  principally reflects changes in sales mix and better absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead with higher production volumes 
total material costs amounted to million or of sales in fiscal  versus million or of sales in the preceding year 
direct labor costs were million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in the decreases in direct material and direct labor costs  as a percentage of sales  were driven primarily by changes in sales mix 
manufacturing overhead costs amounted to million or of sales in  versus million or of sales in the preceding year 
in fiscal  the increase in manufacturing overhead primarily reflects additional costs for employee health insurance  which was partially offset by numerous cost reduction programs 
at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  including micro networks employees  which represents a reduction of from the end of last fiscal year 
we expect to continuously review our organization and cost structure to enhance operating efficiencies  while maintaining flexibility for additional production requirements 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the increase in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  primarily reflects an increase to our effective sales commission rate from changes in sales mix 
aggregate general and administrative expense was million in  versus million in the increase in general and administrative expense includes  of additional incentive based compensation expense   of expenses resulting from a legal settlement  as well as several other operating expense increases from additional business activity 
interest expense with lower interest rates and reduced short term borrowings  our interest expense decreased in the current year 
total interest expense in fiscal was  a decrease of  from fiscal during the year ended november   weighted average borrowings under our domestic line of credit amounted to million  with an average interest rate of 
during the year ended november   weighted average borrowings under the domestic line of credit were million  with an average interest rate of 
other income and expense we hold certain united states and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer pml technology  and we have granted several licenses to other entities for the use of pml technology 
in connection with our pml technology  we received license fee and royalty income of  in no license fees or royalty income were earned or received in in addition  with substantially all of the pml related patents having expired or about to expire  we believe that the pml licenses that we have granted have little or no remaining commercial value 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency 
as a result  we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign currency transaction net losses of  in and  in were recognized and included in nonoperating income and expense 
we realized interest income of  in and  in from temporary cash investments 
the decrease in interest income primarily reflects reductions in money market interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
for the years ended november  and  the difference between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate principally reflects state tax provisions  research activities tax credits  and us domestic production activities deductions 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  compared to net sales our consolidated net sales were million in fiscal  a decrease of million or from fiscal this decrease primarily reflects reduced shipment levels in support of rcied jammer system programs 
in addition  our sales were negatively impacted by soft market conditions in certain sectors of the telecom equipment industry 
sales of our advanced specialty products were million in fiscal  down million or from the preceding year 
approximately million of this decrease relates to reduced shipments in support of rcied jammer systems  with the remaining shortfall reflecting certain sluggish telecom equipment markets 
total customer orders received for this business segment totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal sales of our microwave components and systems were million in fiscal  down million or from fiscal microwave assemblies shipped in fiscal under rcied jammer system programs were approximately million less than fiscal shipment levels 
in fiscal  the decrease in shipments supporting these jammer systems was partially offset by million of satcon product sales and increased microwave product shipments under numerous other military defense programs 
total customer orders received for our microwave components and systems were million in fiscal  versus million in fiscal sales and customer order rates for our other two business segments increased during fiscal for our power management systems  sales for fiscal were million and customer orders received amounted to million  up and from the preceding year  respectively 
in fiscal  shipments for these advanced systems were particularly strong in applications for data storage  networking systems  and various military communication equipment 
for our sensors and controls  sales in fiscal were million and customer orders received amounted to million  an increase from fiscal of and respectively 
demand for our custom position sensors which are used in various medical equipment  commercial weather instruments  and military aircraft and vehicles was particularly strong throughout fiscal total customer orders received in fiscal amounted to million  an increase of million from the preceding year 
at november   our sales order backlog was million  up million from the end of fiscal of this increase  million reflects the sales order backlog assumed as part of our acquisition of satcon 
overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable in for all of our major product lines 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross margin in fiscal  our gross margin was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal in addition to the impact of reduced sales volume  the decrease in gross margin primarily reflects higher manufacturing overhead costs 
total material costs amounted to million or of sales in fiscal  versus million or of sales last year 
the decrease in material costs principally reflects reduced ceramic component costs  with our ceramic manufacturing operations in state college  pennsylvania  improving product yields  achieving and maintaining full production  and thereby totally eliminating the need to purchase higher priced third party ceramics 
direct labor costs were million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in the increase in direct labor costs was driven by changes in sales mix  as well as the full resumption of internal ceramic manufacturing 
manufacturing overhead costs amounted to million or of sales in  versus million or of sales in the preceding year 
this million increase in manufacturing overhead reflects higher personnel costs  greater depreciation expense  and increases to certain inventory reserves because of lower than expected operating requirements 
at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  down from the end of the preceding fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the increase in selling expense primarily reflects additional travel expense  as well as increases to our effective sales commission rate 
aggregate general and administrative expense was million in  versus million in the increase in general and administrative expense includes  of additional equity based compensation expense   of added legal and professional fees  as well as numerous other operating expense increases 
interest expense with lower interest rates and reduced short term borrowings  our interest expense decreased in total interest expense in fiscal was  a decrease of  from fiscal during the year ended november   weighted average borrowings under our domestic line of credit amounted to million  with an average interest rate of

for the year ended november   the difference between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily reflects state tax provisions  foreign income tax rates  and changes in estimated tax rates applied to temporary differences 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets 
based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future table income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we maintain a domestic line of credit with our principal lending institution  pnc bank  na of erie  pennsylvania the bank  in the aggregate amount of million  with an additional million expansion feature 
borrowings under the line of credit are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property  and bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate 
at november   million was outstanding under this line of credit arrangement 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability  and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness 
at november   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
the current line of credit agreement expires in december our ability to borrow in the future under this bank credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants 
whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future  for which there can be no assurance 
our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains an unsecured euro line of credit with a german financial institution aggregating approximately million euro million 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
future borrowings  if any  will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand 
in fiscal  our net working capital and current ratio increased slightly  primarily reflecting reduced borrowings under our domestic line of credit and increased inventories from our acquisition of micro networks 
at november  and  net working capital was million and million  respectively 
at november   our current assets were times current liabilities  compared to at the end of fiscal our net working capital was million at november  and our current ratio was to at the end of fiscal the reduction in our working capital and current ratio in reflects the impact of borrowing under our domestic line of credit to partially fund our stock repurchase program and the cash purchase price for the acquisition of satcon 
in fiscal year  we expended million for capital additions and improvements  including million in our microwave components and systems business to increase manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies 
the remainder of our capital expenditures principally consists of normal replacements and enhancements of manufacturing equipment 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  including million in our microwave components and systems business and million in our advanced specialty products business 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to production capacity and other manufacturing enhancements 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  including million for the acquisition of a machining center used in our sensors and controls business 
the balance of our capital expenditures primarily relate to manufacturing capacity expansion and building improvements at our state college operations 
we conduct our operations in numerous locations  including a leased facility in marlborough  massachusetts the marlborough facility and an owned facility in wesson  mississippi the wesson facility 
in  the marlborough facility sustained wind damage to its roof which  in turn  resulted in water damage to certain machinery  equipment  and leasehold improvements 
also in  a small outbuilding at the wesson facility sustained a fire  destroying the outbuilding and certain plating equipment contained inside 
upon the settlement of all related insurance claims  we received insurance recoveries of million for the fixed assets damaged or destroyed by these involuntary conversions 
at november   we had not entered into any material commitments for additional capital expenditures 
we currently expect our aggregate capital expenditures in fiscal to approximate our fiscal levels 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of micro networks 
the aggregate cash purchase price for micro networks was million  which was primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit 
in september  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of satcon 
the net cash purchase price for satcon was million  which was substantially funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit 
in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of emf 
the net cash purchase price for emf was million  which was primarily funded by existing cash reserves 
we have adopted a stock repurchase program 
under this program  we may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices 
funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the company s capital structure  liquidity  and the market price of the company s common stock 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
during the year ended november   we did not repurchase any of our common stock 
in  we repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
no shares were repurchased in fiscal since the inception of the stock repurchase program   shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes  amounted to million in  million in  and million in we expect to continue our investment in research and development in  as we continuously enhance existing product lines  design new products and processes  and increase our participation in emerging markets 
income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november    and amounted to million  million  and million  respectively 
as a result of certain temporary differences and prepayments  we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be less than income tax expense for fiscal as of november   our obligations and firm commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases current financial resources  including working capital and existing lines of credit  and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year  including scheduled long term debt repayment  lease commitments  planned capital expenditures  research and development expenses  and possible stock repurchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in this increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects improved accounts receivable and inventory turnover rates  as well as other reductions in working capital requirements 
in  our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by a million growth in inventories  principally reflecting replenishment of ceramic component safety stocks and additional work in process inventories in support of our increased sales order backlog 
primarily driven by our enhanced profitability  net cash provided by operating activities grew to million in fiscal during the year ended november   accounts receivable and inventory turnover rates decreased slightly 
at november   goodwill represented of our total assets and of our stockholders equity 
in addition to a total of million of goodwill recognized in connection with our recent acquisitions of micro networks  satcon  and emf  another million of goodwill was realized in earlier acquisitions 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  we have performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of september of each fiscal year and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended november    and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and other local currencies 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos and chinese yuan 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to the euro and british pound sterling  we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
at november   we did not have any forward currency exchange contracts outstanding 
for each of the three years ended november   currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions  and we have never experienced nonperformance by any counterparties to these agreements 
at november   no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued environmental matters we own certain land and manufacturing facilities in state college  pennsylvania 
the property  which was acquired from murata electronics north america murata in december  consists of approximately acres of land and  square feet of manufacturing facilities 
among other uses  the acquired facilities have become the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic operations  replacing the ceramic operations previously conducted in new orleans  louisiana 
the purchase price for the acquired property consisted of a  plus b closing costs of  including realtor commissions  transfer taxes  and legal fees  plus c the assumption of  and indemnification of murata against  all environmental liabilities related to the property 
the acquired property has known environmental conditions that require remediation  and certain hazardous materials previously used on the property have migrated into neighboring third party areas 
these environmental issues arose from the use of chlorinated organic solvents including tetrachloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce 
as a condition to the purchase  we entered into an agreement with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep pursuant to which a we agreed to remediate all known environmental conditions relating to the property to a specified industrial standard  with our costs for remediating such conditions being capped at million  b padep released murata from further claims by pennsylvania under specified state laws for the known environmental conditions  and c we purchased an insurance policy providing clean up cost cap coverage for known and unknown pollutants with a combined coverage limit of approximately million  and pollution legal liability coverage for possible third party claims with an aggregate coverage limit of million 
the total premium cost for the insurance policy  which has a ten year term and an aggregate deductible of  was million 
the cost of the insurance associated with the environmental clean up million is being charged to general and administrative expense in direct proportion to the actual remediation costs incurred 
the cost of the insurance associated with the pollution legal liability coverage million is being charged to general and administrative expense on a pro rata basis over the ten year policy term 
based upon our environmental review of the property  we recorded a liability of million to cover probable future environmental expenditures related to the remediation  the cost of which is expected to be entirely covered by the insurance policy 
as of november   remediation expenditures of million have been incurred and charged against the environmental liability  with all such expenditures being reimbursed by the insurance carrier 
the remaining aggregate undiscounted expenditures of million  which are anticipated to be incurred over the next six years  principally consist of a continued operation and monitoring of the existing on site groundwater extraction  treatment  and recharge system  b completion of soil investigations to determine the extent of potential soil contamination  c excavation and off site disposal of soil containing contaminates above acceptable standards  and d implementation of soil vapor extraction systems in certain areas 
depending upon the results of future environmental testing and remediation actions  it is possible that the ultimate costs incurred could exceed the current aggregate estimate of million 
we expect such increase  if any  to be entirely covered by the insurance policy 
insurance recoveries for actual environmental remediation costs incurred are recorded when it is probable that such insurance reimbursement will be received and the related amounts are determinable 
such insurance recoveries are credited to the company s general and administrative expense 
based on the current remediation plan   of the total remediation costs are expected to be incurred during the next twelve months 
we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries 
us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations 
in addition to these federal agencies  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of our continuing environmental program  we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any significant legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
other legal matters we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
recent accounting pronouncements asc  business combinations in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc  business combinations 
the objective of this new accounting guidance is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
specifically  it establishes principles and requirements over how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain price  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
asc changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items  including acquisition related costs and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition 
this new accounting guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company s fiscal year  with early adoption prohibited 
once adopted  we believe asc will have an impact on accounting for business combinations  but the effect is dependent upon the nature and terms of the acquisitions made at that time 
asc  intangibles other than goodwill subsequent remeasurements in april  the fasb issued asc  intangibles other than goodwill subsequent remeasurements  which amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
these provisions apply to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of assets and intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions 
furthermore  these provisions remove the provision that requires an entity to consider whether the renewal or extension can be accomplished without substantial cost or material modifications of the existing terms and conditions associated with the asset 
instead  these provisions require that an entity consider its own experience in renewing similar arrangements 
an entity would consider market participant assumptions regarding renewal if no such relevant experience exists 
this new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the company s fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of this new accounting guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
asc  business combinations recognition of identifiable assets and liabilities and any noncontrolling interests in april  the fasb issued asc  business combinations recognition of identifiable assets and liabilities and any noncontrolling interests  which applies to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies that would be within the scope of asc  contingencies  if not acquired or assumed in a business combination  except for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies that are subject to specific guidance in asc  business combinations 
these provisions require an acquirer to recognize at fair value  at the acquisition date  an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period 
if the acquisition date fair value cannot be determined during the measurement period  the asset or liability shall be recognized at the acquisition date if it is probable that the asset existed or that a liability has been incurred at the acquisition date and the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated 
these provisions are effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company s fiscal year 
once adopted  we believe that this new accounting guidance will have an impact on accounting for business combinations  but the effect is dependent upon the nature and terms of the acquisitions made at that time 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued asc  subsequent events in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events 
the objective of these provisions are to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the provisions discuss two types of subsequent events events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet  and is recognized in the financial statements and events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued  and not recognized at the balance sheet date 
an entity shall also disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated  as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued 
the requirements are effective for interim and annual financial periods ending after june  the requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluated our november  consolidated financial statements for subsequent events through february   the date the consolidated financial statements were issued 
we are not aware of any subsequent events which would require recognition or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements 
asu  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles in june  the fasb issued asu  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asu  which amends fas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles fas no 

fas no 
identified the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in preparing the financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
it arranged these sources of gaap in a hierarchy for users to apply accordingly 
with asu in effect  all of its content carry the same level of authority  effectively superseding fas no 
thus  the gaap hierarchy has been modified to include only two levels of gaap authoritative and nonauthoritative 
asu is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the provisions of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customer s financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due 
at november   our allowance for doubtful accounts was  or approximately of our aggregate accounts receivable 
in determining the adequacy of this allowance  we have assumed that conditions in our major served markets military defense  communications equipment  and medical industrial instrumentation will not significantly deteriorate during fiscal if current economic and market conditions do significantly deteriorate  our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us 
accordingly  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
at november   we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of  for excess and slow moving items 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage 
should these forecasts and estimates change due to market  technological or other factors  the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units  which we have identified as our operating segments  and is tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors  including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows 
goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach  in accordance with accounting standards codification asc no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
the determination of an impairment requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit  which we estimate using the discounted cash flow model and market approach 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions  including forecasted operating results and discount rates 
inherent in the forecasted operating results are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  projected cost saving initiatives  and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of september of each year 
for each of the fiscal years presented herein  no impairments were identified 
no reporting units were deemed to be at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test under asc no 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of possible impairment exist 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying values 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
however  our future cash flow expectations assume that the general economic climate and conditions within our major served markets will improve within the next few years 
if long term market conditions do not improve  or in fact deteriorate  our long lived assets may become materially impaired 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
presently  we believe that all deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is not required 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed 
these adjustments  when made  may have a materially negative impact on our consolidated financial statements
