sunopta inc december  k the md a detailed below is presented in five parts critical accounting estimates  results of operations for versus and versus  recent accounting developments  liquidity and capital resources  business and financial outlook and risks and uncertainties 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our december  consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
dollar amounts in this md a are presented in thousands of us dollars  unless otherwise notes 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most important to our business 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product or service and when all of the following have occurred a sales agreement is in place  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
consideration given to customers such as value incentives  rebates  early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to revenues at the time of sale 
in the sunopta bioprocess segment  the percentage of completion method is used to account for significant contracts 
the amounts of revenue and profit recognized each year are based on either the ratio of hours incurred to the total expected hours or costs incurred to the total expected costs 
costs incurred on long term contracts include labor  material  other direct costs and overheads 
losses  if any  on long term contracts are recognized during the period they are determined 
total expected hours on a project are based on our estimates during the progression of a project  including meeting specific criteria under the contract  testing during certain phases  and ensuring overall functionality 
we update the total expected hours to be incurred as new information becomes known 
significant differences between actual and the estimated hours to complete a project could result in changes in the amount of revenues recorded and their related costs being realized  which could also impact gross margins in a particular period 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from our customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to us 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is our largest current asset 
our inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a weighted average cost basis  or estimated net realizable value except certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory when provisions to record inventory at market are necessary 
in order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date  we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory 
the factors include the age of inventory  the amount of inventory held by type  future demand for products and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory 
our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time  using available information  expected business plans and expected market conditions 
we perform a review of our inventory by reporting unit and product line on a quarterly basis 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in inventory reserve 
sunopta inc december  k prepaid and other current assets prepaid and other current assets include amounts paid in cash and recorded as a current asset prior to consumption 
the balance also includes advances to growers required to secure future delivery of product net of provisions 
an allowance against realizing these advances is recorded when it is determined that we will not recover the advances  due to default on scheduled repayment terms  or general economic or market conditions 
advances to growers are typically made at the start of the growing season 
we monitor our advances to growers by monitoring adherence to agreed upon terms as well as evaluating general economic and market conditions  and assessing the status of the crops being grown in order to determine if the collection of the advance is at risk 
our judgment is required to assess whether allowances against growers advances are necessary including assessing the relationships with the growers and expected crop 
at the end of the growing season  we re evaluate any existing advances and provide fully for any advances relating to the previous season 
due to assumptions relating to the quality of the grower and expected crop additional provisions may be necessary compared to initial estimates 
impairment testing of goodwill with the implementation of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic formerly statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized  but instead are tested at least annually for impairment 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
in accordance with asc  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
to evaluate goodwill  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists 
we measure the fair value of reporting units using discounted cash flows 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the first year or base year in the calculation of the discounted cash flow model is based on actual results in each component  adjusted for unusual and non recurring items 
future years cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth  and our planned business strategies in future periods that would impact actual cash flows reported in the base year 
examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility  a reduction of working capital at a specific location  and price increases or cost reductions within business units 
the revenue growth and planned business strategies for future periods incorporated into the discounted cash flow model reflect our long term view of the market 
the discount rate is based on a segment s targeted weighted average cost of capital  which is not necessarily the same as our weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions are subject to change and are also impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions which may impact future results and result in projections not being attained 
each year we re evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
during the third quarter of  for opta minerals  we determined that there were external market conditions and other circumstances that suggested the carrying value of certain reporting units at opta minerals may exceed their fair values 
these external market conditions and other circumstances included continued operating losses and extended periods of facility under utilization due to continued weakness in the steel  foundry and abrasives markets 
based on the goodwill impairment test  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill at certain reporting units in opta minerals exceeded its fair value and  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of  to the consolidated statements of operations 
as part of the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter  we determined that the increase in goodwill as a result of contingent consideration in the fruit group resulted in the carrying value of the group exceeding its fair value 
as a result  we recorded a charge to the consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december   we determined that the carrying value of goodwill in the fruit group and part of the international sourcing and trading group exceeded its fair value and  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of  note of the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the critical assumptions used in the annual impairment test 
sunopta inc december  k purchase price allocation business acquisitions are accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired generally requires the most judgment  and include estimates of future profitability  and or customer and supplier based attrition  income tax rates and discount rates 
changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities could impact the amounts assigned to assets  liabilities and goodwill in the purchase price allocation 
future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an asset or goodwill impairment 
further  amortization periods are subjective based on expected useful lives and chosen rates 
note of the consolidated financial statements provide information with respect to businesses acquired and note outlines annual amortization expense relating to these intangibles 
accrued expenses and other assets we make estimates of future payments and receipts which relate to current and future accounting periods 
these estimates cover items such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses  estimates of taxes and estimates of amounts payable or receivable under legal suits 
in establishing appropriate accruals and receivable balances  we must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement or receipts that will ultimately be incurred or received 
in making such assessments  we use historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid or received could differ from our estimates 
income taxes we are liable for income taxes in the united states  canada  and other jurisdictions where we operate 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of numerous permanent differences  investment and other tax credits  the provision for income taxes at different rates in foreign and other provincial jurisdictions  enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the year  the benefit of cross jurisdictional financing structures  changes due to foreign exchange  changes in valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets  and favourable or unfavourable resolution of various tax examinations 
in making an estimate of our income tax liability  we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet 
we also estimate the amount of valuations allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
this judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts 
we assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied to  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgments had been used  our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of our deferred tax assets 
sunopta inc december  k in june  the fasb issued accounting standards codification asc topic formerly interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal  provincial  state and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
stock compensation we maintain a stock option plan under which incentive stock options may be granted to employees and non employee directors 
effective january   asc formerly sfas no 
r share based payments requires that we record stock based compensation expenses within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive earnings loss 
at each grant date  we are required to estimate a number of inputs  such as the estimated life of the option and the forfeiture rate used in the black scholes model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non employee directors 
once determined at the grant date  fair value of the stock award is recorded over the vesting period of the options granted

excluding unfavourable movements in foreign exchange  internal revenue decline was in revenues in sunopta foods decreased by  due in part to the impact of a weakened euro and canadian dollar on the revenues of the international sourcing and trading and the distribution group 
gross margins decreased  or  in to  from  in as a percentage of revenues  the consolidated gross margin rate increased to compared to in gross margin declined  in sunopta foods driven primarily by the distribution group wherein a decline in the value of the canadian dollar  the phasing out and re launch of branded natural health products  and higher inventory spoilage costs negatively impacted margins in the current year 
the international sourcing and trading group had lower gross margins over prior year due to lower demand 
these decreases were offset by improved gross margins in all other sunopta foods operating groups 
also contributing to the lower gross margin was a dramatic volume decline in the steel and foundry markets which impacted opta minerals in sunopta inc december  k warehouse and distribution w d costs for were  a decrease of  compared to the same period in the decrease is mainly attributed to the impact of a weaker canadian dollar on the translation of the distribution group s costs into us currency in addition to reduced variable costs on lower sales volume

these increases were also impacted by generally higher commodity prices

also unfavourably impacting the sunopta foods margin were higher sourcing  freight and storage costs as customer pricing often lagged cost increases and was further compounded by the depreciation in the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
plant throughput suffered as we strategically reduced production to reduce inventory levels 
higher inventory reserves and mark to market adjustments  especially in the fourth quarter  also contributed to the year over year reduction in gross margin rates

the statements in this outlook are forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements 
management believes that consumer demand for high quality natural and organic foods and natural health products has grown rapidly over the past decade as global awareness of the benefits of healthy eating continues to proliferate 
the global market for organic foods is currently estimated by management to be in excess of billion with historical growth rates between and depending on product line and country 
while growth rates slowed during the current economic downturn the long term trends for growth remain in place 
while a large number of companies compete within specific segments of the market  we believe there are relatively few companies as well positioned as sunopta to take advantage of this growing market 
we believe that our vertically integrated seed to table business model built over the past ten years has positioned sunopta as a global leader in the natural and organic foods and natural health products markets 
sunopta inc december  k for we expect to realize revenue and unit growth compared to  resulting from new product offerings  new and expanding customer relationships and expanded processing capabilities including our new soy processing and packaging operation in modesto  california which became operational in the second quarter of the incremental revenues are expected to be offset somewhat by reduced canadian and european revenues resulting from the decline in these currencies as compared to the us dollar and a decline in certain commodity prices which are ultimately reflected in selling prices 
we believe that customers will continue to focus on health conscious natural  organic and specialty foods and natural health products as concerns over disease  obesity and well being are center of mind and we feel sunopta is well positioned to meet the needs of these growing markets 
we expect that our net earnings for will improve versus as a result of improved volumes  pricing and product mix  the impact of capacity our expansion  cost reduction and rationalization initiatives  many of which have now been implemented  fixed cost leverage  and the avoidance of certain professional fees and severance costs incurred in which are not expected to reoccur in our primary focus for remains the improvement of operating margins and returns on assets employed 
as a direct result of continually changing world wide macroeconomic conditions  we have decided to take a cautious and responsible approach with regards to providing guidance  and in doing so  will not provide specific revenue and net earnings guidance at this time 
recent events are expected to delay  but not cease  our acquisition based growth strategy 
increased focus on margin improvement  improved internal controls and centralization of key services were key initiatives in and continue in management will continue to be heavily focused on executing working capital reductions  which is expected to increase available cash resources and alleviate some of the interest burden we incur on our existing debt facilities 
in  management added key experienced operational personnel in both the fruit group and at the corporate level to help drive these initiatives 
our overall strategy remains intact and the goal of profitable growth through an effective balance of internal growth and acquisitions in support of our vertically integrated seed to table strategy has not changed 
we continue to look for ways to improve the strategic synergies across our sunopta foods operations  vertically integrating wherever possible 
initiatives to improve the productivity of the operations include our performance excellent through people programs  product rationalization  plant and warehouse rationalization programs  continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement  supply chain and internal services programs and consolidated information and accounting systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making 
a more fulsome discussion of key strategies is included in item of this report 
maintaining liquidity and having available sources of cash will be imperative to continue our growth 
at december  we had  in cash  of which  may only be used within sunopta bioprocess and within opta minerals inc we also had approximately  in unused bank lines for a total of  in cash and borrowings available 
our remaining cash and unused lines plus cash generated from operations are sufficient to finance capital spending estimated at to million  annual debt service of  and payment of the remaining current portion of long term liabilities of additional sources of cash could be obtained through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing  a private or public offering  the issuance of shares or through a divestiture 
the  term loan within our syndicated banking facilities matures on december  and we expect to either re finance this debt with existing or new lenders  or settle the obligation using a combination of cash generated from operations and availability under other facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements there are currently no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition

also  in the event that a qualified initial public offering does not occur by june   the preferred shares issued in conjunction with the sunopta bioprocess private placement would represent a liability to bioprocess inc of  at that time 
b interest is calculated based on scheduled repayments over the periods as indicated  using existing interest rates at december  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  we may invest excess cash in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive earnings loss 
as at december  all of our excess funds were held in cash and cash equivalents with a maturity less than days 
debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have their fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer term debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter term securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at december   the weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate term debt was and   of our outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
at december   variable rate term debt of   carried a weighted average interest rate of 
we look at various factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates  including the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  our view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and our ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
for every increase decrease in interest rates our after tax earnings would increase decrease by approximately 
sunopta inc december  k opta minerals entered into a cash flow hedge in at inception  the fair value of the cash flow hedge was determined to be a loss of using mark to market valuations which required an immediate expense of the ineffective portion 
the cash flow hedge entered into exchanged a notional amount of cdn  us  from a floating rate to a fixed rate of from august to august the fair value of the hedging derivative is estimated based on the standard swap valuation methodology 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a loss of   resulting in a gain for the year  net of income taxes of loss of  net of an income tax recovery of 
foreign currency risk all of our us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency and the us dollar is also our reporting currency 
the functional currency of all our operations located in canada is the canadian dollar  except for sunopta bioprocess and opta minerals  where the functional currency is the us dollar 
the functional currency of all operations located in europe is the euro except for opta minerals where the functional currency is the us dollar 
for these operations  all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
the functional currency of the corporate head office is the us dollar 
for the corporate office transaction gains or losses as well as translation gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are recorded within foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive earnings loss 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of sunopta and its canadian and european subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
during  the canadian dollar appreciated significantly against the us dollar with closing rates moving from cdn at december  to cdn at december  for each us dollar 
during  the euro also appreciated against the us dollar with closing rates moving from at december  to at december  for each euro 
during  we had a decrease of cdn  an increase of cdn  in net canadian assets and an increase of  in net euro based assets 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favour of against the canadian dollar or euro with all other variables held constant would result in an increase decrease in the fair value of our net assets by   for a canadian dollar exchange movement and   for a euro exchange movement 
us based sunopta foods operations have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
the canadian based subsidiaries have significant transaction exposure as their sales are predominantly in canadian dollars while a substantial portion of their purchases are in u 
s dollars 
the european operations are also exposed to various currencies as they purchase product from a wide variety of countries in several currencies and primarily sell into the european market 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
open forward foreign exchange contracts were marked to market at december  resulting in a gain of a loss of  which is included in foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations 
the contracts entered into are primarily us dollars and euros 
the net effect of all exchange based transactions including realized foreign exchange contracts  unrealized open contracts and all other foreign exchange transactions including the translation gains and losses related to our corporate net monetary assets are recorded in foreign exchange on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of  commodity risk sunopta foods enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to our assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose us to risk in the event that a counter party to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
we manage risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved producers 
sunopta inc december  k we have a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the grain as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market as they do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
at december  we owned   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of and   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of 
at december   we had a net long position on soy beans of   and a net long short position on corn of   bushels 
an increase decrease in the commodity prices of either soy and corn of would result in an increase decrease in carrying value of these commodities by 
there are no futures contracts in the other sunopta foods segments  opta minerals  sunopta bioprocess or related to corporate office activities
