overview our company s history began in february as a private company operating in california 
now bionovo  inc is incorporated in the state of delaware and was made public through a reverse merger transaction between bionovo biopharmaceuticals  inc and lighten up enterprises international  inc on april  immediately following the reverse merger  the company operated as lighten up enterprises international  inc until june  when the company assumed the name  bionovo  inc on april   lighten up enterprises international  inc acquired all the outstanding shares of bionovo biopharmaceuticals  inc in exchange for  restricted shares of its common stock in a reverse triangular merger 
the acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger in which bionovo biopharmaceuticals  inc was deemed to be the accounting acquirer 
accordingly  the historical financial information presented herein is that of bionovo biopharmaceuticals  inc as adjusted for any difference in the par value of each entity s stock with an offset to capital in excess of par value 
financial information subsequent to the reverse merger is that of the merged entity  bionovo  inc business we are a clinical stage drug discovery and development company focusing on women s health and cancer  two large markets with significant unmet needs 
building on our understanding of the biology of menopause and cancer  we design new drugs derived from botanical sources which have novel mechanisms of action 
based on the results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies to date  we believe that we have discovered new classes of drug candidates with the potential to be leaders in their markets 
our lead drug candidate  menerba formerly mf  represents a new class of receptor sub type selective estrogen receptor modulator serm  for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms of menopause  or hot flashes 
we have designed menerba to selectively modulate estrogen receptor beta er and to provide a safe and effective alternative to existing fda approved therapies that pose a significant risk to women for developing breast cancer  stroke  cardiovascular disease  blood clots and other serious diseases 
in preclinical studies  menerba does not lead to tumor formation in either breast or uterine tissues and it does not increase the risk for clotting 
this activity  if confirmed in clinical testing  would differentiate menerba from some existing therapies and other therapies in clinical development 
we announced results in of our completed  multicenter  bionovo biopharmaceuticals  inc was originally formed as bionovo  inc and began operations in the state of california in february in march of  it reincorporated in the state of delaware and in june of changed its name from bionovo  inc to bionovo pharmaceuticals  inc lighten up enterprises international  inc was incorporated in nevada in january of 
table of contents randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled phase trial  involving women  which showed the higher of two menerba doses tested was well tolerated and resulted in a statistically significant reduction of hot flashes after weeks of treatment 
in addition  treatment with the higher dose of menerba lead to a statistically significant reduction in nighttime awakenings when compared to placebo  which represents superior efficacy to existing non hormonal therapies 
we are seeking fda approval to conduct further clinical testing at multiple clinical sites in the us we believe that menerba s novel mechanism of action could lead to a more favorable safety profile than currently approved hormone therapies ht and other therapies under development and testing 
we are also developing bezielle previously referred to as bzl  an oral anticancer agent for advanced breast cancer 
unlike most other anticancer drugs and drug candidates  which try to control cancer through genomic and proteomic signaling pathways  bezielle is designed to take advantage of the unique metabolism of cancer cells 
bezielle inhibits glycolysis  a metabolic pathway on which cancer cells rely 
glycolysis inhibition leads to dna damage and death of cancer cells without harm to normal cells 
we believe that bezielle may have a preferential effect on hormone independent cancers  a subset with few treatment options 
to date  women with metastatic breast cancer have been treated with bezielle in two separate phase clinical trials 
as predicted by the mechanism of action  bezielle had very limited toxicities with an extremely favorable tolerability profile 
moreover  bezielle showed encouraging clinical activity among a cohort of women with metastatic breast cancer who had been heavily pretreated with other regimens 
a phase trial has been approved by the fda and the irbs at several prestigious breast cancer clinical sites in the us bionovo is awaiting funding to commence this open label  non randomized trial in women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer who have failed no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens 
we plan to evaluate bezielle for the treatment of other forms of cancer  including pancreatic cancer and adjuvant use in breast cancer 
we have a diverse pipeline of additional preclinical drug candidates in both women s health and cancer  including our second women s health drug candidate  seala formerly referred to as vg  for the treatment of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy  or vaginal dryness 
we have identified or begun preclinical work on other drug candidates for a variety of indications within women s health and cancer 
we have internally discovered and developed all of our drug candidates using our proprietary biological and chemical techniques 
our drug development process targets herbs and other botanical sources  used in traditional chinese medicine  believed to produce biologically active compounds 
we apply our clinical knowledge  experience with natural compounds and knowledge of proper scientific screening tools to isolate and purify botanical compounds and extracts for pharmaceutical development 
in june  the fda released a document to provide drug developers with guidance on the approval for botanical drugs 
this guidance states that applicants may submit reduced documentation of nonclinical preclinical safety to support an ind application for initial clinical studies of botanicals 
the first botanical extract drug developed pursuant to these guidelines was approved by the fda in october to date  all of our drug candidates are derived from botanical extracts and are being developed in accordance with this fda guidance 
in addition  we have identified the active chemical components underpinning the mechanism of action for our novel drugs  and in some cases  we have developed synthetic methods of production 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future  and do not expect to generate profits until and unless our drug candidates have been approved and are being marketed with commercial partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
historically we have funded our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of our capital stock  equipment lease financings  license fees and interest earned on investments 
we will need to raise and are pursuing additional funds through grants  strategic collaborations  public or private equity or debt financing  or other funding sources 
this funding may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and may dilutive to shareholder interests 

table of contents development stage company we have not generated any significant revenue since inception 
the accompanying financial statements have  therefore  been prepared using the accounting formats prescribed for a development stage enterprise dse 
although the company has recognized some nominal amount of revenue  the company still believes it is devoting  substantially  all its efforts on developing the business and  therefore  still qualifies as a dse 
the company is primarily engaged in the development of pharmaceuticals  derived from botanical sources  to treat cancer and women s health 
the initial focus of the company s research and development efforts will be the generation of products for the treatment of breast and other cancers  and to alleviate the symptoms of menopause 
the production and marketing of the company s products and its ongoing research and development activities are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states 
prior to marketing in the united states  any drug developed by the company must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the food and drug administration fda under the food  drug and cosmetic act 
the company has limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical and clinical testing necessary to obtain regulatory approval 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter problems in clinical trials that will cause the company or the fda to delay or suspend clinical trials 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain patents and product license rights  maintain trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and other countries 
there can be no assurance that patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantage resulting in the company s transition from development stage enterprise reporting 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to clinical trial accruals  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  restructuring costs and share based compensation 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies related to revenue recognition  clinical trial accruals  share based compensation  income tax and research and development expenses to be the most critical accounting policies  because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived from collaborative research and development arrangements  technology licenses  and government grants 
revenue is recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met i a contractual agreement exists  ii transfer of technology has been completed or services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 

table of contents revenue from technology licenses or other payments under collaborative agreements where we have a continuing obligation to perform is recognized as revenue over the expected period of the continuing performance obligation 
revenue on government contracts is recognized on a qualified cost reimbursement basis 
accruals as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
share based compensation share based compensation to outside consultants is recorded at fair market value in general and administrative expense 
we record expenses relating to stock options granted to employees based on the fair value at the time of grant 
the fair value of stock options and warrants is calculated using the black scholes pricing method on the date of grant 
this option valuation model requires input of highly subjective assumptions 
because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in our management s opinion  the existing model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of fair value of our employee stock options 
in order to determine the fair value of our stock for periods prior to the date of our reverse merger transaction  we estimated the fair value per share by reviewing values of other development stage biopharmaceutical organizations  comparing products in development  status of clinical trials  and capital received from government and private organizations 
once a total value was determined  we then factored the number of shares outstanding  or possibly outstanding  resulting in an estimated value per share 
once we completed our reverse merger transaction on april   the trading price of our common stock was used 

table of contents for periods prior to our reverse merger transaction  we chose not to obtain contemporaneous valuations of our stock by any unrelated valuation specialist after realizing the cost of services would be substantial and that the benefit derived would not be substantially different from our estimate as we had used a multi tiered approach to estimate the value of our stock 
income tax we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and the california state jurisdiction 
to date  we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or any state income tax jurisdiction 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   there have been no interest or penalties charged to us in relation to the underpayment of income taxes 
we generated net losses since inception through the year ended december  and accordingly did not record a provision for federal income taxes 
deferred tax assets of million as of december  were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue to generate future taxable income to realize these tax assets  a full valuation allowance has been established to offset our deferred tax assets 
additionally  the future utilization of our nol carry forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future 
we have not yet determined whether such an ownership change has occurred 
if necessary  the deferred tax assets will be reduced by any carryforwards that expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations  with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
research and development activities research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  pre clinical and clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  share based compensation expense  supplies and materials  and facilities costs 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred research and development expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we continue our development of menerba  bezielle and other drug candidates 
most of our product development programs are at an early stage 
accordingly  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products 
completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 

table of contents product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at a reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect our product development efforts 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost or whether we will obtain any approval required by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
results of operations results of operations for the years ended december    and revenues years ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands nih grant licensing service revenue total revenues over the fiscal years  and consist primarily of licensing fees and proceeds from a us government grant 
total revenue in is greater than due to limited research services provided to one customer 
we expect to continue performing the research services into  however  the total revenue recognized is not expected to be significant to our operations 
while the national institute of health nih grant revenue was consistent in and  the grant is scheduled to expire in and we do not expect revenues from this grant to continue 
revenues were million in  compared to million in the million decrease in from was due to a decrease in proceeds from the nih grant activity and the termination of our licensing and technology transfer agreement with a taiwanese company in  which resulted in the recognition of million in revenue in from the remaining deferred revenue balance 
research and development expenses years ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands research and development expenses research and development r d expenses reflect costs for the development of drugs and include salaries  contractor and consultant fees and other support costs  including employee share based compensation expense 
r d expenses were million in compared with million in the increase of million is primarily due to increases in r d related depreciation  facilities and information technology charges combined with an increase in purchases of lab supplies and raw materials to support the menerba manufacturing process development  partially offset by decreases in our clinical trial expenses 
r d expenses were million in compared to million in the increase of million in from is due primarily to clinical trials expenses related to the development of our lead drug candidates 

table of contents general and administrative expenses years ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands general and administrative expense general and administrative g a expense includes personnel costs for finance  administration  information systems  and public relations related to our drug development and clinical trials  participation in conventions and tradeshows  website related expenses  facilities expenses  professional fees  legal expenses  and other administrative costs 
we do not currently have any dedicated sales support or personnel 
the million decrease in g a expenses in compared to was primarily due to decreases in g a related depreciation  facilities and information technology expenses caused by a decrease in the proportion of office to laboratory space as compared with our old location and the implementation of cost reduction initiatives to preserve our cash position 
the million increase in g a expenses in as compared to was primarily due to activities in support of our business including an increase in facility rental  legal expenses and an increase in payroll expenses related to an increase in g a management personnel 
interest income  interest expense and other expense years ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands interest income interest expense other expense  net total interest income is derived from cash balances and short term investments 
interest income was million in compared to million in and million in the decreases in both years reflect lower average cash balances 
we expect interest income to increase in due to our increase in cash balance from our financing transaction in october interest expense includes interest expense from capital lease agreements for our laboratory equipment and two notes payable to finance million of leasehold improvements made in the increase in other expense from to is due to approximately  in loss on fixed asset disposal primarily associated with the move to our new offices 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have incurred losses  and we have relied primarily on leasing and public and private financing to fund our operations 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at december  this increase in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments for the year ended december  is primarily due to million in net proceeds from our financing transaction in october partially offset by net cash used in operating activities of million for the twelve months ended december   million in expenditures for capital assets and patent costs  and million for payments on our capital lease agreements and notes payable 

table of contents net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due to million decrease in capital expenditures combined with million decrease in cash used in short term investment activities 
the decrease in capital expenditures in was primarily due to leasehold improvement expenditures in in preparation for the move to our new headquarters completed in january 
the decrease in net cash used in short term investing activities was due to lower cash and short term investment balances throughout as compared with net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared with net cash used by financing activities of million in due to our public offering completed on october  we did not have any equity financing transactions in registered public offering on october   we completed a registered public offering and issued  shares of our common stock and  warrants 
in addition  we granted the placement agent  warrants  each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock at per share at any time for a period commencing six months after the date of the closing  and continuing for five years following the closing date of the offering 
the warrants may also be executed on a cashless basis  in accordance with the terms of the warrant 
the offering resulted in gross proceeds of million and we received net proceeds of million after related issuance costs 
we will need to obtain substantial amounts of cash to achieve our objectives of internally developing drugs  which take many years and potentially significantly more amounts of cash to develop 
if we decide to market and commercialize any other drug candidate independently or with a partner  we may need to invest heavily in associated manufacturing  marketing and commercialization costs 
such costs will be substantial and some will need to be incurred prior to receiving marketing approval 
we do not currently have adequate internal liquidity to meet these objectives in the long term 
to do so  we will need to continue our partnering activities and look to other external sources of liquidity  including the public and private financial markets and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  working capital of million  and shareholders equity of million 
we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fully pursue our business plan before the end of if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our development programs 
we are currently pursuing a variety of funding options  including government grants  partnering co investment  venture debt and equity offerings 
the length of time that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and any available borrowings will sustain our operations will be based on  among other things  our prioritization decisions regarding funding for our programs  our progress in our clinical and earlier stage programs  the time and costs related to current and future clinical trials and regulatory decisions  our research  development  manufacturing and commercialization costs including personnel costs  the progress in our collaborations  costs associated with intellectual property  our capital expenditures  and costs associated with securing any future licensing opportunities 
based on the proceeds of our recent public offering  funding we expect to be available to us  and our ability to prioritize spending  we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our operating needs for at least the next months 
notes payable in connection with the move to our new headquarters  we financed leasehold improvements under two notes payable with the lessor of the building 
the first note of  bears interest at and is payable in 
table of contents monthly payments of interest and principal amounting to approximately  beginning may  and continuing over the remaining lease term with a due date of december  the second note of  bears interest at and is payable in monthly payments of interest and principal amounting to approximately  beginning august  the future minimum payments as of december  are as follows in thousands principal interest thereafter total minimum payments commitments and contingencies our contractual obligations and future minimum lease payments that are non cancelable at december  are disclosed in the following table in thousands

fasb asc topic does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
all existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the fasb codification will be considered non authoritative 
these provisions of fasb asc topic are effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  and  accordingly  are effective for the company for the current fiscal reporting period 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations  but will impact our financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre codification standards 
on its effective date  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards  and all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
in april of  the fasb issued guidance in the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants 
the guidance provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in relation to normal market 
table of contents activity 
in addition  when transactions or quoted prices are not considered orderly  adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be needed to determine the appropriate fair value 
the guidance is effective for interim or annual reporting periods ending after june   and shall be applied prospectively 
we adopted this guidance effective for the quarter ending june  and there is no impact of the adoption on our financial statements as of december  in april of  fasb issued guidance in the financial instruments topic of the codification on interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the guidance requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for both interim reporting periods  as well as annual reporting periods 
the guidance is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  and shall be applied prospectively

this guidance modifies the fair value requirements of asc subtopic revenue recognition multiple element arrangements by allowing the use of the best estimate of selling price for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
a vendor is now required to use its best estimate of the selling price when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling price cannot be determined 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted 
this guidance is effective in we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update on its consolidated financial statements 
in january of  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to the disclosures about an entity s use of fair value measurements 
among these amendments  entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about transfers into and out of the level fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and level fair value determined based on significant other observable inputs classifications  provide separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to the tabular reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the level fair value determined based on significant unobservable inputs classification and provide greater disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities that use fair value measurements 
except for the detailed level roll forward disclosures  the new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the requirement to provide detailed disclosures about the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than contractual obligations incurred in the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities  guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity

table of contents board of directors in december of accordingly  we have included an accrual of the related share based compensation expense in the financial statements as of december  of approximately million  which is the estimated fair value as of the reporting date 
in february of  we reached a settlement agreement with a former officer of the company who filed a complaint against bionovo  inc and two of its officers  alleging breach of contract resulting from the rescission of the former officer s employment agreement with the company in september the settlement amount is included as an expense accrual in our financial statements for the year ended december   however  the amount did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movement 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices intended to protect against these and other exposures 
as a result  we do not anticipate material potential losses in these areas 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and highly liquid short term investments 
our short term investments will likely decline by an immaterial amount if market interest rates increase and  therefore  we believe our exposure to interest rate changes is immaterial 
declines of interest rates over time will however  reduce our interest income from short term investments
