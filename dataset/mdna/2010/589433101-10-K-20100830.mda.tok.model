item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this form k  investors should consider carefully the following risk factors when investing in our securities 
in addition to the risks described below  there may be additional risks that we have not yet perceived or that we currently believe are immaterial 
advertising represents the largest portion of our revenues 
in fiscal  percent of our revenues were derived from advertising 
advertising constitutes about half of our national media revenues and almost all of our local media revenues 
demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the us economy 
during an economic downturn  demand for advertising may decrease 
the growth in alternative forms of media  for example the internet  has increased the competition for advertising dollars  which could in turn reduce expenditures for magazine and television advertising or suppress advertising rates 
circulation revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues 
magazine circulation is another significant source of revenue  representing percent of total revenues and percent of national media revenues 
preserving circulation is critical for maintaining advertising sales 
magazines face increasing competition from alternative forms of media and entertainment 
as a result  sales of magazines through subscriptions and at the newsstand could decline 
as publishers compete for subscribers  subscription prices could decrease and marketing expenditures may increase 
client relationships are important to our integrated marketing businesses 
our ability to maintain existing client relationships and generate new clients depends significantly on the quality of our services  our reputation  and the continuity of company and client personnel 
dissatisfaction with our services  damage to our reputation  or changes in key personnel could result in a loss of business 
paper and postage prices may be difficult to predict or control 
paper and postage represent significant components of our total cost to produce  distribute  and market our printed products 
in fiscal  these expenses accounted for percent of national media s operating costs 
paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to significant volatility 
all of our paper supply contracts currently pro vide for price adjustments based on prevailing market prices  however  we historically have been able to realize favorable paper pricing through volume discounts and multi year contracts 
the usps distributes substantially all of our magazines and many of our marketing materials 
postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the usps and on legislative mandates imposed upon the usps 
although we work with others in the industry and through trade organizations to encourage the usps to implement efficiencies that will minimize rate increases  we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude of future price changes for paper and postage 
further  we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers 
world events may result in unexpected adv erse operating results for our local media segment 
our local media results could be affected adversely by world events such as wars  political unrest  acts of terrorism  and natural disasters 
such events can result in significant declines in advertising revenues as the stations will not broadcast or will limit broadcasting of commercials during times of crisis 
in addition  our stations may have higher newsgathering costs related to coverage of the events 
our local media operations are subject to fcc regulation 
our broadcasting stations operate under licenses granted by the fcc 
the fcc regulates many aspects of television station operation s including employment practices  political advertising  indecency and obscenity  programming  signal carriage  and various technical matters 
violations of these regulations could result in penalties and fines 
changes in these regulations could impact the results of our operations 
the fcc also regulates the ownership of television stations 
changes in the ownership rules could affect our ability to consummate future transactions 
details regarding regulation and its impact on our local media operations are provided in item business beginning on page loss of affiliation agreements could adversely affect operating r esults for our local media segment 
our broadcast television station business owns and operates television stations 
six are affiliated with cbs  three with fox  two with mynetworktv  and one with nbc 
these television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming 
the non renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network 
this loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming  which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our audiences  resulting in reduced revenues 
we have two classes of stock with different voting rights 
we have two classes of stock common stock and class b stock 
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share and account for approximately percent of the voting power 
holders of class b stock are entitled to ten votes per share and account for the remaining percent of the voting power 
ther e are restrictions on who can own class b stock 
the majority of class b shares are held by members of meredith s founding family 
control by a limited number of individuals may make the company a less attractive takeover target  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
this voting control also prevents other shareholders from exercising significant influence over certain of the company s business decisions 
further non cash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is possible  depending upon future operating results and the value of the company s stock 
although the company wrote down certain of its intangible assets including goodwill by million in fiscal  further impairment charges are possible 
we test our goodwill and intangible assets  including fcc licenses  for impairment during the fourth quarter of every fiscal year and on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist 
factors which influence the evaluation include the company s stock price and expected future operating results 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is no longer deemed to be recoverable  a potentially material impairment charge could be incurred 
although these charges would be non cash in nature and would not affect the company s operations or cash flow  they would adversely affect stockholders equity and reported results of operations in the period charged 
acquisitions pose inherent financial and other risks and challenges 
on occasion  we will acquire another business as part of our strategic plan 
these transactions involve challenges and risks in negotiation  valuation  execution  and integration 
moreover  competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant  particularly in the field of interactive media 
even if successfully negotiated  closed  and integrated  certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets 
the preceding risk factors should not be construed as a complete list of factors that may affect our future operations and financial results
