item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic conditions in the united states have been challenging  including in the industries in which the company and congoleum conduct business 
the downturn in the housing industry has resulted in reduced demand for the company s and congoleum s products 
the slowdown in manufacturing  including in the automotive and industrial sectors  has resulted in reduced demand for the tape division s products 
in addition  the decline in consumer and retailer spending has resulted in reduced demand for k m s products 
forecasts generally call for a gradual economic recovery  with some risk of a double dip recession  in the united states  including in the industries in which the company and congoleum conduct business 
the company expects the current and forecasted economic con ditions to continue to negatively impact the company s and congoleum s businesses and operations and that the extent of that impact will depend on the speed  extent and sustainability of the global economic recovery 
in addition  raw material and energy costs have increased sharply in the past  particularly during the first half of  which has negatively impacted the company s and congoleum s businesses and operating results 
although raw material and energy costs have since declined  it is not known whether raw material and energy prices will remain lower or will revert to increasing price levels 
in light of the current and forecasted economic conditions in the united states and the industries in which the company and congoleum conduct business  the company and congoleum may be unable to pass increased raw material and energy costs on to their respective customers 
although the company and congoleum have recently implemented reductions in their expenses  there can be no assurance that they will be able to sustain those expense reductions 
american biltrite s consolidated financial statements include its majority owned subsidiary  congoleum 
however  under the terms of the fourth amended joint plan  abi s ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated 
abi expects its ownership interest in congoleum to be eliminated under any alternate plan or outcome in congoleum s chapter case 
congoleum is a defendant in a large number of asbestos related lawsuits 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum had obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of a proposed  pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
in january  congoleum filed its proposed plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
from that filing through  several subsequent plans were negotiated with representatives of the acc  the fcr and other asbestos claimant representatives 
in addition  two insurance compani es  together referred to as cna  filed a plan of reorganization and the bondholders committee also filed a plan of reorganization 
in may  the bankruptcy court ordered the principal parties in interest in congoleum s reorganization proceedings to participate in reorganization plan mediation discussions 
several mediation sessions took place during  culminating in two competing plans  one which congoleum filed jointly with the acc in september the tenth plan and the other filed by cna  both of which the bankruptcy court subsequently ruled were not confirmable as a matter of law 
in march  congoleum resumed global plan mediation discussions with the various parties seeking to resolve the issues raised in the bankruptcy court s ruling with respect to the tenth plan 
in july  the fcr filed a plan of reorganization and proposed disclosure statement 
after extensive further mediation sessions  in february  the fcr  the acc  the bondholders committee and congoleum jointly filed a plan of reorganization the joint plan 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement for the joint plan in february  and the joint plan was solicited in accordance with court approved voting procedures 
various objections to the joint plan were filed  and in may the bankruptcy court heard oral argument on summary judgment motions relating to certain of those objections 
in june  the bankruptcy court issu ed a ruling that the joint plan was not legally confirmable  and issued an order to show cause why the case should not be converted or dismissed pursuant to usc following a further hearing in june  the bankruptcy court issued an opinion that vacated the order to show cause and instructed the parties to submit a confirmable plan by the end of calendar year following further negotiations  the bondholders committee  the acc  the fcr  representatives of holders of pre petition settlements and congoleum reached an agreement in principle and a term sheet describing the proposed material terms of a contemplated new plan of reorganization and a settlement of avoidance litigation with respect to pre petition claim settlements the litigation settlement was entered into by those parties and was filed with the bankruptcy court in august certain insurers and a large bondholder filed objections to the litigation settlement and or reserved their rights to object to confirmation of the contemplated new plan of reorganization 
the bankruptcy court approved the litigation settlement following a hearing in october  but the court reserved certain issues  including whether any plan of reorganization embodying the settlement meets the standards required for confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
in november  congoleum  the acc and the bondholders committee filed the amended joint plan 
in january  an insurer filed a motion for summary judgment seeking denial of confirmation of the amended joint plan 
a hearing was held in february and the bankruptcy court granted the insurer s motion finding certain provisions of the amended joint plan unconfirmable as a matter of law the summary judgment ruling and denying confirmation of the amended joint plan 
pursuant to the ruling  the bankruptcy court entered an order dismissing congoleum s bankruptcy case the order of dismissal 
in march  an order was entered by the bankruptcy court granting a stay of the bankruptcy court s order of dismissal pending a final non appealable decision affirming the order of dismissal 
in february  congoleum  the bondholders committee and acc appealed the order of dismissal and the summary judgment ruling to the district court 
in august  the district court issued the district court order reversing the order of dismissal 
with respect to the plan of reorganization  the district court ruled that a settlement with certain asbestos claimants was not an impediment to confirmation while another plan provision would require a minor modification 
the decision also provided specific guidance about the plan and directed the parties in the case to provide briefings in preparation for a confirmation hearing 
in addition  the district court assumed jurisdiction over the entire chapter proceedings from the bankruptcy court 
certain insurers have filed notices of appeal with respect to the district court order with the third circuit 
congoleum  the bondholders committee and the acc have moved to dismiss the appeals  and such motion is pending 
as a result of the multi insurer settlement  discussed below  the insurers appeal before the third circuit is presently suspended  and the applicable insurers have agreed to cause the appeal to be dismissed with prejudice within three business days of the district court s order approving the multi insurer settlement becoming a final order 
following additional negotiations  in october  the acc  the bondholders committee and congoleum jointly filed a revised plan of reorganization the second amended joint plan and disclosure statement with the district court 
in late and early  negotiations among congoleum  the bondholders committee  the fcr  the acc  other asbestos claimant representatives  and various insurers and new jersey insurance guaranty organizations culminated in a million settlement with nine insurance groups and the new jersey insurance guaranty associations the multi insurer settlement 
subject to various requirements set forth in the multi insurer settlement  the insurance companies and guaranty associations will pay million to settle certain policies issued to congoleum and such amount will be paid to the plan trust of which million will be available for the payment of asbestos claims 
the multi insurer settlement was approved by the district court in february on march   the fcr filed a notice of appeal from the district court s february  order that approved congoleum s insurance settlement agreement with the st 
paul s travelers entities 
on february   congoleum  the bondholders committee  the fcr and the acc jointly filed the third amended joint plan and disclosure statement with the district court 
in order to address comments received on the third amended joint plan from various parties  a further revised plan of reorganization and disclosure statement  the fourth amended joint plan  was filed with the district court on march  by congoleum  the bondholders committee  the fcr and the acc 
the terms of the third amended joint plan and fourth amended joint plan are substantially similar to those of the second amended joint plan 
on march   the district court approved the adequacy of the disclosure statement and voting procedures for the fourth amended joint plan and a confirmation hearing is scheduled to commence on june  abi has certain intercompany claims against and arrangements with congoleum 
the fourth amended joint plan would govern an intercompany settlement and ongoing intercompany arrangements among abi and its subsidiaries and reorganized congoleum  which would be effective if and when the fourth amended joint plan takes effect and which abi currently expects would have a term of two years 
the fourth amended joint plan provides that the final terms of the intercompany arrangements among abi and its subsidiaries and reorganized congoleum would be memorialized in a new agreement to be entered into by reorganized congoleum and american biltrite in form and substance mutually agreeable to the bondholders committee  the acc  the fcr and abi 
although t he form of the new agreement has not yet been filed with the district court  the current proposed plan on file with the district court contemplates that the form of the new agreement will be filed as a plan supplement 
abi currently expects that the form of the new agreement to be filed with the district court will be substantially similar to the forms of that new agreement filed with recent prior proposed plans of reorganization for congoleum and include the provision of management services by abi to reorganized congoleum and other business relationships substantially consistent with their traditional relationships 
the existing arrangements currently in effect among abi and its non debtor subsidiaries and congoleum expire on june   unless renewed 
in addition  under the terms of the fourth amended joint plan  abi s rights and claims to indemnification from congoleum under the existing joint venture agreement between abi and congoleum that relate to abi s contribution to congoleum in of abi s tile division  and the joint venture agreement itself  would be deemed rejected and disallowed upon the effective date of the fourth amended joint plan  and therefore eliminated 
the fourth amended joint plan s proposed rejection and disallowance of the joint venture agreement and abi s claims thereunder including any unfunded indemnification claims abi may have had prepetition and during the pendency of congoleum s chapter case as well as any such claims abi might otherwise have been entitled to assert after the fourth amended joint plan became effective 
there can be no assurance that abi  congoleum and other applicable congoleum constituencies will be able to reach agreement on the terms of any management services proposed to be provided by abi to reorganized congoleum or any other proposed business relationships among abi and its affiliates and reorganized congoleum 
any plan of reorganization for congoleum that m ay be confirmed may have terms that differ significantly from the terms contemplated by the fourth amended joint plan  including with respect to any management services that may be provided by abi to reorganized congoleum and abi s claims and interests and other business relationships with reorganized congoleum 
in addition  in view of abi s relationships with congoleum  abi will be affected by congoleum s negotiations regarding  and its pursuit of  any plan of reorganization  and there can be no assurance as to what that impact  positive or negative  might be 
in any event  the failure of congoleum to obtain confirmation and consummation of a chapter plan of reorganization would have a material adverse effect on congoleum s business  results of operations or financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on abi s business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the fourth amended joint plan or any other plan of reorganization  if proposed  will receive the acceptances necessary for confirmation  that the fourth amended joint plan will not be modified further  that any plan will receive necessary court approvals from the district court  that such approvals will be received in a timely fashion  that any plan will be confirmed  that any plan  if confirmed  will become effective  or that there will be sufficient funds to pay for continued proceedings with respect to any plan of reorganization 
in addition  certain insurers have filed notices of appeal with respect to the district court order with the third circuit 
although those insurers have agreed to cause that appeal to be dismissed with prejudice within three business days of the dis trict court s order approving the multi insurer settlement becoming a final order  there can be no assurance that such order will become a final order  that such appeal will be dismissed or that the district court order will not be reversed by the third circuit or other court having authority over the matter 
it also is unclear whether any other person might successfully propose and confirm a plan or what any such plan  if and when confirmed  would ultimately provide  and whether the district court would approve such a plan 
any plan of reorganization pursued by the company will be subject to numerous conditions  approvals and other requirements  including district court approvals  and there can be no assurance that such conditions  approvals and other requirements will be satisfied or obtained 
in order to obtain confirmation of any reorganization plan  congoleum will need sufficient funds to pay for the continued litigation with these insurers as well as the bankruptcy proceedings generally 
in addition  for a plan of reorganization to be confirmed  congoleum will need to obtain and demonstrate the sufficiency of exit financing 
congoleum cannot presently determine the terms of such financing  nor can there be any assurances of its success obtaining it 
abi estimates that it will spend an additional thousand for legal fees in  which it has accrued  in connection with congoleum s reorganization plan 
actual costs for pursuing and implementing the fourth amended joint plan or any plan of reorganization could be materially higher  and congoleum and the company may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
in addition  abi is also a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits in addition to those brought against congoleum 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
during  the company decided to discontinue the operations of its janus flooring corporation subsidiary  a manufacturer of pre finished hardwood flooring  and sell the related assets 
results of janus flooring  including charges resulting from the shutdown  are being reported as a discontinued operation 
during  the remaining assets of janus flooring were sold  and the discontinued operation was effectively dissolved 
as of december   the company merged janus flooring with and into ab canada 
during  the company recorded a gain of million related to the sale of a building and land of the discontinued operation 
due to congoleum s reorganization and separate capital structure  as well as the anticipated elimination of abi s ownership interest in congoleum  the company believes that presenting the results of operations of abi and its non debtor subsidiaries separately from those of congoleum is the most meaningful way to discuss and analyze its financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations abi and non debtor subsidiaries in thousands of dollars net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses impairment charges loss from operations interest expense  net other income  net loss before taxes and other items provision for benefit from income taxes net loss noncontrolling interests loss from continuing operations net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from sales of million in tape segment sales decreased million or due to lower sales volume of transfer paper  protective films  electrical tapes and hvac products  partly offset by an increase in automotive products 
canadian segment sales decreased million or due to lower sales of industrial products  flooring and the effect of currency translation 
jewelry segment sales decreased million or due to lower shipments to department stores 
gross profit was of net sales in compared to in tape segment gross margins improved by percentage points of net sales primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions 
canadian division gross margins declined by percentage points of net sales as lower margins on industrial products partly offset improved margins on flooring 
jewelry segment margins improved by percentage points of net sales due to improved sourcing and lower freight costs 
the company includes the cost of purchasing and finished goods inspection in selling  general and administrative expenses 
some companies also record such costs in operating expenses while others record them in cost of goods sold 
consequently  the company s gross profit margins may not be comparable to other companies 
had the company recorded these expenses in cost of sales  the gross profit margins for the years ended december  and would have been and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  down from million in tape division selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million primarily due to headcount reductions and lower spending on travel  entertainment  and advertising 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million at the canadian division mainly due to lower freight and commissions  as well as the impact of currency translation 
jewelry segment selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million from to primarily due to headcount reduction programs and other expense cuts 
in addition  corporate expenses not allocated to operations were significantly higher in than due to expenses in connection with a r efinancing and provisions for legacy environmental matters 
during  the company evaluated the recovery of goodwill and certain other capitalized intangibles related to the jewelry segment in light of that segment s recent operating performance  the economic environment  and market value conditions for similar businesses 
based on that evaluation  a non cash impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of which wrote off all goodwill and capitalized intangibles of the company 
the company also evaluated the recovery of its investment in hulera sula in light of hulera sula s operating losses for and a non cash impairment charge of thousand was recorded in to write off the company s investment in hulera sula 
net interest expense of million for was down thousand as a result of lower debt levels 
the effective tax rates for and were not significant due primarily to the establishment of valuation allowances against net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets  which may not be recovered by abi in future periods due to the uncertainty regarding abi s ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
the company incurred a loss of million from continuing operations for compared with a loss of million in with the change due to the million non cash impairment charge in coupled with the changes in operating results 
congoleum in thousands of dollars net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses asbestos related reorganization expenses loss from operations interest expense income  net other expense  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss net sales for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in sales resulted primarily from lower sales to the manufactured housing industry coupled with continued demand weakness in the new construction and remodeling markets reflecting the economic slowdown and tight credit conditions 
the decreases were partially mitigated by selling price increases instituted in late averaging and new product introductions during the fourth quarter of gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the lower gross margin dollars and percentage were primarily a result of the negative impact of lower production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead  partially offset by cost reduction programs instituted during the year  improved plant efficiencies and a more favorable product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the reduction in operating expenses reflects workforce reductions implemented in march coupled with non recurring merchandising costs in associated with launching a mass merchandiser program 
this was partially offset by higher pension expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
based on the terms of the fourth amended joint plan  in the fourth quarter of  congoleum recorded an additional million provision for estimated costs for completing the reorganization proceedings 
in the third quarter of congoleum had recorded an million charge based on its then current proposed reorganization plans 
the loss from operations  excluding the reorganization charges  was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss from operations of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this change in operating loss was a result of lower sales  coupled with the unfavorable impact of significantly lower production volumes on gross profit  partially offset by lower operating expenses 
interest income was negligible in versus million in  which included interest income from a legal fee settlement 
interest expense in was million as compared to interest expense of million in other expense of million in was million lower than prior year primarily as a result of recoveries from legal claims and insurance settlements received in provision for income taxes was million in as compared to a benefit of million in the tax provision related to an increase in deferred taxes due to additional operating loss carry forwards offset by an increase in valuation allowances and an increase in current taxes due to adjustments of prior year estimates 
the million tax benefit was attributable to a significant pre tax loss in offset by million for the impact of non deductible legal reserves related to congoleum s reorganization plan and by a million increase in the valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets benefit in liquidity and capital resources abi and non debtor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments  decreased by thousand to million at december  as compared to december  total debt at december  was million  down million from december  working capital at december  was million  compared with million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was compared to at december  due to its expected refinancing  all abi s term debt was classified as current at december   but the majority of it million was classified as non current at december  this contributed to the increase in working capital and the current ratio 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was million compared with cash used of million for the year ended december  the primary sources of the million in cash from operating activities in were a million reduction in inventory and a million reduction in receivables 
inventories increased by million in  and the fluctuations in inventory account for most of the change in cash from operations during capital expenditures for were million compared to million for the company has recorded provisions which it believes are adequate for environmental remediation  including provisions for testing and potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities  and non asbestos product related liabilities 
while the company believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  that most of such amounts will be paid over a period of one to ten years and that the company expects to have sufficient resources to fund such amounts  the actual timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from the company s assumptions 
in addition  legislation and regulation regarding climate change  including greenhouse gas emissions  and other environmental matters may be adopted or administered and enforced differently in the future  which could req uire the company to expend significant amounts 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on the company s costs  the company is not aware of any pending legislation or regulation relating to these matters that would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position  except as disclosed in item legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
there can be no assurances that any such costs could be passed along to its customers 
american biltrite inc s primary source of borrowings are the revolving credit facility the revolver and the term loan term loan it has with wachovia bank  national association wachovia pursuant to a loan and security agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement was entered into on june   and initial borrowings on the credit agreement were used to pay off borrowings from another financial institution and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing 
the credit agreement provides american biltrite inc and its subsidiaries with i a million commitment under the revolver including a million canadian revolving credit facility sublimit and ii an million term loan 
the credit agreement also provides letter of credit facilities with availability of up to million including a million canadian letters of credit facility sublimit subject to availability under the revolver 
the maximum amount available for revolving debt borrowings is reduced to the amount of the borrowing base if that amount is lower 
the borrowing base is based upon eligible assets of the company  including accounts receivables and inventory 
the company s obligations under the credit agreement are secured by assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
at dece mber   the company had million and million outstanding under the revolver and term loan  respectively  and million of additional unused borrowing capacity available under the revolver 
the term loan principal is payable in monthly installments of thousand beginning august  and ending on july  all indebtedness under the credit agreement  other than the term loan  matures on june  interest is payable monthly on borrowings under the credit agreement at rates based on a base interest rate plus an applicable margin for each type of loan  which varies depending on whether the loan is based on us  canadian  or eurodollar rate loans and which ranges from an applicable rate of two hundred basis points over us and canadian base rates to four hundred basis points over eurodollar base rates for revolving debt loans and three hundred basis points over us base rates and five hundred basis points over eurodollar base rates for the term loan 
the credit agreement charges the company a monthly unused borrowing line fee  at a rate equal to five eighths of one percent per annum 
in addition  the credit agreement imposes a monthly letter of credit fee equal to four percent per annum for unused letter of credit availability 
pursuant to the credit agreement  payments on the company s accounts receivable are deposited in accounts assigned by the company and the other borrowers to wachovia and the funds in that account may used by wachovia to pay down outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains customary bank covenants  including limitations on incurrence of debt and liens or other encumbrances on assets or properties  sale of assets  making of loans or investments  including paying dividends and redemptions of capital stock  the formation or acquisition of subsidiaries and transactions with affiliates 
the credit agreement requires the company and the other borrowers and the guarantors to maintain  on a consolidated basis  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of the credit agreement also requires that the company and the other borrowers and the guarantors to maintain  on a consolidated basis  a minimum amount of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  as determined under the credit agreement 
the company s obligation to meet th e minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization covenants would not apply for any monthly test period during which the company s unused available credit under the credit agreement was at least million for consecutive days 
in march  the company and wachovia entered into an amendment of the credit agreement 
the amendment reduced the minimum required levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization under the credit agreement  and further provided that meeting the minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio would not be required for any monthly test period during which the company s unused available credit under the credit agreement was at least million for consecutive days 
the company paid a fee of thousand to wachovia in connection with this amendment 
the company currently anticipates it will be able to comply with these covenants as revised by the recent amendment 
however  the company had to receive covenant waivers on several occasions under its prior credit agreement or enter amendments to that agreement to address failures to satisfy covenants under that prior credit agreement  and it is possible that  in the future  the company may need to obtain waivers for failures to satisfy its covenants under the credit agreement or enter amendments to the credit agreement to address any such failures or obtain replacement financing as a result 
there can be no assurance the company would be successful in obtaining any such waiver  entering any such amendment or obtaining any such replacement financing 
any waivers  amendments and or replacement financing  if obtained  could result in significant cost to the company 
if an event of default under the credit agreement were to occur  the lenders could cease to make borrowings available under the revolver and require the company to repay all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
if the company were unable to repay those amounts due  the lenders could have their rights over the collateral exercised  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
on june   the company also entered into accounts receivable financing agreements the fgi financing agreements with faunus group international fgi 
the fgi financing agreements were intended to provide up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of million in net amounts funded based upon an advance rate 
fees under the fgi financing agreements included a monthly collateral management fee equal to of the average monthly balance of accounts purchased by fgi as well as interest on the daily net funds employed at a rate equal to the greater of i or ii above fgi s prime rate  and were subject to certain minimum monthly amounts 
abi s ability to borrow funds under the fgi financing agreements during was less than anticipated  at december   the company had thousand payable to fgi 
in january  the company terminated the fgi financing agreement  repaid the outstanding balance  and paid an thousand early termination fee 
under the terms of the fourth amended joint plan  abi s ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated 
abi expects that its ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated under any alternate plan or outcome in congoleum s chapter case 
while the company does not believe the loss of the value of its equity interest in congoleum would have a direct material adverse effect on abi s liquidity  the loss of a controlling interest could have a material adverse impact on the business relationships between abi and congoleum  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on abi s business  operations and financial condition 
in connection with congoleum s plan of reorganization  abi expects to spend thousand in  which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on abi s working capital or cash flow 
the company has not declared a dividend subsequent to the third quarter of the credit agreement generally prohibits the company from paying cash dividends to its stockholders 
therefore  so long as the credit agreement remains outstanding  the company would need to obtain the consent of the lenders under the credit agreement to pay dividends to its stockholders in the future 
in addition to this need for lender consent  any determination to pay future dividends would be made by the company s board of directors based upon  among other considerations  the financial performance and capital requirements of the company  as well as market conditions 
liquidity and capital resources congoleum the consolidated financial statements of congoleum  which are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  have been prepared on a going concern basis 
a going concern basis contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements of congoleum do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should congoleum be unable to continue as a going concern 
as described more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about congoleum s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabi lities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court case no 
seeking relief under the bankruptcy code

in the fourth quarter of congoleum also recorded a million interest expense credit to reverse post petition interest accrued on its senior notes 
terms of previous reorganization plans had provided  among other things  for the payment of post petition interest on the senior notes and therefore congoleum had continued to accrue such interest 
under the terms of the joint plan  and the terms of all subsequent plans proposed to date  including the fourth amended joint plan  the senior note holders would not have received any post petition interest 
based on developments affecting the expected timing of its reorganization plans  congoleum recorded an additional charge of million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of for costs to effect its reorganization 
in february  the bankruptcy court ordered congoleum s former counsel  then known as gilbert heintz randolph llp ghr to disgorge all fees and certain expenses it was paid by congoleum 
in october  congoleum and ghr entered into a settlement with ghr the ghr settlement under which ghr was to pay congoleum approximately million plus accrued interest in full satisfaction of the disgorgement order

congoleum is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between million and million in  primarily for maintenance and improvement of plants and equipment  which it expects to fund with cash from operations and borrowings under credit facilities 
in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing agreement as amended and approved by the bankruptcy court or the district court to date provides a revolving credit facility expiring on the earlier of i june  and ii the date the plan of reorganization in congoleum s bankruptcy cases becomes effective 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants  which include the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization congoleum ebitda 
the financing agreement also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financing agreement must be met in order for congoleum to borrow from the facility 
congoleum was not in compliance with the minimum congoleum ebitda covenant under its credit facility for the period ended december   and obtained a waiver of that covenant as well as an amendment of the covenant levels for the remaining term of the facility to make them less restrictive 
the interest rate was increased to above the prime rate 
during the second quarter of congoleum received an extension of the existing financing facility to december  a covenant modification and extension fee of thousand was paid in connection with this extension  plus a monthly extension fee of thousand per month 
in connection with the amendment for the period ending december   minimum congoleum ebitda covenants were set for the months ending up through december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by congoleum s inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
in november  congoleum and its debtor in possession lender agreed to a further modification of the credit facility that extends the facility until the earlier of june  and the date the plan of reorganization in congoleum s bankruptcy cases becomes effective

a thousand amendment fee was paid by congoleum and a thousand monthly fee is payable by congoleum in connection with this amendment 
there can be no assurances that congoleum will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants under this facility or that the debtor in possession facility will be renewed prior to its expiration if a plan of reorganization is not confirmed before that time 
congoleum was in compliance with the terms of its debtor in possession financing at december   as the excess borrowing availability it maintained under the revolving line of credit exceeded the threshold at which it was required to meet minimum congoleum ebitda levels 
congoleum anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility including anticipated extensions thereof together with cash from operations will provide it with sufficient liquidity to operate during while under chapter protection 
for a plan of reorganiz ation to be confirmed  congoleum will need to obtain and demonstrate the sufficiency of exit financing 
there can be no assurances congoleum will be able to obtain such exit financing or under what terms it might be obtained 
in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  congoleum has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
congoleum is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against congoleum 
among these claims  congoleum is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of congoleum s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of congoleum s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
congoleum has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while congoleum believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from congol eum s assumptions 
in addition  legislation and regulation regarding climate change  including greenhouse gas emissions  and other environmental matters may be adopted or administered and enforced differently in the future  which could require congoleum to expend significant amounts 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on congoleum s costs  congoleum is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against congoleum 
congoleum s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
congoleum believes that its existing cash including restricted cash  cash generated from operations  and debtor in possession credit arrangements should be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for operations during the period of during which congoleum s chapter case remains pending 
congoleum s ability to emerge from chapter will depend on obtaining sufficient exit financing to settle administrative expenses of the reorganization and any other related obligations  and to provide adequate future liquidity 
contingencies abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters  except as disclosed in item legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial st atements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its consolidated financial statements for the estimated p robable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results and conditions may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company is party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from their previous manufacture of asbestos containing products 
abi has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the claims dismissal rate  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
additionally  due to the numerous uncertainties related to future asbestos l itigation trends and costs  the company does not believe reasonable estimates can be developed for claim developments beyond a six year horizon 
accordingly  the company s estimated liability is based on claims currently filed as well as claims anticipated to be filed over the next six years 
a change in assumptions could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability 
the estimate is sensitive to changes in the mesothelioma acceptance rate 
for example  if the calibration window is shifted by one year to the to calibration period  the mesothelioma acceptance rate decreases by to  and this reduces the liability in the low estimate by about assuming all other variables remain constant 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from those assumed in developing the company s estimates 
the same factors that affect developing forecasts of potential indemnity costs for asbestos related liabilities also affect estimates of the total am ount of insurance that is probable of recovery  as do a number of additional factors 
these additional factors include the financial viability of some of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies  how legal and other loss handling costs will be covered by the insurance policies  and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships 
the company analyzes these estimates on an annual basis and reassesses the assumptions used as additional information becomes available over the course of time 
congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
during  congoleum paid million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code and litigation with certain insurance companies 
based on the fourth amended joint plan  congoleum has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum estimated cost to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through confirmation of a plan that complies with section g of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum recorded charges aggregating approximately million in prior years 
based on the terms of the fourth amended joint plan  in the fourth quarter of congoleum recorded an additional million charge for e stimated costs for the reorganization proceedings and coverage litigation 
congoleum expects to receive million from the trust at confirmation related to claims processing fees previously paid 
in anticipation of congoleum s commencement of the chapter cases  congoleum entered into a claimant agreement  which provides for settlement of certain prepetition asbestos claims against congoleum and provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million as well as an additional number of individually negotiated trial listed settlements with an aggregate value of approximately million  for total settlements in excess of million 
participants in the claimant agreement signed releases limiting their recourse against congoleum to what they would receive from the plan trust and congoleum has therefore estimated its liability under the claimant agreement as the cost of effecting the settlement through confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
in addition  as a result of tabulating ballots on a previous plan  congoleum is also aware of claims by claimants whose claims were not determined under the claimant agreement but who have submitted claims with a value of approximately million based on the settlement values applicable in a previous plan 
it is also likely that additional new claims may be asserted in connection with solicitation of acceptances of any future plan 
congoleum does not believe it can reasonably estimate the liability associated with claims that may be pending 
abi understands that congoleum expects that insurance will provide the substantial majority of the recovery available to congoleum s asbestos claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of congoleum itself 
congoleum believes it has insufficient limited financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
while congoleum has provided for the anticipated costs to effect the fourth amended joint plan  costs for pursuing and implementing the fourth amended joint plan and any plan of reorganization could be materially higher than recorded amounts and previous estimates 
congoleum will update its estimates  if appropriate  as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  which could result in potentially material adjustments to congoleum s earnings in future periods 
consolidation of congoleum the company s subsidiary congoleum filed for bankruptcy protection on december  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results for congoleum for all periods presented 
abi expects to continue to own a majority of the voting stock of congoleum until congoleum s reorganization proceedings are concluded 
upon effectiveness of any plan of reorganization for congoleum  abi expects that the plan will provide that abi s shares of congoleum will be cancelled 
the company has elected to continue to consolidate the financial statements of congoleum in its consolidated results because it believes that is the appropriate presentation given its current voting control of congoleum 
however  the accompanying financial statements also present the details of consolidation to separately show the financial condition  operating results and cash flows of abi including its non debtor subsidiaries and congoleum  which may be more meaningful for certain analyses 
abi s reported consolidated financial condition  operating results and cash flows results would be materially different if they did not include congoleum 
the company anticipates its equity interest in congoleum will be eliminated in connection with the effectiveness of any future congoleum plan of reorganization  at which time it will no longer include congoleum in the company s consolidated financial statements 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company accrues for its estimate of future remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remedia tion experience 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
for sites with multiple potentially responsible parties  the company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage or payment from third parties  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the expected recovery 
a receivable reserve is recorded when recoveries are disputed or are not highly probable 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that t he company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
the company closely monitors existing and potential environmental matters to consider the reasonableness of its estimates and assumptions 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize as anticipated in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of the company s employees 
the company also maintains health and life insurance programs for retirees 
benefits under the plans are based on years of service and employee compensation 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management 
other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
in and  the company assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past actuarial gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is used to determine expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of the related receivables  including the length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances where the company is made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously noted 
the remainder of the reserve is based on m anagement s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of the company s customer base 
the risk associated with this estimate is that the company would not become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  the company s estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and the company has processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
inventory allowances the company maintains obsolescence and slow moving allowances for inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
the remainder of the allowance is based on management s estimates and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
management closely monitors the market place and related inventory levels and has historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  the company values certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is maintained to properly value these inventories 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses its long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
to analyze recoverability  it projects undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment would be recognized  resulting in a write down of the assets with a corresponding charge to earnings 
the impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its other long lived assets on an annual basis
