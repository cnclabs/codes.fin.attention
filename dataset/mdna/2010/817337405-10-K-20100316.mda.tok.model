item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a molecular diagnostic testing and genetics analysis company committed to providing products  services  diagnostic testing  applications and genetic analysis products that translate the results of genomic science into solutions for biomedical research  translational research  molecular medicine applications  and agricultural  livestock  and other areas of research 
our development and commercialization efforts in various diagnostic areas include noninvasive women s health related and prenatal diagnostics  age related macular degeneration diagnostics  oncology  infectious diseases  and other disorders and diseases 
our proprietary massarray system  comprised of hardware  software applications  consumable chips and reagents  is a high performance in speed  accuracy and cost efficiency nucleic acid analysis platform that quantitatively and precisely measures genetic target material and variations 
our platform is widely accepted as a leading high performance dna analysis platform for the fine mapping genotyping market and continues to gain traction for newer applications  such as agricultural biotechnology and clinical research 
our customers include premier clinical research laboratories  bio agriculture  bio technology and pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  and various government agencies worldwide 
to provide customer support for our expanding user base and in an effort to maximize market penetration  we have established direct sales and support personnel serving north america  europe and asia  in addition to distribution partners in several major countries throughout the world 
we are researching  developing and pursuing the commercialization of various noninvasive molecular diagnostic tests for prenatal genetic disorders and diseases  women s health related disorders and diseases  age related macular degeneration diagnostics  oncology  infectious diseases  and other diseases and disorders 
we have branded our diagnostic technology for prenatal diagnostics under the trademark sequredx 
our efforts in molecular diagnostics are focused on noninvasive diagnostics currently using our proprietary massarray system  however  we may in the future employ other instrumentation platforms with our diagnostic applications as may be more suitable on a case by case basis considering optimum test performance and commercialization factors 
currently  we are primarily focused on developing and commercializing prenatal screening and diagnostic tests using our foundational  patent protected  noninvasive  circulating cell free fetal ccff nucleic acid based assay technology 
this technology uses a simple maternal blood draw meaning noninvasive compared to invasive procedures such as amniocentesis  chorionic villus sampling  or surgery for a prenatal diagnosis or risk assessment in order to provide reliable information about the status of the fetus early in pregnancy 
in early we launched noninvasive rhesus d genotyping and fetal xy sex determination laboratory developed tests ldts using this patented ccff technology which we in license from isis innovation limited isis 
we also launched  in september  a noninvasive molecular based cystic fibrosis carrier screening ldt 
these tests have all been launched through our college of american pathology cap accredited and clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia certified laboratory  sequenom center for molecular medicine  llc  located in grand rapids  michigan 
most molecular genetic tests are ldts 
we have made substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure to enhance the capabilities of our laboratory to track samples and provide electronic ordering and reporting  and have put in place sample collection and transportation logistics that can be readily scaled 
we are entering into contracts with third party payors to establish pricing for our tests and provide reimbursement 
we also plan to conduct the development  validation  and other activities necessary to file submissions with the food and drug administration fda seeking approval for selected diagnostic tests 
revenues from our cystic fibrosis test were not significant from september through the end of our massarray system provides reliable results for a wide range of dna rna analysis applications including single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping detection of mutations  analysis of copy number variants and other structural genome variations 
in addition  the system provides quantitative gene expression 
table of contents analysis  quantitative dna methylation analysis  comparative sequence analysis of haploid organisms  snp discovery  and oligonucleotide quality control 
these applications are provided through proprietary application software that operates on the massarray platform and through the purchase of consumable chips and reagent sets 
while the massarray system is versatile across many applications  it is a robust and cost effective genotyping solution for fine mapping projects enabled through our iplex multiplexing assay  which permits multiplexed snp analysis using approximately the same amount of reagents and chip surface area as is used for a single locus snp analysis 
we have targeted customers conducting quality genotyping and performing fine mapping studies  candidate gene studies  comparative sequencing  gene expression analysis  and epigenetic analysis in the molecular medicine market 
epigenetic analysis is an important part of cancer and other research areas 
dna methylation analysis is the most frequently studied epigenetic change  and examines changes in the presence or absence of methyl groups in specific areas of the dna 
we are targeting customers for our genetic analysis technology and products across four segments biomedical research and molecular medicine  oncology and translational research  clinical research  public health initiatives  biodefense and agriculture 
we believe the market and opportunities for growth for fine mapping genotyping are increasing as more researchers are completing their larger genomic studies such as whole genome scans 
epigenetic analysis is an emerging market that  along with gene expression analysis  is increasingly being utilized by researchers in conjunction with genotyping to attempt to fully understand genetic cause and effect 
as of december   our revenues consisted of sales of massarray hardware  software  consumables  maintenance agreements  diagnostic testing and from services contracts through our genetic analysis contract research services business 
the impact of our product offerings and contract research services business on future revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows remains uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
expected revenues from our launched molecular tests cystic fibrosis carrier screen  rhesus d genotyping  and fetal xy sex determination tests are uncertain and difficult to predict 
these tests have only recently been launched  demand for and acceptance of these tests by physicians and their patients is uncertain  and the level of reimbursement applicable to the cystic fibrosis carrier screen and rhesus d genotyping tests is also uncertain 
the fetal xy sex determination test is paid for directly by the patient and is not subject to reimbursement because it is not a medically necessary test 
as a result  our entitlement to  and the timing and amounts of  any revenues from molecular diagnostic products are uncertain and difficult to predict at this early point in time following their launch 
such revenues are uncertain and also depend on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  and management expects to incur further losses for the foreseeable future 
our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and current marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million  which based on our current projections will not be sufficient to fund our obligations through the end of the third quarter of if we continue spending at our current levels 
therefore  we plan to pursue raising additional debt and or equity financing through private or public offerings  but we cannot assure you that such financing or transaction will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the uncertainty of this situation raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the failure to continue as a going concern 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these 
table of contents accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and conditions are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
the estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an assessment that falls within the range of reasonable estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for consumables  massarray and other product related sales in accordance with current accounting rules  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  for massarray system sales  the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the separate units of accounting are typically the system and software itself and maintenance contracts sold at the time of the system sale 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue from sales of massarray systems with general standard payment terms of days or less are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer or when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized upon transfer of title to the customer or the duration of the software license 
we recognize revenue on maintenance services for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from genetic services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
diagnostic revenues from our carrier screening test for cystic fibrosis  which was commercially launched in september  have been recognized on a cash basis due to the limited number of contracts or agreements we have with third party payors and our limited collections experience 
we generally bill third party payors upon generation and delivery of a report to the physician 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and risk of collection with the third party payor 
we usually bill the patient directly for amounts not covered by their insurance carrier in the form of co pays and deductibles  but only after multiple requests for full payment have been denied or only partially paid by the insurance carrier 
some payors may not cover our carrier screening test for cystic fibrosis  as ordered by the physician  under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we pursue case by case reimbursement where policies are not in place 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are as follows goodwill and impairment of long lived assets 
the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 

table of contents additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our goodwill and long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no impairment of long lived assets was recorded in  or intangible assets totaled million  net of accumulated amortization  at december  allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable balance based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review the historical loss rates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
during  slow moving inventory reserves of million were charged against cost of goods sold and the total reserve was million at december  income taxes 
our provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december   we maintain a valuation allowance against our us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the more likely than not threshold 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 

table of contents stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model bsm and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
recent accounting pronouncements as of july   the financial accounting standards board fasb formally approved the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards  other than guidance issued by the sec 
at that time  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the provisions of the codification in the third quarter of the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued

in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that significantly changes the accounting and reporting requirements for business combination transactions  including capitalization of in process research and development assets and expensing acquisition costs as incurred 
this guidance became effective for business combination transactions occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of this guidance in the first quarter of the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that clarifies how to account for acquired intangible assets subsequent to initial measurement in situations in which an entity does not intend to actively use the assets but intends to hold the asset to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset a defensive intangible asset  except for intangible assets that are used in research and development activities 
this guidance requires that a defensive intangible asset be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting and assigned a useful life that reflects the entity s consumption of the expected benefits related to that asset 
this guidance became effective for intangible assets acquired on or after december  we adopted the provisions of this guidance in the first quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the criteria for determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as derivative instruments or equity instruments 
the guidance became effective for years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of the guidance in the first quarter of the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends the guidance for estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible assets and requires additional disclosure related to renewing or extending the useful lives of 
table of contents recognized intangible assets 
this guidance became effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of this guidance in the first quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that defines collaborative arrangements and requires that transactions with third parties that do not participate in the arrangement be reported in the appropriate income statement line items pursuant to existing authoritative accounting literature 
in accordance with this guidance  income statement classification of payments made between participants of a collaborative arrangement is to be based on other applicable authoritative accounting literature 
if the payments are not within the scope or analogy of other authoritative accounting literature  a reasonable  rational and consistent accounting policy is to be elected 
this guidance became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and was to be applied as a change in accounting principle to all prior periods retrospectively for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance in the first quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
massarray and other product related revenues are derived from the sale of massarray systems  consumables  sales and licensing of our proprietary software  maintenance contracts  and license fees from end users 
diagnostic revenues are from the sale of our carrier screening ldt for cystic fibrosis and consisted of cash collected from tests performed through december  consumable sales increased to million in from million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased consumables orders from our customers in the biomedical research and agricultural biology markets 
massarray and other product related revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease in massarray system hardware and software revenue to million in from million in  which was attributable to fewer system placements during the year ended december  revenue from other product sales  including massarray system maintenance contracts  license fees and royalties for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
maintenance revenue increased by approximately million in  as compared to due to higher service contracts in effect over our installed base 
we recorded genetic analysis service revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in service revenues for the year ended december  the decrease from is attributable to our cost cutting initiative that commenced in april  which refocused our genetic analysis service business on fewer  higher margin studies and projects 
we expect genetic analysis service revenues to be minimal going forward we recognized diagnostic revenue of  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
diagnostic revenue is currently generated only from our carrier screening test for cystic fibrosis  which we commercialized in september diagnostic revenue is recognized upon cash collection as payments are received 
diagnostic revenue going forward is uncertain and difficult to predict due to the lack of historical sales trends associated with our recent commercial launch of this test 
research and other revenue was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the timing of research revenues depends upon our expenditures on grant research and the receipt of the grant funding from the sponsoring agencies 
we expect research revenue to be minimal going forward 
domestic and non us revenues were million and million for the year ended december   respectively  and million and million for the year ended december   respectively 

table of contents the following table presents revenue for each reportable segment for the year ended december  prior to  all revenue was derived from our genetic analysis operations 
in thousands revenues molecular diagnostics genetic analysis our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the unpredictable sales cycle for the massarray system  general economic conditions  revenue recognition criteria  the overall acceptance and demand for our new and existing commercial products and services  as well as the adoption rates of our cystic fibrosis carrier screening assay  rhesus d genotyping assay  fetal xy sex determination assay and future assays 
costs of consumables and products  services and diagnostic revenues and gross margins cost of consumables products revenues were million and million and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for product revenues in compared to is attributable to increased consumable sales that generally have higher average gross margins compared to systems sales and is also due to fewer system placements  which historically sell at lower gross margins 
cost of service revenues were million and million and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margins decreased compared to the prior year due to the completion of remaining unfavorable  low volume contracts 
gross margins on contract research services have been dependent on particular contract terms of the work undertaken  as well as the particular market in which the services are being performed  the size of the projects and the pricing terms 
cost of diagnostic revenues are recognized at the completion of testing and were million and and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin on diagnostic tests are primarily affected by test volumes and overall reimbursement for the amount paid per test 
our overall gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in overall gross margin in is attributable to lower system and contract research revenues  which are sold at a lower margin than consumables 
the increase in consumables revenue during  as compared to  also contributed to the improved margin 
we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  the selling price for systems and consumables  consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of product sales and the type of services  competitive conditions  sales volumes  discounts offered  sales through distributors  as well as the cost of goods sold  inventory reserves and obsolescence charges required and royalty payment obligations on in licensed technologies

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  our use of cash was primarily a result of the net loss of million for the year ended december   increased by million from other current assets and prepaid expenses  million in deferred rent  million from lower accounts payable and accrued expense balances  million of lower other longer term liabilities and an adjustment to our bad debt provision resulting in a benefit of million due to recoveries of previously reserved balances

additionally  cash usages were primarily offset by operating asset and liability changes of million from lower accounts receivable and million from lower inventory balances representing our efforts to maximize working capital and an increase in our deferred revenue balance of million primarily associated with an increase in the sale of maintenance contracts from the prior year 
at our current and anticipated level of operating loss  we expect to continue to incur an operating cash outflow for the next several years

in september  we entered into an amendment to our lease for our corporate headquarters in san diego 
the lease amendment provides for the deferral of approximately million of the monthly rent payments by reducing the monthly payments through september  and increasing the aggregate monthly payments by the deferred amount for the remaining term of the lease  from october  to september  the total obligation under the lease remains unchanged 
the contractual obligation table above reflects the deferral of these rent payments 
long term debt obligations include the associated interest payable on these borrowings 
other commitments and contingencies that may result in contractual obligations to pay are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
based on our current plans  we believe our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities will not be sufficient to fund our obligations through the third quarter of if we continue spending at our current levels 
the actual amount of funds that we will need will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated 
these factors include but are not limited to the size of our future operating losses  the level of our and our distributors success in selling our massarray products and services and ldt services through sequenom cmm  the terms and conditions of sales contracts  including extended payment terms  our ability to introduce and sell new products and services and successfully reduce inventory levels of earlier products  the level of our selling  general and administrative expenses  the extent of our investment in diagnostic technology  including prenatal genetic analysis technology  molecular diagnostics and noninvasive prenatal diagnostic technology  development  commercialization  and regulatory approval  our success in  and the expenses associated with  researching  developing and commercializing diagnostic products  alone or in collaboration with our partners  and obtaining any required regulatory approval for those products  the level of our success alone or in collaboration with our partners in launching and selling any diagnostic products and services

the letter of credit related to our newton  massachusetts building lease agreement will remain in place until its expiration in december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk marketable securities the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and interest rates later rise  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we revised our investment policy in april to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including us government securities with ratings of aaa  and repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities with ratings of aaa 
our investment policy includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments  as well as limits the amount of credit exposure to only issuances from the us government 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to market risk of the investment 
the appropriate classification of marketable securities is determined at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
based on this determination  as of december  and  all of our investments in marketable securities were classified as available for sale and were reported at fair value 
we measure fair value based on the prices that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness  credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are charged to operations and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we use the specific identification method of determining the cost basis in computing realized and unrealized gains and losses on the sale of our available for sale securities 
consistent with our investment policy guidelines in effect when originally purchased  the auction rate security ars investments held by us all had aaa aa credit ratings at the time of purchase 
at december  
table of contents  million of principal was invested in ars 
the ars held are private placement securities with various long term nominal maturities with interest rates reset through a dutch auction each month 
the monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities 
the investments in ars represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by insurance securitizations and other structured credits  including corporate bonds and to a lesser degree  pools of residential and commercial mortgages 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  the ars held at december  had experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
although the majority of our ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  based on valuation models and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we recognized a loss of approximately million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively  which reflects the portion of ars holdings that we have concluded have an other than temporary decline in value 
during the fourth quarter of  our management determined that it was no longer our intent to hold the remaining ars to maturity and to actively pursue liquidation of our remaining ars in the secondary market 
as a result of this decision  during the fourth quarter of we sold ars with an estimated fair value of million  which resulted in a net realized loss of approximately million for a total loss on our ars of million for the year ended december  as of december   our remaining ars have a principal value of million and an estimated fair market value of million 
subsequent to year end  ars with a principal value of million and an estimated fair value of million at december   were sold 
the proceeds for these ars were equal to their estimated fair value as of december  our other remaining ars with a principal value of million have an estimated fair value of as of december  since there is a lack of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of marketable securities in ars  we utilize valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates  overall capital market liquidity and our overall intent and ability to liquidate our ars 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
in the event we need to access the ars investments that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
the market value of these securities may decline 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound gbp  the japanese yen yen  the indian rupee inr and the euro eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
additionally  we occasionally invoice australian customers in their local currency 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 

table of contents the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary having the asset or liability 
functional currency of operations as of december  net foreign monetary assets liabilities aus dollars euro in millions usd a movement of in the us dollar to australian dollar exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  a movement of in the us dollar to eur exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the years ended december   or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
