credit risk 
we monitor our risk of loss due to non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
our principal exposure to credit risk is through joint interest receivables million at december  and the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production  which we market to energy marketing companies  refineries and affiliates million in receivables at december  
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
note organization and summary of significant accounting policies 
joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own partial interest in the wells we operate 
these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill 
we can do very little to choose who participates in our wells 
in order to minimize our exposure to credit risk we request prepayment of drilling costs where it is allowed by contract or state law 
for such prepayments  a liability is recorded and subsequently reduced as the associated work is performed 
in this manner  we reduce credit risk 
we also have the right to place a lien on our co owners interest in the well to redirect production proceeds in 
table of contents order to secure payment or  if necessary  foreclose on the interest 
historically  our credit losses on joint interest receivables have been immaterial 
we monitor our exposure to counterparties on crude oil and natural gas sales primarily by reviewing credit ratings  financial statements and payment history 
we extend credit terms based on our evaluation of each counterparty s credit worthiness 
we have not generally required our counterparties to provide collateral to support crude oil and natural gas sales receivables owed to us 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations 
we may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our revolving credit facility 
we had revolving credit facility debt of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at february  the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in increased interest expense of approximately million per year and a million decrease in net income 
our revolving credit facility matures in and the weighted average interest rate at february  was 
on september   we issued million of senior notes due the notes  which carry a coupon rate of  were sold at a discount of of par and equates to an effective yield to maturity of approximately 
interest is payable on the notes on each april and october  commencing april  the following table presents our long term debt maturities and the weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total fixed rate debt senior notes principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt revolving credit facility principal amount weighted average interest rate this amount does not reflect the discount at which the notes were issued of million 
changes in interest rates affect the amount we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
all of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and does not expose us to the risk of cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt
