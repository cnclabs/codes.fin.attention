item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
note to the financial statements contain segment information 
overview results of operations the engineering segment provides consulting services relating to the development  management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project services 
services provided by the engineering segment include feasibility studies  engineering  design  procurement  and construction management 
the construction segment provides construction management personnel and services in the areas of inspection  construction  construction management  process plant turnaround management  plant asset management  commissioning and start up 
the automation segment provides services related to the design  fabrication  and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems  advanced automation  information technology and heat tracing projects 
the land segment provides land management  right of way  environmental compliance  legislative affairs support and governmental regulatory compliance services primarily to pipeline  utility and other owner operators of infrastructure facilities throughout the united states and canada 
the company s revenue is composed of engineering  procurement and construction service revenue and engineered systems sales 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as the services are performed 
the majority of the company s engineering services have historically been provided through cost plus contracts whereas a majority of the company s engineered system sales are earned on fixed price contracts 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide engineering  materials  and equipment and may provide construction services on a direct hire or subcontractor basis 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed  along with fees  which in total are at margins lower than those of our normal core business 
in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  all costs and fees are included in revenue 
the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  therefore  changes in revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
operating sg a expense includes management and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment s operation 
corporate sg a expense is comprised primarily of marketing costs  as well as costs related to executive  governance investor relations  finance  accounting  safety  human resources  project controls and information technology departments and other costs generally unrelated to specific client projects 
corporate sg a expense may vary as costs are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data derived from our consolidated statements of operations

of our overall revenue in  million  or was a result of the incremental revenue contribution from the august acquisition of pci management and consulting  and the september acquisition of advance control engineering 
we had decreases in revenue in of million  or  related to material and subcontractor purchases 
revenue also decreased in as a result of our clients continued cancellation or delay of scheduled capital projects due to the economy in general  lower energy commodity prices and lower energy processing margins 
our clients are continuing to perform run and maintain type smaller projects which focus on work for required maintenance to keep the plant up and running but not on new capital expansions 
competition has also increased greatly for the amount of project work on the market 
approximately of our revenue growth from to was due to additional work created by hurricane ike and from a refinery rebuild project 
both of these projects included large amounts of material and subcontractor purchases and were item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued completed by the first quarter of the balance of the revenue growth from to was due to an overall higher level of project activity in the markets we serve and in particular from the increased capital spending in the pipeline area which affected our construction  engineering and land segments 
gross profit the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in relative to was caused by several factors including lower utilization of our billable resources resulting in increased overhead costs to retain employees  increased overhead costs to expand our marketing to new sectors and new clients  increased per employee costs of benefits and market pressure to renegotiate some of our existing contracts  resulting in lower margins 
the major factor that contributed to lower gross profit margins in relative to was an increase of million in revenues related to low margin and pass through procurement and subcontracted construction revenue 
the remaining decline was due to increased work on lower margin services such as pipeline inspection 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the decrease in operating sg a expense for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  primarily consisted of decreases in bad debt expense of million  million in incentive bonus accruals for cancelled or modified plans  million in salaries and employee related expenses and million in office and marketing expenses  offset by increases of million in facilities expense and million in depreciation and amortization expense 
the decrease in operating sg a expense for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  primarily consisted of decreases in bad debt expense of million  million in salaries and employee related expenses  million in depreciation and amortization expense  and million in professional services  offset by increases of million in facilities expense 
in  the bad debt expense increased due to the creation of the reserve on the notes receivable for the sle project and amortization increased by  due to the goodwill impairment in the automation segment 
in  we also realized a gain of  from the sale of our building in baton rouge 
even though we did not have the significant increase in bad debt due to the sle project in  we did have increased amounts of general bad debt expense due to the economic instability that has caused some customers to file bankruptcy or to otherwise be unable to pay 
the decrease in corporate sg a expense for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  was primarily the result of decreases of million in incentive bonus accruals for cancelled or modified plans  million in salaries and employee related expenses  million in stock compensation expense and million in depreciation and amortization expense  offset by increases of million in facilities expenses and million in office expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  all other sg a expense increased to for the twelve months ended december   from for the comparable prior year period 
the increase in corporate sg a expense for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period in  was primarily the result of increases of million in salaries and employee related expenses  million in facilities expense  million in professional services for items such as sarbanes oxley sox compliance and professional consulting services  and million in amortization and depreciation expense 
these increases were offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of million 
as a percentage of revenue  corporate sg a decreased from in to in operating profit the decrease in operating income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  was attributable to lower revenue levels as well as increased costs for both new sales efforts and maintaining core employees at a time when the company had fewer projects 
these increased costs contributed to lower operating income as a percentage of revenue as well as decreased contract margins in response to market pressures 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase in operating income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  was primarily the result of higher levels of project activity in the markets we serve  along with savings in sg a 
other income expense other income in mainly consisted of  from insurance proceeds related to hurricane ike offset by expense of  in losses from an investment in a costa rican company 
other income for the same period in mainly consisted of an  gain on the sale of land not related to operations   of reimbursements for surplus of government tax funds  offset by expense of  in investment losses and  in tax penalties 
other income in was derived mainly from a loss of  on the sale of assets from the closing of our dallas office 
interest income expense interest expense decreased between and and between and due to the lower balances on our line of credit and a favorable libor rate option in our credit agreement

many of our clients have delayed or canceled scheduled capital projects due to the economy in general and lower energy commodity prices  as well as lower energy processing margins 
our clients are continuing to perform maintenance run and maintain projects which are smaller than many of the other projects we have historically been involved in 
competition has increased greatly for the amount of project work on the market 
although some of our clients have chosen different vendors  we still have a base of significant clients who continue to award projects to us 
we are also focusing on increased marketing efforts not only to expand our opportunities in the domestic chemical  refining and pipeline sectors  but to also expand into other markets within the energy and infrastructure sector 
renewable energy and applying engineering s capabilities on international projects appear to be areas of potential growth 
the engineering segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
the increase in engineering revenue in  as compared to  was primarily brought about by increased midstream and downstream capital spending in the energy industry 
refining related activity was particularly strong  including projects to satisfy environmental mandates  expand existing facilities and utilize heavier sour crude 
capital spending in the pipeline area also trended higher 
our detail design services have been affected the most by the current economy 
after a increase from to  these revenues decreased in by 
the decrease in is mainly due to decreased demand for engineering and related professional services for energy related projects 
we have also been affected by delayed or cancelled capital project work by clients in reaction to the current economy 
in  the increase was mainly due to a refinery rebuild project 
our field services revenues decreased by from to and again by from to due to general decreases in demand from our existing customers for in plant resources 
we are beginning to see some new opportunities for growth in this area and are exploring the possibility of acquiring new clients 
revenue from procurement services decreased in but had increased by in both the significant decrease in and increase in is primarily related to a large project to rebuild a client facility which was completed in the level of procurement services varies over time depending on the volume of procurement activity our customers choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services 
fixed price revenues increased in  as compared to  but had decreased in  as compared with the decrease in was the result of the company s decision to be more selective in the fixed price contracts it undertakes due to the risk of loss if the contract costs are not estimated accurately 
however  due to the current economy  more clients are requesting work to be performed on a fixed price basis to control their costs and shift risk to their contractors 
gross profit our engineering segment s total gross profit decreased in  as compared with  and decreased in  as compared with of the overall decrease in gross profit for  million was attributable to increased costs  while decreased revenues contributed to million of the overall decrease 
as a percentage of the engineering revenue  the engineering segment s gross profit decreased from in to in and to in the decrease in is partially the result of clients awarding new work based on competitive bidding  resulting in lower margins 
these lower margins along with increased per employee costs of benefits accounted for of the overall decrease in gross profit percentage 
in response to the decrease in work  we have decreased our number of employees 
however  realization of the cost savings associated with reducing our workforce lags a period of increased overhead costs associated with employees being removed from projects and being carried as non billable employees prior to termination 
the additional costs of carrying these extra employees accounts for of the overall gross profit percentage decline 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the decrease in total gross profit percentages for was due to the increase in low margin procurement services revenue 
we earn a lower margin on procurement services than we earn on our core engineering services 
for example  procurement services for produced a gross profit margin  whereas core engineering services produced a gross profit margin of 
if the company s business shifts away from predominantly engineering projects to epc projects which include material procurement and construction responsibility  engineering gross profit as a percentage of revenue will be negatively impacted 
this shift would precipitate lower gross profit because higher cost plus margins on engineering labor  recognized during the period in which it was earned  would be combined with the lower margins on procurement services and construction subcontractor charges and recorded throughout the duration of the projects 
in addition  if our business shifts more to fixed price work  our risk assessment and project management tools will be critical to our continued successful operations 
operating selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the decrease in the engineering segment s sg a expense in from was mainly attributable to decreases of million in bad debt expense  million in professional expenses  million in office expenses and million in salaries and employee related expenses  offset by increases of million in facilities expenses and million in depreciation and amortization expenses 
the decrease in the engineering segment s sg a expenses in from was a result of decreases of million in bad debt expense almost entirely related to the creation of the reserve against the sle notes receivable in also  amortization and depreciation decreased million  salaries and related employee expenses decreased million  and we realized a gain of  from the sale of our building in baton rouge 
operating income of the overall decrease in the engineering segment s operating income for stated as a percent of revenues  percentage points of change was due to lower margin work because of client pressures for competitive bidding  percentage points of change was due to the costs of carrying under utilized employees and percentage points of change was due to increased sg a expenses

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued construction segment twelve months ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands revenue before eliminations    inter segment eliminations    total revenue    detailed revenue inspection    construction services total revenue    gross profit    operating sg a expense    operating income  twelve months ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands revenue before eliminations    inter segment eliminations    total revenue    detailed revenue inspection    construction services   total revenue    gross profit   operating sg a expense   operating income   on august   the construction segment purchased the consulting operations of pci management and consulting pci 
pci provides consulting and project management services specializing in projects relating to the generation  transmission and distribution of energy 
these services complement the other services provided by our construction segment and we anticipate that pci s location  in the chicago  illinois area  will allow us to expand the construction segment s service territory and that pci will produce epc power project opportunities for the company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as a result of the acquisition  englobal expects to offer expanded services in the chicago and surrounding areas 
results of operations are included in the construction segment beginning august  revenue the construction segment contributed of our total revenue for our construction segment has been adversely affected by the current economic conditions 
as a result of the lower commodity prices  narrowing of energy processing margins and a difficult project financing environment  the construction segment s clients have chosen to defer and cancel significant capital projects and reduce maintenance spending 
these factors have contributed to our decrease in revenues for increased capital spending in the pipeline area in  particularly in inspection services  contributed to the overall increase in revenues for the construction segment s estimated backlog at december  was million but the backlog and previously anticipated growth expected for pipeline and osha plant inspections  as well as plant turnaround and construction management support projects and high tech maintenance services  may be negatively impacted by current economic conditions 
the revenue from this segment comes entirely from field services that are not typically limited to one project 
the company s past experience with this activity is that the term of these assignments on average spans multiple projects and multiple years 
gross income of the overall decrease in our construction segment s gross profit for  million was attributable to increased costs  while decreased revenues contributed to million of the overall decrease 
the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the overall decrease in available work and increased overhead costs incurred in connection with our efforts to win new work 
competitive pressures to lower margins has also contributed to the decrease in gross profit as well as increased employee related costs 
gross profit as a percentage of the construction segment s revenue decreased in while revenues increased significantly due to the changing mix of work being performed in this segment 
the main increase in work was in pipeline inspection related revenues which typically carry lower margins than our other revenues 
operating selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the overall decrease in our construction segment s sg a expense for was mainly attributable to decreases of  in bad debt expense   in incentive bonus accruals for cancelled or modified plans and  in depreciation and amortization expenses 
the overall increase in our construction segment s sg a expense for was mainly due to increases in salaries and related employee expenses of  amortization and depreciation expense of  and allowances for bad debt of  these increases were offset by savings of  in professional services and  in facilities expense 
operating income the overall decrease in our construction segment s operating income for was primarily attributable to the increased direct and indirect costs of approximately  offset by a savings in sg a expenses of

of the overall increase in our automation segment s revenue from to  approximately million was derived from non fabrication services that we were able to provide as a result of the september acquisition of advanced control engineering llc 
this acquisition also allowed the automation segment to expand its geographic reach and customer base to include specialty chemicals and pulp and paper markets 
the remainder of the increase is due to new work acquired as a result of our increased sales effort 
unlike our other segments  our automation segment is currently benefiting from greater capital spending on international downstream projects 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of the overall increase in our automation segment s revenue from to  approximately million was a result of the hurricane ike rebuilding project 
the automation segment s estimated backlog at december  was million  but the backlog could be negatively impacted by the current and possible future economic conditions 
gross profit the overall increase in our automation segment s gross profit from to is entirely attributable to increased revenues 
of the total gross profit percentage decrease  percentage points were attributable to indirect costs associated with salaries and employee related expenses as a percentage of revenue being higher than the comparable prior year period  while the remainder of the decrease is due to higher direct costs  as a percentage of revenue 
of the total gross profit percentage increase from to  percentage points were attributable to indirect costs associated with salaries and employee related expenses as a percentage of revenue being lower than the comparable prior year period  while the remainder of the increase is due to lower direct costs  as a percentage of revenue  associated with more efficiently managing projects 
in  an unanticipated shortage of available experienced labor caused an increase in labor hourly rates 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the overall increase in our automation segment s sg a expense from to was attributable to increases of  in depreciation and amortization expenses   in facilities expenses due to the relocation of the houston manufacturing facility   in salaries and employee related expenses and the remainder in professional services expense offset by savings in bad debt of  the overall increase in our automation segment s sg a expense from to was mainly due to increases in allowances for bad debt of  facilities expense of  and stock compensation expense of  these increases were offset by savings in amortization and depreciation expense of  due to the goodwill impairment of  that was taken in in   of amortization was recorded in connection with the intangible assets created from the acquisition of advance control engineering  llc and additional savings of  was recognized in professional services 
operating income the overall increases in our automation segment s operating income for both and are mainly due to the increased levels of work along with the better project management

in  a general increase in capital spending by our clients contributed to the increase in land segment revenue as compared to its revenue 
we were also able to increase our client base in the land segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
however  the backlog may be negatively impacted by current and possible future economic conditions 
gross profit due to current economic conditions  we are experiencing client demands for lower costs 
as a result  some of our contracts provide lower margins than we have earned in the past 
this trend is adversely affecting gross profit in our land segment 
del 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of the overall decrease in our land segment s gross profit from to  million was attributable to increased costs  while decreased revenues contributed to million of the decrease 
lower margins resulting from competitive pressures account for approximately of the gross profit decrease 
the remaining decrease is attributable to increased non billable and indirect costs associated with compensating employees who are between projects 
the overall increase in gross profit from to is attributed to the ability to renegotiate our existing contracts to cover our increased costs 
also  as a percent of revenue  gross profit increased by from in to in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the overall decrease in our land segment s sg a expense for was attributable to decreases of  in marketing expenses   in incentive bonus accruals for cancelled or modified plans and  in salaries and employee related expenses offset by an increase in bad debt expense of  the overall increase in our land segment s sg a expense for was primarily due to increases of  in salaries and related employee expenses   in allowance for bad debt  and  in marketing expenses with the remainder of the increase occurring in facilities  professional and insurance expense 
operating income the overall million decrease in our land segment s operating income for  as compared to  was due to the delayed and canceled work as well as increased costs due to competitive pressures 
the overall million increase in our land segment s operating income for  as compared to  was due to the increased sales volume as well as better negotiations on contract terms 
liquidity and capital resources overview the company defines liquidity as its ability to pay liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations 
our primary source of liquidity at december  was borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  discussed under senior revolving credit facility below the wells fargo credit facility 
cash on hand at december  totaled  and availability under the wells fargo credit facility totaled million resulting in total liquidity of million 
we believe that we have sufficient available cash required for operations for the next months 
however  cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if i revenues decline as a result of the decline in the price of oil or other economic factors  ii amounts billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner  iii circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices  iv project mix shifts from cost reimbursable to fixed price contracts during significant periods of growth  v the company loses one or more of its major customers  vi the company experiences cost overruns on fixed price contracts  vii our client mix shifts from our historical owner operator client base to more developer based clients  viii future acquisitions are not integrated timely  or ix we are not able to meet the covenants of the wells fargo credit facility 
if any such event occurs  we would be forced to consider alternative financing options 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash flows from operating activities operating activities provided million and million in net cash in and respectively but required the use of million in net cash in for the year ended december   the changes in working capital were primarily due to the decreased trade receivables of million  decreased accounts payable of million and decreased accrued compensation and benefits of million 
the decrease in trade receivables was primarily the result of an overall decline in operating activity 
our days sales outstanding has decreased from days for the twelve month period ended december  to days for the twelve month period ended december  in june  million of accounts receivable were reclassified to a current note receivable based upon a letter agreement with a significant client 
therefore  the remaining amount on the current note receivable of million is no longer included in our days sales outstanding calculation 
the company manages its billing and client collection processes toward reducing days sales outstanding to the extent practicable 
we believe that our allowance for bad debt is adequate to cover any potential non payment by our customers 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily the result of payouts of vendor and subcontractor charges incurred by our automation segment due to the increased activity during the three months ended december   payments of million in subcontractor obligations related to a note receivable and the overall decline in operating activity 
the decrease in accrued compensation and benefits was primarily due to timing of bi weekly payroll 
in  the note receivable re classification on the sle project was related to the client s obligation in the principal amount of million 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used cash totaling million in  compared to million in and million in in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions and the investment made to acquire the operations of pci 
in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions and the investment made to acquire ace 
in  our investing activities consisted of capital additions primarily for computers and technical software applications 
future investing activities are anticipated to remain consistent with prior years and include capital additions for leasehold improvements  technical applications software  and equipment  such as upgrades to computers 
the wells fargo credit facility discussed under senior revolving credit facility below limits annual capital expenditures to million 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities used cash totaling million and million in and  respectively  but provided cash totaling million in during  our primary financing mechanism was our line of credit under the comerica credit facility 
the line of credit was used principally to finance working capital requirements 
during  our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
during  our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
on december   the comerica credit facility was replaced by the wells fargo credit facility 
our borrowings on the new line of credit were million in the aggregate for we anticipate that future cash flows from financing activities will be borrowings  payments on the line of credit and payments on long term debt instruments 
line of credit fluctuations are a function of timing related to operations  obligations and payments received on accounts receivable 
we estimate that payments on long term debt  including interest for the coming year  will be million 
senior revolving credit facility historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
during december  the company entered into a new credit agreement with wells fargo bank  which provides a twenty eight month  million senior secured revolving credit facility wells item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fargo credit facility 
the wells fargo credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of company s subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  and positions wells fargo as senior to all other debt 
the wells fargo facility replaced a million senior revolving credit facility with comerica bank that would have expired in august the outstanding balance on the wells fargo credit facility as of december  was million at a fluctuating rate per terms of the wells fargo credit facility 
the remaining borrowings available under the wells fargo credit facility as of december  were million after consideration of loan covenant restrictions 
at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the wells fargo credit facility will bear interest at either a fluctuating rate per annum two percent above the daily one month libor rate in effect from time to time or a fixed rate per annum determined by wells fargo to be two percent above libor in effect on the first day of an applicable fixed rate term 
the wells fargo credit facility includes a commitment fee of basis points for the unused portion of the million credit facility 
at any time any portion of the debt under the wells fargo credit facility bears interest determined in relation to libor for a fixed rate term  it may be continued by the company at the end of the fixed rate term applicable thereto so that all or a portion thereof bears interest determined in relation to the daily one month libor rate or to libor for a new fixed rate term designated by the company 
the company s credit facility requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants as of the end of each calendar quarter  including the following o total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not greater than to  o asset coverage ratio not less than to  and o fixed charge coverage ratio not less than to  total liabilities is defined as the aggregate of current liabilities and non current liabilities 
tangible net worth is defined as the aggregate of total stockholders equity less any intangible assets and less any loans or advances to  or investments in  any related entities or individuals 
asset coverage ratio is defined as accounts receivable divided by revolver balance 
fixed charge coverage ratio is determined on a rolling four quarter basis and is defined as ebitda minus cash taxes  divided by interest expense  plus the current maturity of long term debt  where ebitda is net income  plus interest expense  plus income taxes  plus depreciation and amortization  plus stock compensation expense 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december  during the previous quarterly reporting period our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio ranged from to  our asset coverage ratio ranged from to  and our fixed charge ratio ranged from to 
during the twelve month period ended december  we expended or committed approximately  or million  of the million fiscal year covenant limitation on capital expenditures 
our office expansion in beaumont and the relocation of our manufacturing facility in houston account for million and million respectively in leasehold and equipment costs 
the million balance of our capital expenditures for the twelve month period has been for normal operating requirements including office furniture  computers  software and vehicles 
for the quarterly period ended december  our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio and asset coverage ratio covenant levels improved over their respective average ratios for the three previous quarterly periods 
the company s fixed charge coverage ratio for the quarterly period ended december  declined from the average ratio of the three previous quarterly periods 
the wells fargo credit facility also contains covenants that place certain limitations on the company including limits on capital expenditures  other indebtedness  mergers  asset sales  investments  guaranties  restrictions on certain distributions and pledges of assets 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the wells fargo credit facility as of december  caption 
del item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued letters of credit as of december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling  primarily to cover self insured deductibles under both our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
long term debt our total long term debt outstanding on december  was million see note to consolidated financial statements  a decrease from million as of december  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period and thereafter total in thousands long term debt   capital lease contractual interest and discount on certain notes subtotal long term debt    operating leases       total contractual cash obligations       future interest consists primarily of interest on the line of credit under the wells fargo credit facility 
the rate applicable to debt outstanding at december  was and fluctuates with the prime rate 
interest and discount rates on the remainder of the company s notes payable vary from to  with the weighted average being at december  non cash transactions in  non cash transactions included million discounted notes payable in connection with the acquisition of pci s operations 
in  non cash transactions included million discounted notes payable issued in connection with the acquisition of ace 
in  non cash transactions included a million note receivable issued upon the sale of a building the company owned in baton rouge  louisiana and a note receivable in the principal amount of million issued to south louisiana ethanol sle and evidenced by a hand note 
to see details of the hand note  see exhibits  and filed with the k 
we also acquired insurance with notes payable of million and million in and  respectively 
derivative financial instruments we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
long term notes receivable in the first quarter of  englobal engineering  inc eei and south louisiana ethanol  llc sle executed an agreement for epc services relating to the retro fit of an ethanol plant in southern louisiana 
the history of the sle project the project is described in note to the company s financial statements included in its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  after funding certain initial stages of the project with cash  sle obtained temporary financing from its bridge lending bank in the amount of million until it could obtain permanent financing for the project 
the parties anticipated that permanent financing would be obtained from other lenders no del 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued later than august  sle had engaged a major commercial bank to assist with finding permanent financing 
further  sle informed eei that this commercial bank had obtained permanent financing for numerous other ethanol facilities 
based on this  as well as on conversations between the company s chief executive officer and representatives of this commercial bank  eei expected the financing for the project to be consummated on a timely basis 
given this expectation  together with the favorable prices for corn and for ethanol  and the robust credit markets  eei believed that the project would be successful and commenced work in the fourth quarter of in the late summer of  although sle was current in its payments it had not obtained permanent financing  corn prices began to increase and ethanol prices began to decline 
accordingly the company decided that it was advisable to obtain security for the amount due 
on august   sle executed a collateral mortgage  a collateral note  and a promissory note in the amount of up to million  securing payment of the amount due  and the company re classed the amounts receivable from sle to a note receivable 
in connection with this promissory note  and as provided for under louisiana law  sle executed another promissory note the hand note on or about october  the hand note had a principal balance of approximately million  constituting all amounts then due 
sle was current on all invoices through september  however  on september   sle requested that eei immediately demobilize its activity and instruct its subcontractors to do the same 
eei complied with this request 
because collectability was not assured  the company reserved the amounts which were in excess of the hand note 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a valuation reserve and subsequent charge against bad debt expense in the amount of million to reduce the book value of the note receivable 
in the fourth quarter of  the company increased the valuation reserve and subsequent charge against bad debt expense in the amount of  as of december   the company performed its impairment analysis for the asset group classified as long term notes receivable  particularly notes receivable south louisiana ethanol  of million 
in august  sle filed for chapter protection in the us bankruptcy court in new orleans 
due to the ongoing discovery and analysis currently in process on our sle litigation we cannot yet determine the actual proceeds that would be generated for englobal when the courts determine the status of each asset and the relative lien priorities of sle s creditor s  and then such assets are sold 
however  at this time management believes that  given the company s lien position as documented in public records  the value of the collateral will cover the current balance sheet exposure 
any additional charge  or negative determination by the courts  could have a negative impact on future earnings estimated at cents per share per million of un recovered exposure as a result of a non cash charge to operations 
however  at this time the company believes that the ultimate disposition of the sle collateral will not materially adversely affect our liquidity or overall financial position 
the company will continue to evaluate the sle situation and  if required in the future  make adjustments to the reserve as necessary to remain in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles 
on march   the company entered into a letter agreement the letter agreement with alon usa  lp alon resolving the payment of due and past due accounts receivable invoices in the aggregate amount of million 
the principal terms of the letter agreement include the recovery of amounts due in monthly payments beginning in march and ending with final payment in december the million payment plan included million in subcontractor obligations which are included in our accounts payable balances 
the company received all scheduled payments from march through september  but did not receive the full amount of the scheduled  monthly payment due on october   nor did the company receive what would have been the final payments scheduled per the letter agreement during the months of november and december 
instead  alon notified the company that it had a claim against the company relating to a separate  completed project  in the amount of the balance due under the letter agreement and further  that it was offsetting the amount of its claim against the amount it owed the company under the letter agreement 
as of december   the company s note and its subcontractor obligations were million and million respectively 
the company had previously filed a materialman s and mechanic s lien on february   from the facts determinable at present  we believe all amounts are collectible but  due to the legal claim  we have reclassified this note from current to long term 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contingent liabilities and commitments to our knowledge  the company is not exposed to any environmental liability 
the company does not have any product liability issues 
lease commitments are included in footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
the company leases all of its office space 
the company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
income tax provision on july   the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and related implementation issues  which is now codified under asc  income taxes 
this standard provides guidance on the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
under asc  financial statements should reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
this interpretation also revises the disclosure requirements and was adopted by the company effective as of january  there are currently no material tax positions identified as uncertain for the company or its subsidiaries 
we recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in governmental penalties 
as of december   we have not recognized interest or penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions 
the company is subject to federal and state income tax audits from time to time that could result in proposed assessments 
the company cannot predict with certainty the timing of such audits  how these audits would be resolved and whether the company would be required to make additional tax payments  which may or may not include penalties and interest 
the company is not currently the subject of any examination by the internal revenue service  and the open years subject to audit are tax years for most states where the company conducts business  the company is subject to examination for the preceding three to six years 
asset management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable decreased to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding for trade accounts receivable decreased from days at december   to days at december  in june  million of accounts receivable were reclassified to a current note receivable based upon a letter agreement with a significant client 
therefore  the remaining amount on the current note receivable of million is no longer included in our days sales outstanding calculation 
this reclassification affected the days sales outstanding by three days 
the remaining reduction was due to improved billing and collection processes 
bad debt expense was approximately and of revenue for the years ended december  and we decreased our allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million or and of trade accounts receivable balance for each of the years and  respectively 
while we continue to manage this portion of our business very carefully  it is possible that our days sales outstanding  bad debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts will deteriorate if the economy continues to decline 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially face liability for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the sole or concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for services and capital expenditures during the year 
the annual budgeting and approval process under which these clients operate is normally not completed until after the beginning of each year  which can depress results for the first quarter 
principally due to these factors  our first and fourth quarters may be less robust than our second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition because the majority of the company s revenue is recognized under cost plus contracts  significant estimates are generally not involved in determining revenue recognition 
most of our contracts are with fortune companies 
as a result  collection risk is generally not a relevant factor in the recognition of revenue 
however  timing of accounts receivable collections could have a serious impact in the company s liquidity 
also  the company is engaging in more development contracts with smaller companies 
we anticipate that collection risk will be greater on these projects and have instituted new policies relating to ascertaining the creditworthiness of new customers 
it is not clear how changes in the economy will impact smaller companies ability to undertake and finance these projects 
our revenue is largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts 
some contracts have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
the contract is awarded with the maximum aggregate revenue  referred to as the not to exceed amount 
the company does not earn revenue over the not to exceed amount unless we obtain a change order 
the company is not obligated to complete the contract once the not to exceed amount has been reached 
however  if the company performs work over the not to exceed amount prior to obtaining a valid change order  it could impact our gross profit margins 
billings on time and material contracts are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition for construction type contracts  revenue and cost for these types of purchases are not included in total revenue and cost 
for financial reporting this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
during  pass through transactions totaled million 
we had no pass through transactions in and profits and losses on fixed price contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs for each contract 
contract costs include amounts paid for materials  equipment and subcontractors 
anticipated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed price contracts 
the company s inability to manage significant levels or increases in costs and estimated earning in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts could have a serious impact on the company s cash flow 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on fixed price contracts 
change orders change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change deliverables under a contract without adding new provisions 
either we or our clients may initiate change orders 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  manner of performance  equipment  materials  scope of work  and or the period of completion of the project 
change orders occur when changes are experienced once a contract is begun 
change orders are sometimes documented and in most cases the terms of change orders are agreed upon with the client before the work is performed 
other times  circumstances may require that work progress without the client s written agreement before the work is performed 
in those cases  we are taking a risk that the customer will not sign a change order or at a later time the customer will seek to negotiate the pricing of the additional work 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is more likely than not that the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be reliably estimated 
we have a favorable history of negotiating and collecting for work performed under change orders and our bi weekly billing cycle has proven to be timely enough to properly account for change orders 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual analysis as of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment calculations are components one level below our reportable operating segments 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in step of the goodwill impairment test  the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
in step  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  including goodwill  then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions including determination of an appropriate discount rate  projecting revenue growth and gross margins  estimating operating and interest expense and projecting capital expenditure levels are involved in making these fair value estimates  with the most critical estimates being projected growth rate and discount rate 
the projected growth rate incorporates the company s budget and management s estimate of the long term growth rate of the company based on certain internal estimates and external data 
the discount rate utilized in the analysis was a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
wacc is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise  with the weighting of returns based on the capitalization of comparable companies 
while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow projections and wacc assumptions  actual future cash flows  costs of capital or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment and charges related to recorded goodwill balances 
our methodologies for performing our goodwill impairment analysis have not changed from the prior year 
however  we did incorporate changes relating to growth rate in response to current economic condition 
the discount rate increased approximately for the current year analysis 
except for automation  the fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued carrying value 
the fair value for automation  which has million of goodwill recorded as of december   exceeded carrying value by 
deterioration in our expected operating results or increases in our cost of capital could have a negative effect on fair value and lead to an impairment in the future 
a decrease in our projected growth rate holding all other assumptions constant would have the following impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  summarized by segment engineering million construction million automation million land million these hypothetical changes would not cause step of the goodwill impairment test to be required for any of our reporting units 
a increase in our assumed discount rate holding all other assumptions constant would have the following impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  summarized by segment engineering million construction million automation million land million these hypothetical changes would not cause step of the goodwill impairment test to be required for the reporting units within the engineering  construction or land segments 
however  step of the goodwill impairment test would be required for the automation segment 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis for the years ended december  and december  indicated no impairment to the recorded value of our goodwill assets 
the company recognized  of impairment in our automation segment in if the economic downturn causes the value of one or more of the company s subsidiaries to decline  the company might have goodwill impairment in future years 
deferred tax the company had net deferred tax asset balances of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
these net deferred tax assets are identified in footnote to the financial statements 
the company had a federal net operating loss carry forward at december  of approximately  earlier utilization of the net operating loss on the company s and consolidated tax returns was disallowed by the irs which resulted in a reinstated carry forward that will be available for utilization from through the company also has a foreign net operating loss carry forward at december  of approximately million 
this loss is available for utilization from through  however  application of the net operating loss is restricted to the income of englobal canada 
the company is unsure of its ability to fully utilize the foreign net operating loss 
therefore  the company has set up a valuation allowance of  against the entire net operating loss 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   the fasb issued the authoritative version of the accounting standards codification tm codification or asc as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the codification was effective for interim and annual periods ended after september  and all previous level a d us gaap standards issued by a standard setter are superseded 
the company has adopted the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued provisions of the codification with its reporting period ended september  adoption of the new guidance did not materially impact the company s financial statements 
on may   the fasb issued fas  subsequent events  now codified as asc  subsequent events  which provides guidance on management s assessment of subsequent events 
historically  management had relied on us auditing literature for guidance on assessing and disclosing subsequent events 
asc represents the inclusion of guidance on subsequent events in the accounting literature and is directed specifically to management  since management is responsible for preparing an entity s financial statements 
asc clarifies that management must evaluate  as of each reporting period  events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date through the date that the financial statements are issued 
asc was effective prospectively for interim and annual financial periods ending after june  the company has adopted the provisions of asc effective with its reporting period ending june  the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has evaluated subsequent events up through the date of the filing of this report with the sec 
in december  the fasb issued fas r  business combinations  now codified as asc  business combinations 
asc significantly changes the accounting for business combinations 
under asc  an acquiring entity is required to recognize  with limited exceptions  all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value 
asc changes the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items including  among other items expensing acquisition related costs as incurred  valuing non controlling interests at fair value at the acquisition date  and expensing restructuring costs associated with an acquired business 
asc also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
the company adopted the provisions of asc on january  the full impact to the company  which could be material  will be dependent upon any individual transactions consummated 
inflation and changing prices the company is planning to incorporate certain provisions in its future fixed price contracts that would allow the company to recover a portion of certain unforeseen price changes in materials and labor that are not in the range of normally expected inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under asc  financial instruments or asc  derivatives and hedging 
there are no material investments at december  accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its variable rate line of credit debt obligation  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
assuming a increase in the interest rate on this variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   to an average interest rate of  annual interest expense would have been approximately  higher in based on our annual average line of credit obligation 
due to the current credit market  a greater concern might be the impact of a material violation of certain financial covenants in our credit agreement resulting in a re pricing of that agreement 
this could not only result in the increased annual interest expense but also a renewal or origination fee of equal proportion on a similar credit agreement 
the company does not have any interest rate swap or exchange agreements 
the company has no market risk exposure in the areas of interest rate risk from investments because the company did not have an investment portfolio as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
transactions in canadian dollars in our canadian subsidiary have been translated into us dollars using the current rate method  such that assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange during the appropriate fiscal period 
as a result  the carrying value of the company s investments in canada is subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  any revenue received from the company s international operations in other than us dollars will be subject to foreign exchange risk 
the percentage of revenue received from foreign customers is identified in the discussion of segment revenue 
most revenue received from foreign customers is paid to the company in u 
s 
currency  except for revenue collected by our canadian subsidiaries 
the canadian dollar is not subject to volatile price fluctuations compared to the us dollar
