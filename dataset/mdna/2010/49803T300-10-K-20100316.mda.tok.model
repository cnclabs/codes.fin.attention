item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion of the current economic conditions and their impact on us 
significant activities financing and capital raising activities 
as discussed in more detail below in business objectives and strategies  our primary business objectives are to generate increasing cash flow  achieve long term growth and maximize shareholder value primarily through the operation  development  redevelopment and acquisition of well located community and neighborhood shopping centers 
however  as discussed in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  current economic and financial market conditions have created a need for most reits  including us  to place a significant amount of emphasis on our financing and capital preservation strategy 
therefo re  our primary objective recently has been  and in the future will continue to be  the strengthening of our balance sheet  managing of our debt maturities and conservation of cash 
we ended the year with approximately million of combined cash and borrowing capacity on the unsecured revolving credit facility and  as of february   have extended all of our debt maturities 
we will remain focused on refinancing activity and will continue to aggressively manage our operating portfolio 
during  we successfully completed various financing  refinancing and capital raising activities 
as a result of these actions  we reduced the amount outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility to million at december  from million at december  and paid down the balances of various other loans 
the significant financing  refinancing and capital raising activities completed during included the following new financings in permanent financing of million was placed on the eastgate pavilion operating property in cincinnati  ohio  a previously unencumbered property

we simultaneously hedged this loan to fix the interest rate at for the full term  the maturity date of the million variable rate loan on our tarpon springs plaza operating property in naples  florida was extended to january at an interest rate of libor basis points  and the maturity date of the million variable rate loan on our estero town commons operating property in naples  florida was extended to january at an interest rate of libor basis points 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we completed the following financing activities the maturity date of the million variable rate loan on the shops at rivers edge operating property in indianapolis  indiana was extended to february at an interest rate of libor basis points  the maturity date of the million variable rate construction loan on the cobblestone plaza development property was extended to february at an interest rate of libor basis points  and the maturity date of the million construction loan on the south elgin commons property in a suburb of chicago was extended to september at an interest rate of libor basis points 
construction financing draws totaling approximately million were made on the variable rate construction loan at the eddy street commons development project  and we used proceeds from our unsecured revolving credit facility  other borrowings and cash totaling approximately million for other development and redevelopment activities 
repayments of outstanding indebtedness we used approximately million of proceeds from our may common share offering to pay down the outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility  we repaid the million fixed rate loan on our boulevard crossing operating property in kokomo  indiana and contributed the related asset to the unsecured revolving credit facility collateral pool  and in addition  we partially paid down the balances of various permanent and construction loans in in connection with the extensions of their respective maturity dates 
the aggregate amount of such paydowns was million in other financing related activities we utilized our unsecured revolving credit facility to contribute approximately million of equity to our parkside town commons unconsolidated joint venture property in raleigh  north carolina 
our joint venture partner also made a contribution as a means to reduce the joint venture s outstanding variable rate debt  we placed an interest rate hedge on the million variable rate loan maturing in december on our glendale town center operating property in indianapolis  indiana 
this hedge fixed the interest rate at for the full term  and we placed an interest rate hedge on the million variable rate loan maturing in december on our bayport commons operating property in oldsmar  florida 
this hedge fixed the interest rate at for the full term  common equity offering in may  we completed an offering of  common shares at an offering price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were initially retained and a portion subsequently used to retire outstanding indebtedness as described above 
development and redevelopment activities in the second quarter of  we completed south elgin commons  phase i  a  square foot la fitness facility located in a suburb of chicago  illinois  and transitioned it into our operating portfolio  we partially completed the construction of cobblestone plaza  a  square foot neighborhood shopping center located in ft 
lauderdale  florida 
this property was leased or committed as of december  and is anchored by whole foods  staples  and party city  and we substantially completed the construction of the retail and office components of eddy street commons  phase i  a  square foot center located in south bend  indiana that includes a  square foot non owned multi family component 
this project was leased or committed as of december  and is anchored by follett bookstore and the university of notre dame 
no new development projects were commenced in as of december   we had a redevelopment pipeline that included five properties undergoing various stages of redevelopment bolton plaza  jacksonville  florida 
this  square foot neighborhood shopping center was previously anchored by wal mart 
we recently executed a  square foot lease with academy sports outdoors to anchor this center and expect this tenant to open during the second half of we currently estimate the cost of this redevelopment to be approximately million  coral springs plaza  boca raton  florida 
in early  circuit city declared bankruptcy and vacated this center 
we recently executed a  square foot lease with toys r us babies r us to occupy of this center 
we expect this tenant to open during the second half of we currently estimate the cost of this redevelopment to be approximately million  courthouse shadows  naples  florida 
in  we transferred this  square foot neighborhood shopping center from our operating portfolio to our redevelopment pipeline 
we intend to modify the existing facade and pylon signage and upgrade the landscaping and lighting 
in  publix purchased the lease of the former anchor tenant and made certain improvements on the space 
we currently anticipate our total investment in the redevelopment at courthouse shadows will be approximately million  four corner square  seattle  washington 
in  we transferred this  square foot neighborhood shopping center from our operating portfolio to our redevelopment pipeline 
in addition to the existing center  we also own an adjacent ten acres of land in our shadow pipeline that may be used as part of the redevelopment 
we currently estimate the cost of this redevelopment to be approximately million  and shops at rivers edge  indianapolis  indiana 
in  we purchased this  square foot neighborhood shopping center with the intent to redevelop it 
the current anchor tenant s lease at this property expires on march  the tenant may continue to occupy the space for a period of time while the company markets the space to several potential anchor tenants 
we currently estimate the cost of this redevelopment to be approximately million which may increase depending on the outcome of current negotiations with potential anchor tenants 
no new redevelopment projects were commenced in property dispositions in  as part of our regular quarterly review  we determined that it was appropriate to write off the net book value on the galleria plaza operating property in dallas  texas and recognize a non cash impairment charge of million 
our estimated future cash flows  which considered recent negative property specific events  were anticipated to be insufficient to recover the carrying value due to significant ground lease obligations and expected future required capital expenditures 
we conveyed the title to the property to the ground lessor in the fourth quarter of cash distributions in  we declared quarterly per share cash distributions for the following periods first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter paid in january full year business objectives and strategies our primary business objectives are to increase the cash flow and consequently the value of our properties  achieve sustainable long term growth and maximize shareholder value primarily through the operation  development  redevelopment and select acquisition of well located community and neighborhood shopping centers 
we invest in properties where cost effective renovation and expansion programs  combined with effective leasing and management strategies  can combine to improve the long term values and economic returns of our properties 
the company believes that certain of its properties represent opportunities for future renovation and expansion 
we seek to implement our business objectives through the following strategies  each of which is more completely described in the sections that follow operating strategy maximizing the internal growth in revenue from our operating properties by leasing and re leasing those properties to a diverse group of retail tenants at increasing rental rates  when possible  and redeveloping certain properties to make them more attractive to existing and prospective tenants or to permit additional or more productive uses of the properties  growth strategy using debt and equity capital prudently to redevelop or renovate our existing properties and to selectively acquire and develop additional shopping centers on land parcels that we currently own where we project that investment returns would meet or exceed internal benchmarks for above average returns  and financing and capital preservation strategy financing our capital requirements with borrowings under our existing credit facility and newly issued secured debt  internally generated funds and proceeds from selling properties that no longer fit our strategy  investment in strategic joint ventures and by accessing the public securities markets when market conditions permit 
operating strategy 
our primary operating strategy is to maximize rents and maintain or increase occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse tenant base 
most of our properties are in regional and neighborhood trade areas with attractive demographics  which has allowed us to maintain and  in some cases  increase occupancy and rental rates 
we seek to implement our operating strategy by  among other things maintaining efficient leasing and property management strategies to emphasize and maximize rent growth and cost effective facilities  maintaining a diverse tenant mix in an effort to limit our exposure to the financial condition of any one tenant  maintaining strong tenant and retailer relationships in order to avoid rent interruptions and reduce marketing  leasing and tenant improvement costs that result from re tenanting space  maximizing the occupancy of our existing operating portfolio  increasing rental rates upon the renewal of expiring leases or re leasing space to new tenants while minimizing vacancy to the extent possible  and taking advantage of under utilized land or existing square footage  or reconfiguring properties for better use 
we employed our operating strategy in in a number of ways  including maintaining a diverse retail tenant mix with no tenant accounting for more than of our annualized base rent 
see item  properties for a list of our top tenants by gross leasable area and annualized base rent 
we also had a renewed focus on tenant leasing in and  as a part of that focus  we hired a new executive in april who has substantial industry experience and is dedicated to developing and managing our leasing strategy 
this new leasing executive implemented a number of key initiatives to strengthen our overall leasing program  resulting in the execution of  square feet of new and renewal leases during  which is the most square feet leased in a single year since we became a public company in growth strategy 
while we are focused on conserving capital in the current difficult economic environment  our growth strategy includes the selective deployment of resources to projects that are expected to generate investment returns that meet or exceed our expectations 
we intend to implement our investment strategy in a number of ways  including evaluating redevelopment and renovation opportunities that we believe will make our properties more attractive for leasing or re leasing to tenants at increased rental rates where possible  disposing of selected assets that no longer meet our long term investment criteria and recycling the capital into assets that provide maximum returns and upside potential in desirable markets  and selectively pursuing the acquisition of retail properties and portfolios in markets with attractive demographics which we believe can support retail development and therefore attract strong retail tenants 
in evaluating opportunities for potential development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition  we consider a number of factors  including the expected returns and related risks associated with investments in these potential opportunities relative to our combined cost of capital to make such investments  the current and projected cash flow and market value of the property  and the potential to increase cash flow and market value if the property were to be successfully redeveloped  the price being offered for the property  the current and projected operating performance of the property  the tax consequences of the sale and other related factors  the current tenant mix at the property and the potential future tenant mix that the demographics of the property could support  including the presence of one or more additional anchors for example  value retailers  grocers  soft goods stores  office supply stores  or sporting goods retailers  as well as an overall diverse tenant mix that includes restaurants  shoe and clothing retailers  specialty shops and service retailers such as banks  dry cleaners and hair salons  some of which provide staple goods to the community and offer a high level of convenience  the configuration of the property  including ease of access  abundance of parking  maximum visibility  and the demographics of the surrounding area  and the level of success of our existing properties  if any  in the same or nearby markets 
in  we were successful in executing leases for anchor tenants at two properties in our redevelopment portfolio 
we signed a lease for a  square foot combined toys r us babies r us to occupy of our coral springs property in boca raton  florida 
we also signed a lease for  square feet with academy sports outdoors to anchor our bolton plaza property in jacksonville  florida 
we expect both of these tenants to open for business during the last half of financing and capital preservation strategy 
we finance our development  redevelopment and acquisition activities seeking to use the most advantageous sources of capital available to us at the time 
these sources may include the sale of common or preferred equity through public offerings or private placements  the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings  investment in real estate joint ventures and the reinvestment of proceeds from the disposition of assets 
our primary finance and capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost effective way 
we consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings  including the purchase price of properties to be developed or acquired with debt financing  the estimated market value of our properties and our company as a whole upon consummation of the refinancing  and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service 
as discussed in more detail in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the current market conditions have created a necessity for most reits  including us  to pl ace a significant emphasis on financing and capital preservation strategies 
while these conditions continue  along with the current turmoil in the credit markets  our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet are essential to our business 
we intend to implement our financing and capital strategies in a number of ways  including prudently managing our balance sheet  including reducing the aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility so that we have additional capacity available to fund our development and redevelopment projects and pay down maturing debt if refinancing that debt is not feasible  seeking to extend the maturity dates of and or refinancing our unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan borrowings  which had a combined aggregate balance of million at december  and which both mature in our unsecured revolving credit facility has a one year extension option to february if we are in compliance with the covenants under the related agreement  managing our exposure to variable rate debt through the use of interest rate hedging transactions  entering into new project specific construction loans  property loans  and other borrowings  investing in joint venture arrangements in order to access less expensive capital and to mitigate risk  and raising additional capital through the issuance of common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
in  we implemented our financing and capital strategy in a number of ways  including issuing  common shares at an offering price of per common share for net proceeds of million 
the majority of the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and pay down other forms of indebtedness 
in addition  as discussed above in significant activities  we have extended or refinanced all of our and debt maturities 
we were also able to reduce the amount outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility to million  net of additional borrowings  at december  from million at december  business segments our principal business is the ownership  operation  acquisition  development and construction of high quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the united states 
we have aligned our operations into two business segments real estate operation and development  and construction and advisory services 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on our two business segments and the reconciliation of total segment revenues to total revenues  total segment operating income to operating income  total segment net income to consolidated net income  and total segment assets to total assets for the years ended december   and competition the united states commercial real estate market continues to be highly competitive 
we face competition from institutional investors  other reits  and owner operators engaged in the development  acquisition  ownership and leasing of shopping centers as well as from numerous local  regional and national real estate developers and owners in each of our markets 
some of our competitors may have more resources than we do 
we face significant competition in our efforts to lease available space to prospective tenants at our operating  development and redevelopment properties 
generally  the challenging economic conditions have caused a greater than normal amount of space to be available for lease 
the nature of the competition for tenants varies depending upon the characteristics of each local market in which we own and manage properties 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location  demographics  rental rates  the presence of anchor stores  competitor shopping centers in the same geographic area and the maintenance and appearance of our properties 
there can be no assurance in the future that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors in our development  acquisition and leasing activities 
government regulation americans with disabilities act 
our properties must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
we believe our properties are in substantial compliance with the ada and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ada 
however  noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the obligation to make readily accessible accommodations is an ongoing one  and we will continue to asse ss our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect 
environmental regulations 
some properties in our portfolio contain  may have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks for petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations may have released  or have the potential to release  such substances into the environment 
in addition  some of our properties have tenants which may use hazardous or toxic substances in the routine course of their businesses 
in general  these tenants have covenanted in their leases with us to use these substances  if any  in compliance with all environmental laws and have agreed to indemnify us for any damages we may suffer as a result of their use of such substances 
however  these lease provisions may not fully protect us in the event that a tenant becomes insolvent 
finally  one of our properties has contained asbestos containing building materials  or acbm  and another property may have contained such materials based on the date of its construction 
environmental laws require that acbm be properly managed and maintained  and fines and penalties may be imposed on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
the laws also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
we are not currently aware of any environmental issues that may materially affect the operation of any of our properties 
insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage  and rental loss insurance that covers all properties in our portfolio 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss  the cost of the coverage  and industry practice 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable losses such as loss from riots  war or acts of god  and  in some cases  flooding 
some of our policies  such as those covering losses due to terrorism and floods  are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses

meridian street  suite  indianapolis  in our telephone number is employees as of december   we had full time employees 
of these employees  were home office executive and administrative personnel and were on site construction  facilities management and maintenance personnel

item a 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
these factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows  and you should carefully consider them 
it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
we have separated the risks into three categories risks related to our operations  risks related to our organization and structure  and risks related to tax matters 
risks related to our operations ongoing challenging conditions in the united states and global economy  the challenges being faced by our retail tenants and non owned anchor tenants and the decrease in demand for retail space may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are susceptible to adverse economic developments in the united states 
the economy of the united states continued to be very challenged during and early  and these conditions may persist into the future 
there can be no assurance that government responses to disruptions in the economy and in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence 
general economic factors that are beyond our control  including  but not limited to  recessions  decreases in consumer confidence  reductions in consumer credit availability  increasing consumer debt levels  rising energy costs  tax rates  continued business layoffs  downsizing and industry slowdowns  and or rising inflation  could have a negative impact on the business of our retail tenants 
in turn  this could have a material adverse effect on our business because current or prospective tenants may  among other things i have difficulty paying us rent as they struggle to sell goods and services to consumers  ii be unwilling to enter into or renew leases with us on favorable terms or at all  iii seek to terminate their existing leases with us or seek downward rental adjustment to such leases  or iv be forced to curtail operations or declare bankruptcy 
we are also susceptible to other developments that  while not directly tied to the economy  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these developments include relocations of businesses  changing demographics  increased internet shopping  infrastructure quality  state budgetary constraints and priorities  increases in real estate and other taxes  costs of complying with government regulations or increased regulation  decreasing valuations of real estate  and other factors 
in addition  because our portfolio of properties consists primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers  a decrease in the demand for retail space  due to the economic factors discussed above or otherwise  may have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
the market for retail space has been  and could continue to be  adversely affected by weakness in the national  regional and local economies  the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies  the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector  the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets  and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues or the internet 
to the extent that any of these conditions occur  they are likely to negatively affect market rents for retail space and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders 
further  we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our real estate assets may not be recoverable 
the ongoing challenging market conditions could require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to one or more of our properties 
for example  in the third quarter of  we determined to write off the net book value on the galleria plaza operating property in dallas  texas  and recognized a non cash impairment charge of million 
because of our geographical concentration in indiana  florida and texas  a prolonged economic downturn in these states could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the united states economy was in a recession during  and challenging economic conditions have continued into similarly  the specific markets in which we operate continue to face very challenging economic conditions that will likely persist into the future 
in particular  as of december   approximately of our owned square footage and approximately of our total annualized base rent is located in indiana  approximately of our owned square footage and approximately of our total annualized base rent is located in florida  and approximately of our owned square footage and approximately of our total annualized base rent is located in texas 
this level of concentration could expose us to greater economic risks than if we owned properties in numerous geographic regions 
many states continue to deal with state fiscal budget shortfalls  rising unemployment rates and home foreclosure rates 
continued adverse economic or real estate trends in indiana  florida  texas  or the surrounding regions  or any continued decrease in demand for retail space resulting from the local regulatory environment  business climate or fiscal problems in these states  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders 
ongoing disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing for development of our properties and other purposes on reasonable terms  or at all  and have other material adverse effects on our business 
over the last few years  the united states financial and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many financial instruments to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing 
continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms  or at all  which may materially adversely affect our business 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain permanent financing on development projects we financed with construction loans or mezzanine debt 
our inability to obtain such permanent financing on favorable terms  if at all  could delay the completion of our development projects and or cause us to incur additional capital costs in connection with completing such projects  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  if we are not successful in refinancing our outstanding debt when it becomes due  we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock 
the disruptions in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and have other adverse effects on our business 
if our tenants are unable to secure financing necessary to continue to operate their businesses and pay us rent  we could be materially and adversely affected 
many of our tenants rely on external sources of financing to operate their businesses 
as discussed above  the united states financial and credit markets continue to experience significant liquidity disruptions  resulting in the unavailability of financing for many businesses 
if our tenants are unable to secure financing necessary to continue to operate their businesses  they may be unable to meet their rent obligations to us or enter into new leases with us or be forced to declare bankruptcy and reject our leases  which could materially and adversely affect us 
we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness outstanding as of december   which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund our growth 
required repayments of debt and related interest may materially adversely affect our operating performance 
we had approximately million of consolidated outstanding indebtedness as of december  approximately million of this debt is scheduled to mature in at december   approximately million of our debt bore interest at variable rates approximately million when reduced by our million of interest rate swaps for fixed interest rates 
interest rates are currently low relative to historical levels and may increase significantly in the future 
if our interest expense increased significantly  it could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december  increased by  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future cash flows by approximately million annually 
we also intend to incur additional debt in connection with projects in our current development  redevelopment and shadow development pipelines  as well as with acquisitions of properties 
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
we may borrow new funds to develop or acquire properties 
in addition  we may incur or increase our mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by some or all of the real estate properties we develop or acquire 
we also may borrow funds if necessary to satisfy the requirement that we distribute to shareholders at least of our annual reit taxable income  or otherwise as is necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or otherwise avoid paying taxes that can be eliminated through distributions to our shareholders 
our substantial debt could materially and adversely affect our business in other ways  including by  among other things requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to pay principal and interest  which reduces the amount available for distributions  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limiting our ability to borrow more money for operating or capital needs or to finance acquisitions in the future 
agreements with lenders supporting our unsecured revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan and various other loan agreements contain default provisions which  among other things  could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments or the termination of the facilities 
our unsecured revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan and various other debt agreements contain certain events of default which include  but are not limited to  failure to make principal or interest payments when due  failure to perform or observe any term  covenant or condition contained in the agreements  failure to maintain certain financial and operating ratios and other criteria  misrepresentations and bankruptcy proceedings 
in the event of a default under any of these agreements  the lender would have various rights including  but not limited to  the ability to require the acceleration of the payment of all principal and interest due and or to terminate the agreements  and to foreclose on the properties 
the declaration of a default and or the accelerati on of the amount due under any such credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  certain of our permanent and construction loans contain cross default provisions which provide that a violation by the company of any financial covenant set forth in our unsecured revolving credit facility agreement will constitute an event of default under the loans  which could allow the lending institutions to accelerate the amount due under the loans 
mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure  which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt 
as of december   a significant amount of our indebtedness was secured by our real estate assets 
if a property or group of properties is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage or lender could foreclose on the property  resulting in the loss of our investment 
also  certain of these mortgages contain customary covenants which  among other things  limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property  to enter into new leases or materially modify existing leases  and to discontinue insurance coverage 
we are subject to risks associated with hedging agreements 
we use a combination of interest rate protection agreements  including interest rate swaps and locks  to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility 
this may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
further  should we choose to terminate a hedging agreement  there could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our initial obligation under the hedging agreement 
our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate substantial revenues from our properties 
periods of economic slowdown or recession including the current challenging economic conditions  rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur  could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases 
such events would materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of our common shares and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  other events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties 
these events include adverse changes in the national  regional and local economic climate  particularly in indiana  where approximately of our owned square footage and of our total annualized base rent is located  florida  where approximately of our owned square footage and of our total annualized base rent is located  and texas  where approximately of our owned square footage and of our total annualized base rent is located  tenant bankruptcies  local oversupply  increased competition or reduction in demand for space  inability to collect rent from tenants  or having to provide significant tenant concessions  vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms  changes in market rental rates  inability to finance property development  tenant improvements and acquisitions on favorable terms  increased operating costs  including costs incurred for maintenance  insurance premiums  utilities and real estate taxes  the need to periodically fund the costs to repair  renovate and re let space  decreased attractiveness of our properties to tenants  weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather related expenses such as snow removal costs  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations  including those governing usage  zoning  the environment and taxes  civil unrest  acts of terrorism  earthquakes  hurricanes and other national disasters or acts of god that may result in underinsured or uninsured losses  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments  changing demographics  and changing traffic patterns 
failure by any major tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us  because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
our leases generally do not contain provisions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants 
at any time  our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition  particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as what we are currently experiencing 
as a result  our tenants may delay lease commencements  decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration  fail to make rental payments when due  close a number of stores or declare bankruptcy 
any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenant s leases a nd the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases 
in addition  lease terminations by a major tenant or non owned anchor or a failure by that major tenant or non owned anchor to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers because of contractual co tenancy termination or rent reduction rights under the terms of some leases 
in that event  we may be unable to re lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all 
the occurrence of any of the situations described above  particularly if it involves a substantial tenant or a non owned anchor with ground leases in multiple locations  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as of december   the five largest tenants in our operating portfolio in terms of annualized base rent were publix  petsmart  lowe s home improvement  ross stores and dick s sporting goods  representing     and  respe ctively  of our total annualized base rent 
we face potential material adverse effects from increasing numbers of tenant bankruptcies  and we may be unable to collect balances due from any tenant bankruptcy 
bankruptcy filings by our retail tenants occur from time to time 
such bankruptcies may increase in times of economic uncertainty such as what we are currently experiencing 
the number of bankruptcies among united states companies increased in and current economic conditions suggest this trend could continue 
similarly  bankruptcies of tenants renting space at properties in our portfolio continue to be well above historical levels 
we cannot make any assurance that any tenant who files for bankruptcy protection will continue to pay us rent 
a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant or the lease guarantor  or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases  and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims  and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected 
as a result  it is likely that we will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold from a tenant in bankruptcy 
we are continually re leasing vacant spaces resulting from tenant lease terminations 
the bankruptcy of a tenant  particularly an anchor tenant  may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties 
future tenant bankruptcies could materially adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re leasing strategy 
our financial covenants may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 
our unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  certain coverage ratios  as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt  make dividend payments  sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions 
these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions 
in addition  failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are closely monitoring all of our debt covenants 
maintaining our covenant compliance is an integral aspect of our capital decision making 
our current and future joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on joint venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 
as of december   we owned eight of our operating properties through joint ventures 
for the twelve months ended december   the eight properties represented approximately of our annualized base rent 
in addition  one of the properties and a component of another property in our current development pipeline and two properties in our shadow pipeline are currently owned through joint ventures  two of which are accounted for under the equity method as of december  as we do not exercise requisite control for consolidation treatment 
we have also entered into an agreement with prudential real estate investors to pursue joint venture opportunities for the development and selected acquisition of community shopping centers in the united states 
these joint ventures involve risks not present with respect t o our wholly owned properties  including the following we may share decision making authority with our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and the joint venture property  such as the sale of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property  which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners  prior consent of our joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture  which restricts our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture  our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture  our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the property that conflict with our business interests and goals  which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership  management or disposition of the property  disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture  which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and or trustees from focusing their time and effort on our business  and possibly disrupt the day to day operations of the property such as by delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved  and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments and the activities of a joint venture could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit  even though we may not control the joint venture 
in the future  we intend to co invest with third parties through joint ventures that may involve similar or additional risks 
we face significant competition  which may impede our ability to renew leases or re let space as leases expire  require us to undertake unbudgeted capital improvements  or impede our ability to make future developments or acquisitions or increase the cost of these developments or acquisitions 
we compete with numerous developers  owners and operators of retail shopping centers for tenants 
these competitors include institutional investors  other reits and other owner operators of community and neighborhood shopping centers  some of which own or may in the future own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located  but which have greater capital resources 
if our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates  or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants  we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants leases expire 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  trading price of our common shares and ability to sati sfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders may be materially adversely affected 
as of december   leases were scheduled to expire on a total of approximately of the space at our properties in in addition  increased competition for tenants may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise planned to make 
any unbudgeted capital improvements we undertake may reduce cash available for distributions to shareholders 
our future developments and acquisitions may not yield the returns we expect or may result in shareholder dilution 
we have two properties in our current development pipeline and six properties in our shadow pipeline 
new developments and acquisitions are subject to a number of risks  including  but not limited to abandonment of development activities after expending resources to determine feasibility  construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition  and any representations we may receive from the seller  may fail to reveal various liabilities or defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired  which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition costs  financing risks  the failure to meet anticipated occupancy or rent levels  failure to receive required zoning  occupancy  land use and other governmental permits and authorizations and changes in applicable zoning and land use laws  and the consent of third parties such as tenants  mortgage lenders and joint venture partners may be required  and those consents may be difficult to obtain or be withheld 
in addition  if a project is delayed or if we are unable to lease designated space to anchor tenants  certain tenants may have the right to terminate their leases 
if any of these situations occur  development costs for a project will increase  which will result in reduced returns  or even losses  from such investments 
in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property  we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property 
if these new properties do not perform as expected  our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the issuance of equity securities as consideration for any acquisitions could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisitions or development and redevelopment projects that meet our investment criteria  which may impede our growth 
part of our business strategy is expansion through acquisitions and development and redevelopment projects  which requires us to identify suitable development or acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties or other assets that meet our development or acquisition criteria  or we may fail to complete developments  acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms 
failure to identify or complete developments or acquisitions could slow our growth  which could in turn materially adversely affect our operations 
redevelopment activities may be delayed or otherwise may not perform as expected and  in the case of an unsuccessful redevelopment project  our entire investment could be at risk for loss 
we currently have five properties in our redevelopment pipeline 
we expect to redevelop certain of our other properties in the future 
in connection with any redevelopment of our properties  we will bear certain risks  including the risk of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs and make a project uneconomical  the risk that occupancy or rental rates at a completed project will not be sufficient to enable us to pay operating expenses or earn the targeted rate of return on investment  and the risk of incurrence of predevelopment costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion 
in addition  various tenants may have the right to withdraw from a property if a development and or redevelopment project is not completed on time 
in the case of a redevelopment project  consents may be required from various tenants in order to redevelop a center 
in the case of an unsuccessful redevelopment project  our entire investment could be at risk for loss 
we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate and could  under certain circumstances  be required to pay certain tax indemnities related to the properties we sell 
real estate property investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
in connection with our formation at the time of our ipo  we entered into an agreement that restricts our ability  prior to december   to dispose of six of our properties in taxable transactions and limits the amount of gain we can trigger with respect to certain other properties without incurring reimbursement obligations owed to certain limited partners of our operating partnership 
we have agreed that if we dispose of any interest in six specified properties in a taxable transaction before december   we will indemnify the contributors of those properties for their tax liabilities attributable to the built in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our ipo and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reim bursement payment 
the six properties to which our tax indemnity obligations relate represented approximately of our annualized base rent in the aggregate as of december  these six properties are international speedway square  shops at eagle creek  whitehall pike  ridge plaza shopping center  thirty south and market street village 
we also agreed to limit the aggregate gain certain limited partners of our operating partnership would recognize  with respect to certain other contributed properties through december   to not more than million in total  with certain annual limits  unless we reimburse them for the taxes attributable to the excess gain and any taxes imposed on the reimbursement payments  and take certain other steps to help them avoid incurring taxes that were deferred in connection with the formation transactions 
the agreement described above is extremely complicated and imposes a number of procedural requirements on us  which makes it more difficult for us to ensure that we comply with all of the various terms of the agreement and therefore creates a greater risk that we may be required to make an indemnity payment 
the complicated nature of this agreement also might adversely impact our ability to pursue other transactions  including certain kinds of strategic transactions and reorganizations 
also  the tax laws applicable to reits require that we hold our properties for investment  rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business  which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest 
therefore  we may be unable to adjust our portfolio mix promptly in response to market conditions  which may adversely affect our financial position 
in addition  we will be subject to income taxes on gains from the sale of any properties owned by any taxable reit subsidiary 
potential losses may not be covered by insurance 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable losses such as loss from riots  war or acts of god  and  in some cases  flooding 
some of our policies  such as those covering losses due to terrorism and floods  are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover all losses 
if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors also might make it impractical or undesirable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
insurance coverage on our properties may be expensive or difficult to obtain  exposing us to potential risk of loss 
in the future  we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices 
in addition  insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses  such as losses due to terrorist acts  environmental liabilities  or other catastrophic events including hurricanes and floods  or  if offered  the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified 
we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the pro perty  but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 
if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could seriously disrupt our operations  delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property 
events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 
rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions  particularly if such expenses are not offset by corresponding revenues 
our existing properties and any properties we develop or acquire in the future are and will be subject to operating risks common to real estate in general  any or all of which may negatively affect us 
the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties 
as a result  if any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses  we could be required to expend funds for that property s operating expenses 
as of december   our retail operating portfolio was approximately leased compared to approximately as of december  our properties continue to be subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates  utility co sts  operating expenses  insurance costs  repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses  regardless of such properties occupancy rates 
therefore  rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions  particularly if such expenses are not offset by corresponding revenues 
we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination 
the cost of investigation  remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial  and the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
in connection with the ownership  operation and management of real properties  we are potentially liable for removal or remedi ation costs  as well as certain other related costs  including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property 
we may also be liable to third parties for damage and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate 
some of the properties in our portfolio contain  may have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks for petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations may have released  or have the potential to release  such substances into the environment 
in addition  some of our properties have tenants that may use hazardous or toxic substances in the routine course of their businesses 
in general  these tenants have covenanted in their leases with us to use these substances  if any  in compliance with all environmental laws and have agreed to indemnify us for any damages that we may suffer as a result of their use of such substances 
however  these lease provisions may not fully protect us in the event that a tenant becomes insolvent 
finally  one of our properties has contained asbestos containing building materials  or acbm  and another property may have contained such materials based on the date of its construction 
environmental laws require that acbm be properly managed and maintained  and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
the laws also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
our properties must also comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 
we test our properties for compliance with applicable environmental laws on a limited basis 
we cannot give assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our properties reveal all potential environmental liabilities  any previous owner  occupant or tenant of one of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by other unrelated third parties  or future uses or conditions including  without limitation  changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities 
inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
most of our leases contain provisions requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance 
however  increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses  as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents 
also  inflation may adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases or limits on such tenant s obligation to pay its share of operating expenses  which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending  which could impact our tenants sales and  in turn  our average rents  and in some cases  our percentage rents  where applicable 
our share price could be volatile and could decline  resulting in a substantial or complete loss on our shareholders investment 
the stock markets including the new york stock exchange  or the nyse  on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile  and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly operating results  changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  publication by securities analysts of research reports about us or our industry  additions and departures of key personnel  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestments  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours  the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies  an increase in market interest rates  which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds  changes in accounting principles  terrorist acts  and general market conditions  including factors unrelated to our performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
a substantial number of common shares eligible for future sale could cause our common share price to decline significantly 
if our shareholders sell  or the market perceives that our shareholders intend to sell  substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market  the market price of our common shares could decline significantly 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had outstanding  common shares 
of these shares  approximately  are freely tradable  and the remainder of which are mostly held by our affiliates  as that term is defined by rule under the securities act 
in addition   units of our operating partnership are owned by certain of our executive officers and other individuals  and are redeemable by the holder for cash or  at our election  comm on shares 
pursuant to registration rights of certain of our executive officers and other individuals  we filed a registration statement with the sec in august to register  common shares issued or issuable upon redemption of units in our operating partnership in our formation transactions 
as units are redeemed for common shares  the market price of our common shares could drop significantly if the holders of such shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 
risks related to our organization and structure our organizational documents contain provisions that generally would prohibit any person other than members of the kite family who  as a group  are currently allowed to own up to of our outstanding common shares from beneficially owning more than of our outstanding common shares or up to in the case of certain designated investment entities  as defined in our declaration of trust  which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise benefit our shareholders 
our organizational documents contain provisions that may have an anti takeover effect and inhibit a change in our management 
there are ownership limits and restrictions on transferability in our declaration of trust 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year 
to make sure that we will not fail to satisfy this requirement and for anti takeover reasons  our declaration of trust generally prohibits any shareholder other than an excepted holder or certain designated investment entities  as defined in our declaration of trust from owning actually  constructively or by attribution  more than of the value or number of our outstanding common shares 
our declaration of trust provides an excepted holder limit that a llows members of the kite family al kite  john kite and paul kite  their family members and certain entities controlled by one or more of the kites  as a group  to own more than of our outstanding common shares  so long as  under the applicable tax attribution rules  no one excepted holder treated as an individual would hold more than of our common shares  no two excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  no three excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  no four excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  and no five excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares 
currently  one of the excepted holders would be attributed all of the common shares owned by each other excepted holder and  accordingly  the excepted holders as a group would not be allowed to own in excess of of our common shares 
if at a later time  there were not one excepted holder that would be attributed all of the shares owned by the excepted holders as a group  the excepted holder limit would not permit each excepted holder to own of our common shares 
rather  the excepted holder limit would prevent two or more excepted holders who are treated as individuals under the applicable tax attribution rules from owning a higher percentage of our common shares than the maximum amount of common shares that cou ld be owned by any one excepted holder  plus the maximum amount of common shares that could be owned by any one or more other individual common shareholders who are not excepted holders 
certain entities that are defined as designated investment entities in our declaration of trust  which generally includes pension funds  mutual funds  and certain investment management companies  are permitted to own up to of our outstanding common shares  so long as each beneficial owner of the shares owned by such designated investment entity would satisfy the ownership limit if those beneficial owners owned directly their proportionate share of the common shares owned by the designated investment entity 
our board of trustees may waive the ownership limit or the designated investment entity limit for a shareholder that is not an individual if such shareholder provides information and makes representations to the board that are satisfactory to the board  in its reasonable discretion  to establi sh that such person s ownership in excess of the limit or the limit  as applicable  would not jeopardize our qualification as a reit 
in addition  our declaration of trust contains certain other ownership restrictions intended to prevent us from earning income from related parties if such income would cause us to fail to comply with the reit gross income requirements 
the various ownership restrictions may discourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in management or control that might involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders  or compel a shareholder who has acquired our shares in excess of these ownership limitations to dispose of the additional shares and  as a result  to forfeit the benefits of owning the additional shares 
any acquisition of our common shares in violation of these ownership restrictions will be void ab initio and will result in automatic transfers of our common shares to a charitable trust  which will be responsible for selling the common shares to permitted transferees and distributing at least a portion of the proceeds to the prohibited transferees 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue up to  preferred shares  having those preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to distributions  qualifications  or terms or conditions of redemption as determined by our board 
thus  our board could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of our shares 
in addition  a ny preferred shares that we issue likely would rank senior to our common shares with respect to payment of distributions  in which case we could not pay any distributions on our common shares until full distributions were paid with respect to such preferred shares 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other possible anti takeover provisions 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company or the removal of existing management and  as a result  could prevent our shareholders from being paid a premium for their common shares over the then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and our board of trustees power to reclassify shares and issue additional common shares or preferred shares and the absence of cumulative voting rights 
certain provisions of maryland law could inhibit changes in control 
certain provisions of maryland law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares  including business combination moratorium fair price provisions that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested shareholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder  and thereafter imposes stringent fair price and super majority shareholder voting requirements on these combinations  and control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company defined as shares which  when aggregated with other shares controlled by the shareholder  entitle the shareholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing trustees acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares from a party other than the issuer have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding all interested shares  and are subject to redemption in certain circumstances 
we have opted out of these provisions of maryland law 
however  our board of trustees may opt to make these provisions applicable to us at any time 
certain officers and trustees may have interests that conflict with the interests of shareholders 
certain of our officers and members of our board of trustees own limited partner units in our operating partnership 
these individuals may have personal interests that conflict with the interests of our shareholders with respect to business decisions affecting us and our operating partnership  such as interests in the timing and pricing of property sales or refinancings in order to obtain favorable tax treatment 
as a result  the effect of certain transactions on these unit holders may influence our decisions affecting these properties 
departure or loss of our key officers could have an adverse effect on us 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of our existing executive officers 
our executive officers experience in real estate acquisition  development and finance are critical elements of our future success 
we have employment agreements with each of our executive officers that provided for a term that ended in december  with automatic one year renewals unless either we or the officer elects not to renew the agreement 
these agreements were automatically renewed for our three executive officers through december  if one or more of our key executives were to die  become disabled or otherwise leave the company s employ  we may not be able to replace this person with an executive officer of equal skill  ability  and industry expertise 
until suitable replacements could be identified and hired  if at all  our operations and financial condition could be impaired 
we depend on external capital to fund our capital needs 
to qualify as a reit  we will be required to distribute to our shareholders each year at least of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains 
in order to eliminate federal income tax  we will be required to distribute annually of our net taxable income  including capital gains 
partly because of these distribution requirements  we will not be able to fund all future capital needs  including capital for property development and acquisitions  with income from operations 
we therefore will have to rely on third party sources of capital  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends on a number of things  including the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and our ability to qualify as a reit f or federal income tax purposes 
our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited 
maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith  in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances 
our declaration of trust and bylaws require us to indemnify our trustees and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the extent permitted by maryland law 
as a result  we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our trustees and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 
accordingly  in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our trustees or officers impede the performance of our company  our shareholders ability to recover damages from such trustee or officer will be limited our shareholders have limited ability to prevent us from making any changes to our policies that they believe could harm our business  prospects  operating results or share price 
our board of trustees has adopted policies with respect to certain activities 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of our board of trustees without a vote of our shareholders 
this means that our shareholders will have limited control over changes in our policies 
such changes in our policies intended to improve  expand or diversify our business may not have the anticipated effects and consequently may adversely affect our business and prospects  results of operations and share price 
tax risks failure of our company to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to us and our shareholders 
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december  we intend to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit  but we cannot assure shareholders that we will qualify as a reit 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we qualify as a reit  and the statements in this annual report on form k are not binding on the irs or any court 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our shareholders 
many of the reit requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within ou r control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from specific passive sources  such as rent  that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
in addition  to qualify as a reit  we cannot own specified amounts of debt and equity securities of some issuers 
we also are required to distribute to our shareholders with respect to each year at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and joint ventures further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status and  given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits and the ongoing importance of factual determinations  we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to qualify as a reit 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new ruli ngs  that make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to remain qualified as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the internal revenue code  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
as a taxable corporation  we would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income or pass through long term capital gains to individual shareholders at favorable rates 
we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 
we would not be able to elect to be taxed as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify unless the irs were to grant us relief under certain statutory provisions 
if we failed to qualify as a reit  we would have to pay significant income taxes  whic h would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  such failure would cause an event of default under our unsecured revolving credit facility and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and to service our debt 
this likely would have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and the value of our securities 
in addition  we would no longer be required to pay any distributions to shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the statutory savings provisions in order to maintain our reit status  we would nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of  or more for each such failure 
we will pay some taxes even if we qualify as a reit 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income including capital gains 
additionally  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
moreover  if we have net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of bu siness 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
while we will undertake sales of assets if those assets become inconsistent with our long term strategic or return objectives  we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions  but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 
the need to avoid prohibited transactions could cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that our predecessors otherwise would have sold or that it might otherwise be in our best interest to sell 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable reit subsidiaries  or through entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities separate from our taxable reit subsidiaries  will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax 
we have elected to treat kite realty holdings  llc as a taxable reit subsidiary  and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that i t receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrangements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income because not all states and localities treat reits the same way they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  we will have less cash available for distributions to our shareholders 
reit distribution requirements may increase our indebtedness 
we may be required from time to time  under certain circumstances  to accrue income for tax purposes that has not yet been received 
in such event  or upon our repayment of principal on debt  we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit 
accordingly  we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 
we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own common shares  in which case shareholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive 
we may in the future distribute taxable dividends that are payable partly in cash and partly in our common shares 
under existing irs guidance with respect to taxable years ending on or before december   up to of such a dividend could be payable in our common shares 
taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes  regardless of whether such shareholder receives cash  reit shares or a combination of cash and reit shares 
as a result  a shareholder may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividend 
if a shareholder sells the reit shares it receives in order to pay this tax  the sales proceeds may be le ss than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend  if the market value of our shares decreases following the distribution 
furthermore  with respect to certain non us stockholders  we may be required to withhold us federal income tax with respect to dividends paid in our common shares 
in addition  if a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends  it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common shares 
dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 
the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to income from qualified dividends payable to us shareholders that are individuals  trusts and estates has been reduced by legislation to through 
unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit  the company s distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits  the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals  trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the shares of re its  including our common shares

distributions by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes will be taxable to shareholders as either ordinary dividend income or capital gain income if so declared by us 
distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non taxable return of capital 
these distributions  to the extent that they do not exceed the shareholder s adjusted tax basis in its common shares  have the effect of deferring taxation until the sale of a shareholder s common shares 
to the extent that distributions are both in excess of earnings and profits and in excess of the shareholder s adjusted tax basis in its common shares  the distribution will be treated as gain from the sale of common shares 
in order to ma intain our qualification as a reit  we must make annual distributions to shareholders of at least of our reit taxable income and we must make distributions to shareholders equal to of our net taxable income to eliminate federal income tax liability 
under certain circumstances  we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements

we had determined during the third quarter of that there was no value to the improvements and intangibles related to galleria plaza and recognized a non cash impairment charge of million to write off the net book value of the property 
since we ceased operating this property during the fourth quarter of  it was appropriate to reclassify the non cash impairment loss and the operating results related to this property to discontinued operations for each of the fiscal years presented above 
in december  we sold our silver glen crossing operating property for net proceeds of approximately million and recognized a loss on the sale of million 
the loss on sale and operating results for this property have been reflected as discontinued operations for each of the fiscal years presented above 
amounts related to this particular property had not previously been reclassified for fiscal years or prior as they were not considered material to the financial statements

in this discussion  unless the context suggests otherwise  references to the company  we  us and our mean kite realty group trust and its subsidiaries 
overview in the following overview  we discuss  among other things  the status of our business and properties  the effect that current united states economic conditions is having on our retail tenants and us  and the current state of the financial markets as pertaining to our debt maturities and our ability to secure financing 
our business and properties kite realty group trust  through its majority owned subsidiary  kite realty group  lp  is engaged in the ownership  operation  management  leasing  acquisition  construction  expansion and development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and certain commercial real estate properties in selected markets in the united states 
we derive revenues primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties 
we also derive revenues from providing management  leasing  real estate development  construction and real estate advisory services through our taxable reit subsidiary 
our operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments  our ability to provide such services to third parties  conditions in the united states retail sector and overall real estate market conditions 
as of december   we owned interests in a portfolio of operating retail properties totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area including non owned anchor space and also owned interests in three operating commercial properties totaling approximately million square feet of net rentable area and an associated parking garage 
also  as of december   we had an interest in seven properties in our development and redevelopment pipelines 
upon completion  we anticipate our development and redevelopment properties will have approximately million square of total gross leasable area 
finally  as of december   we also owned interests in other land parcels comprising approximately acres that we expect to be used for future expansion of existing properties  development of new retail or commercial properties or sold to third parties 
these land parcels are classified as land held for development in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
current economic conditions and impact on our retail tenants the difficult economic conditions for the united states economy  businesses  consumers  housing and credit markets continued throughout these difficult conditions had a negative impact on consumer spending during  and we expect these conditions to continue into  and possibly longer 
factors contributing to consumers spending less at stores owned and or operated by our retail tenants include  among others shortage or unavailability of financing lending institutions continue to maintain very tight credit standards  making it difficult for individuals and companies including our tenants to obtain financing 
the shortage of financing has caused  among other things  consumers to have less disposable income available for retail spending 
the shortage of financing has also made it difficult for some of our tenants to obtain capital to operate their businesses 
decreased home values and increased home foreclosures us home values have decreased sharply over the last few years  and difficult economic conditions have also contributed to a record number of home foreclosures 
the us continues to experience historically high levels of delinquencies and foreclosures  particularly among sub prime mortgage borrowers 
rising unemployment rates the us unemployment rate continues to be much higher than historical norms 
unemployment reached in november  the highest level in years 
high unemployment rates could cause further decreases in consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the businesses of our retail tenants 
deceasing consumer confidence consumer confidence continues to be at low levels  leading to consumers spending less money on discretionary purchases 
the significant increases in both personal and business bankruptcies during reflect an economy that continues to be challenged  with financially over extended consumers less likely to purchase goods and or services from our retail tenants 
during  decreasing consumer spending had a negative impact on the businesses of our retail tenants  as reflected in weak retail sales for much of the year as discussed below  these conditions in turn had a negative impact on our business 
while we did experience an increase in leasing activity in the fourth quarter of  to the extent these conditions persist or deteriorate further  our tenants may be required to curtail or cease their operations  which could materially and negatively affect our business in general and our cash flow in particular 
impact of economy on reits  including us as an owner and developer of community and neighborhood shopping centers  our operating and financial performance is directly affected by economic conditions in the retail sector of those markets in which our operating centers and development properties are located 
this is particularly true in the states of indiana  florida and texas  where the majority of our properties are located  and in north carolina  where a significant portion of our development projects and land parcels held for development are located 
as discussed above  due to the challenges facing us consumers  the operations of many of our retail tenants are being negatively affected 
in turn  this has a negative impact on our business  including in the following ways difficulty in collecting rent  rent adjustments 
when consumers spend less  our tenants typically experience decreased revenues and cash flows 
this makes it more difficult for some of our tenants to pay their rent obligations  which is the primary source of our revenues 
our tenants decreased cash flows may be even more pronounced if  given the tight credit markets  they are unable to obtain financing to operate their businesses 
the number of tenants requesting decreases or deferrals in their rent obligations continued to be above historical norms in  although such requests leveled off in the second half of the year 
if granted  such decreases or deferrals negatively affect our cash flows 
termination of leases 
if our tenants continue to struggle to meet their rental obligations  they may be forced to terminate their leases with us 
during  tenants at some of our properties terminated their leases with us 
in some cases we were able to negotiate lease termination fees from these tenants but in other cases our negotiations were unsuccessful 
tenant bankruptcies 
the number of bankruptcies by us businesses continued to be at elevated levels during this trend has continued into and may continue into the foreseeable future 
likewise  bankruptcies of our retail tenants were also higher than historical norms during decrease in demand for retail space 
reflecting the extremely difficult current market conditions  demand for retail space at our shopping centers continued to be low while availability has increased due to tenant terminations and bankruptcies 
while our leasing activity did see an increase in the fourth quarter of  the overall tenancy at our shopping centers declined over the last months and may continue to decline in the future until financial markets  consumer confidence  and the economy stabilize 
in addition  these conditions have made it significantly more difficult for us to lease space in our development projects  which may adversely affect the expected returns from these projects or delay their completion 
the factors discussed above  among others  had a negative impact on our business during we expect that these conditions may continue well into the foreseeable future 
financing strategy  and maturities our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms and to refinance borrowings as they mature has also been affected by the condition of the economy in general and by the current instability of the financial markets in particular 
as of february   we had refinanced or extended the maturity dates for all of our debt maturities  as discussed below 
currently  approximately million of our consolidated indebtedness is scheduled to mature in in particular  i our unsecured term loan  which had a balance of million as of december   will mature on july  and ii our unsecured revolving credit facility  which had a balance of approximately million as of december   will mature on february  with a one year extension option to february  available i f we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the related agreement 
we are conducting negotiations with our existing and potential replacement lenders to refinance or obtain extensions on our term loan and unsecured revolving credit facility 
we believe we have good relationships with a number of banks and other financial institutions that will allow us to continue our strategy of refinancing our borrowings with the existing lenders or replacement lenders 
however  in this current challenging environment  it is imperative that we identify alternative sources of financing and other capital in the event we are not able to refinance these loans on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if we are not able to refinance or extend these loans  particularly our unsecured term loan  our financial condition and liquidity could be adversely impacted 
it is also important for us to obtain additional financing in order to complete our development and redevelopment projec ts 
to strengthen our balance sheet  we continued to consider appropriate financing transactions in for example  in may  we completed an equity offering of  common shares at an offering price of per share for aggregate gross and net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and the remainder was retained as cash  which we used to address future debt maturities and capital needs 
in addition  in december we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may sell  from time to time  up to an aggregate amount of million of our common shares 
to date  we have not utilized this program 
as of decem ber   we had combined approximately million of available liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents million and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility million 
in addition to raising new capital  we have also been successful in extending the maturity dates or refinancing loans originally maturing in for example  during the fourth quarter of  we extended the maturity date or refinanced the debt at three of our properties ridge plaza  to january  tarpon springs plaza  to january  and estero town commons  to january 
further  in the first quarter of  we negotiated the extension of the maturity dates on the debt at three other properties south elgin commons  to september  cobblestone plaza  to february  and shops at rivers edge  to february 
as a result of these actions and others  we refinanced or extended the maturity dates to on approximately million of indebtedness originally due in a schedule of our maturities excluding regular principal payments after consideration of these early refinancing actions follows amounts due balances at maturity as of after december  annual subsequent maturity date maturities activity extensions thereafter unamortized premiums total we will continue to assess and engage in negotiations with existing and alternative lenders for our near term maturing indebtedness  with a view toward extending  refinancing or repaying debt to strengthen our balance sheet 
obtaining new financing is also important to our business due to the capital needs of our existing development and redevelopment projects 
as of december   our unfunded share of the total estimated cost of the properties in our current development and redevelopment pipelines was approximately million 
while we believe we will have access to sufficient funding to be able to fund our investments in these projects through a combination of new and existing construction loans and draws on our unsecured revolving credit facility which  as noted above  has million of availability as of december   a prolonged credit crisis will make it more costly and difficult to raise additional capital  if necessary 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the compilation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
purchase accounting in accordance with topic business combinations in the asc  we measure identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interests in an acquiree at fair value on the acquisition date  with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired 
in making estimates of fair values for the purpose of allocating purchase price  a number of sources are utilized  including information obtained as a result of pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities 
a portion of the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets and intangibles  including the fair value of the building on an as if vacant basis and to land determined either by real estate tax assessments  independent appraisals or other relevant data  above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over the remaining non cancelable term of the leases 
the capitalized above market and below market lease values are amortized as a reduction of or addition to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
should a tenant vacate  terminate its lease  or otherwise notify us of its intent to do so  the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged or credited to income  and the value of leases acquired 
we utilize independent sources for estimates to determine the respective in place lease values 
our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors we consider in their analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases including tenant improvements  leasing commissions and foregone costs and rent received during the estimated lease up period as if the space was vacant 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
we also consider whether a portion of the purchase price should be allocated to in place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value 
characteristics we consider in allocating these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
to date  a tenant relationship has not been developed that is considered to have a current intangible value 
due to the january  adoption of new accounting guidance regarding business combinations  the costs of an acquisition are expensed in the period incurred 
capitalization of certain pre development and development costs we incur costs prior to land acquisition and for certain land held for development  including acquisition contract deposits as well as legal  engineering and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center or other project 
these pre development costs are capitalized and included in construction in progress in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that the completion of a development project is no longer probable  all previously incurred pre development costs are immediately expensed 
we also capitalize costs such as construction  interest  real estate taxes  and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved with the development of our properties 
as a portion of the development property becomes operational  we expense appropriate costs on a pro rata basis 
impairment of investment properties management reviews investment properties  land parcels and intangible assets within the real estate operation and development segment for impairment on at least a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable 
the review for possible impairment requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates and requires significant judgment 
impairment losses for investment properties are measured when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected holding period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are recorded as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset 
our impairment revi ew for land and development properties assumes we have the intent and the ability to complete the developments or projected uses for the land parcels 
if we determine those plans will not be completed  an impairment loss may be appropriate 
in the third quarter of  as part of our regular quarterly review  we determined that it was appropriate to write off the net book value on the galleria plaza operating property in dallas  texas and recognize a non cash impairment charge of million 
our estimated future cash flows  which considered recent negative property specific events  were anticipated to be insufficient to recover the carrying value due to significant ground lease obligations and expected future required capital expenditures 
we conveyed the title to the center to the ground lessor in the fourth quarter of management does not believe any other investment properties or development assets are impaired as of december  operating properties held for sale include only those properties available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year 
operating properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held for sale period 
our properties have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities 
the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished 
the operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations  and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition 
when material  prior periods are reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
revenue recognition as lessor  we retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases 
base minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on a tenant s sales volume contingent percentage rent 
percentage rent is recognized when tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements 
percentage rent is included in other property related revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expense is incurred 
gains and losses from sales are not recognized unless a sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
project costs include all direct labor  subcontract  and material costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance incurred to date 
project costs do not include uninstalled materials 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income  which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
development fees and fees from advisory services are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services are rendered 
performance based incentive fees are recorded when the fees are earned 
fair value measurements fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs for identical instruments that are classified within level and observable inputs for similar instruments that are classified within level and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 
as further discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the only assets or liabilities that we record at fair value on a recurring basis are interest rate hedge agreements 
the valuation is determined using widely accepted techniques including discounted cash flow analysis  which considers the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable market based inputs such as interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
we also incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties 
however  as of december   we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives 
as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
income taxes and reit compliance we are considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes and qualify as a reit 
as such  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute our reit taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain other requirements on a recurring basis 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we may also be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income even if we do qualify as a reit 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit ta xable income including capital gains 
results of operations at december   we owned interests in operating properties consisting of retail properties  three operating commercial office industrial properties and an associated parking garage and seven entities that held development or redevelopment properties in which we have an interest 
these redevelopment properties include bolton plaza  coral springs plaza  courthouse shadows  shops at rivers edge and four corner square  all of which are undergoing major redevelopment

this build to suit commercial asset that we sold was adjacent to spring mill medical i and was owned in our taxable reit subsidiary through a owned joint venture with a third party 
our proceeds from this sale were approximately million  and our associated construction costs were approximately million  including a million payment to our joint venture partner to acquire their partnership interest prior to the sale to a third party 
our share of net proceeds of approximately million from this s ale was primarily used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
income from unconsolidated entities increased approximately million  or 
this increase is due to a gain from the sale of a land parcel  our share of which was million 
gain on sale of unconsolidated property was million in and resulted from the sale of our interest in spring mill medical  phase i  one of our unconsolidated commercial operating properties

other income  net  decreased approximately million  or  primarily as a result of a million payment received from a lender in consideration for our agreement to terminate a loan commitment in discontinued operations decreased approximately million to million  largely due to the operations of our galleria plaza property which had net income of million in and a net loss of million is due to the loss of its anchor tenant 
the remaining decrease reflects the write off to income of a market rent adjustment of million upon the loss of the anchor tenant at our silver glen operating property in loss gain on sale of operating properties reflects the sale of our silver glen crossings property at a loss of million and the sale of our th meridian property for a gain of million 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased million from million in to million in this decrease reflects the decrease on our consolidated net income from million in to million in the weighted average limited partners interest in our operating partnership remained relatively unchanged between years 
liquidity and capital resources current state of capital markets and our financing strategy our primary finance and capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost effective manner 
we consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings  including the purchase price of properties to be developed or acquired with debt financing  the estimated market value of our properties and our company as a whole upon consummation of the refinancing  and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service 
as discussed in more detail above in overview  the challenging market conditions that currently exist have created a need for most reits  including us  to place a significant amount of emphasis on financing and capital strategies 
in october and may  we received aggregate net proceeds of million from offerings of our common shares 
we used a portion of the proceeds from these offerings to reduce the amounts of indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility and other borrowings 
as a result  approximately million was outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility as of december  as compared to million as of the end of the prior year 
in addition to raising new capital  we have also been successful in refinancing or extending the maturities of our debt that was originally scheduled to mature in and as of february   all of our maturities for were successfully extended or refinanced into future years 
our unsecured revolving credit facility and million unsecured term loan are both scheduled to mature in  although the unsecured revolving credit facility has a one year extension to february  available if we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the related agreement 
the aggregate amount of outstanding indebtedness under both of these agreements is million as of december  we discuss both of these borrowings in more detail below 
we are conduct ing negotiations with our existing and potential replacement lenders to refinance or obtain extensions on both of these borrowings 
we were also able to effectively recycle capital by selling outlot and unoccupied land parcels 
during  we generated gross proceeds from such sales of million  a portion of which was used to pay down outstanding indebtedness 
in the future  we may raise additional capital by pursuing joint venture capital partners and or disposing of additional properties  land parcels or other assets that are no longer core components of our growth strategy 
we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately million 
we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk with regards to our cash and cash equivalents 
we place our cash and short term cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions 
as of december   the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held in deposit accounts that are insured by the federal government s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
from time to time  such investments may temporarily be held in accounts that are not insured under this program and which are in excess of fdic and sipc insurance limits  however we attempt to limit our exposure at any one time 
we also maintain certain compensating balances in several financial institutions in support of borrowings from those institutions 
such compensating balances were not material to the consolidated balance sheets 
our principal capital resources our unsecured revolving credit facility our operating partnership has entered into an amended and restated four year million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders and key bank national association  as agent the unsecured facility 
we and several of the operating partnership s subsidiaries are guarantors of the operating partnership s obligations under the unsecured facility 
the unsecured facility has a maturity date of february   with a one year extension option to february available if we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the related agreement 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the unsecured facility as of december  borrowings under the unsecured facility bear interest at a variable interest rate of libor to basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
the unsecured facility has a to commitment fee applicable to the average daily unused amount 
subject to certain conditions  including the prior consent of the lenders  we have the option to increase our borrowings under the unsecured facility to a maximum of million if there are sufficient unencumbered assets to support the additional borrowings 
the unsecured facility also includes a short term borrowing line of million with a variable interest rate 
borrowings under the short term line m ay not be outstanding for more than five days 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured facility was approximately million  bearing interest at a rate of libor basis points 
factoring in our hedge agreements  at december   our weighted average interest rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility was approximately 
as of december   the amount available to us for future draws was approximately million 
the amount that we may borrow under the unsecured facility is based on the value of assets in the unencumbered property pool 
we currently have unencumbered properties and other assets  of which are wholly owned and used to calculate the amount available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility and three of which are owned through joint ventures 
the major unencumbered assets include boulevard crossing  broadstone station  coral springs plaza  courthouse shadows  four corner square  hamilton crossing  king s lake square  market street village  naperville marketplace  pen products  publix at acworth  red bank commons  shops at eagle creek  traders point ii  union station parking garage  wal mart plaza  and waterford lakes 
our ability to borrow under the unsecured facility is subject to ongoing compliance with various restrictive covenants  including with respect to liens  indebtedness  investments  dividends  mergers and asset sales 
in addition  the unsecured facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio of or up to in certain circumstances  adjusted ebitda as defined in the unsecured facility to fixed charges coverage ratio of at least to  minimum tangible net worth defined as total asset value less total indebtedness of million plus of the net proceeds of any future equity issuances  ratio of net operating income of unencumbered property to debt service under the unsecured facility of at least to  minimum unencumbered property pool occupancy rate of  ratio of variable rate indebtedness to total asset value of no more than to  and ratio of recourse indebtedness to total asset value of no more than to we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the unsecured facility as of december  under the terms of the unsecured facility  we are permitted to make distributions to our shareholders of up to of our funds from operations provided that no event of default exists 
if an event of default exists  we may only make distributions sufficient to maintain our reit status 
however  we may not make any distributions if an event of default resulting from nonpayment or bankruptcy exists  or if our obligations under the credit facility are accelerated 
capital markets we have filed a registration statement  and subsequent prospectus supplements related thereto  with the securities and exchange commission allowing us to offer  from time to time  common shares or preferred shares for an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million 
in may  we issued  common shares for offering proceeds  net of offering costs  of approximately million 
in addition  in december  we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may sell  from time to time  up to an aggregate amount of million of our common shares 
we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
short and long term liquidity needs overview we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
while we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically invest primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a relatively stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  the current general economic downturn is adversely affecting the ability of some of our tenants to meet their lease obligations  as discussed in more detail above in overview on page these conditions  in turn  are having a negative impact on our business 
if the d ownturn in the financial markets and economy is prolonged  our cash flow from operations could be significantly affected 
short term liquidity needs the nature of our business  coupled with the requirements to qualify for reit status and avoid paying tax on our income  necessitate that we distribute of our taxable income on an annual basis  which will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term 
our short term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt  expected dividend payments including distributions to persons who hold units in our operating partnership and recurring capital expenditures 
in may  our board of trustees the board declared a quarterly cash distribution of per common share for the quarter ended june  this per share distribution was continued for the quarters ended september  and december  these distributions were lower than in prior periods which allowed us to conserve cash 
each quarter we discuss with our board our liquidity requirements along with other relevant factors before the board decides whether and in what amount to declare a distribution 
when we lease space to new tenants  or renew leases for existing tenants  we also incur expenditures for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
this amount  as well as the amount of recurring capital expenditures that we incur  will vary from year to year 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on operating properties and also incurred approximately million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
we currently anticipate incurring approximately million in capital expenditures at our operating properties and approximately million of additional major tenant improvements and renovation costs within the next twelve months at several properties in our redevelopment pipeline 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through borrowings under the unsecured facility  new construction loans  cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  accessing the public equity and debt markets to the extent that we are able to do so 
debt maturities as of december   approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness was scheduled to mature in  excluding scheduled monthly principal payments 
subsequent to year end  we refinanced or extended the maturity dates of of this indebtedness as follows the maturity date of the million variable rate loan on the shops at rivers edge property was extended to february at an interest rate of libor basis points 
we funded a million paydown on this loan with cash  the maturity date of the million variable rate construction loan on the cobblestone plaza property was extended to february at an interest rate of libor basis points 
we funded a million paydown on this loan with cash and draws from our unsecured facility  and the maturity date of the million south elgin commons construction loan was extended to september at an interest rate of libor basis points 
we funded a million paydown on this loan with cash and draws from our unsecured facility 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the development of new properties  redevelopment of existing properties  non recurring capital expenditures  acquisitions of properties  and payment of indebtedness at maturity 
unsecured facility and term loan 
as discussed above  our unsecured term loan  which had a balance of million as of december   will mature on july  and our unsecured facility  which had a balance of approximately million as of december   will mature on february  with a one year extension option to february  available if we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the related agreement 
we are conducting negotiations with our existing and potential replacement lenders to refinance or obtain extensions on our term loan and credit facility 
redevelopment properties 
as of december   five of our properties coral springs plaza  bolton plaza  shops at rivers edge  courthouse shadows and four corner square were undergoing major redevelopment activities 
we currently anticipate our investment in these redevelopment projects will be a total of approximately million 
we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund our investment in these projects through borrowings on our unsecured credit facility 
in certain circumstances  we may seek to place specific construction financing on these redevelopment projects 
development properties 
as of december   we had two projects in our development pipeline 
the total estimated cost  including our share and our joint venture partners share  for these projects is approximately million  of which approximately million had been incurred as of december  our share of the total estimated cost of these projects is approximately million  of which we have incurred approximately million as of december  we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through existing construction loans  including the construction loan on the eddy street commons development project 
this loan has a total commitment of approximatel y million  of which million was outstanding at december  in addition  if necessary  we may make draws on our unsecured facility 
the eddy street commons project is expected to include retail  office  hotels  a parking garage  apartments and residential units and is discussed in more detail below under contractual obligations obligations in connection with our development  redevelopment and shadow pipeline 
shadow development pipeline 
in addition to our current development pipeline  we have a shadow development pipeline which includes land parcels that are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financing 
as of december   this shadow pipeline consisted of six projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet of total leasable area 
we currently anticipate the total estimated cost of these projects will be approximately million  of which our share is currently expected to be approximately million 
although we intend to develop these properties  which is a key assumption in our impairment review  we are generally not contractual ly obligated to complete any developments in our shadow pipeline  as these projects consist of land parcels on which we have not yet commenced construction 
with respect to each asset in the shadow pipeline  our policy is to not commence vertical construction until pre established leasing thresholds are achieved and the requisite third party financing is in place 
once these projects are transferred to the current development pipeline  we intend to fund our investment in these developments primarily through new construction loans and joint ventures  as well as borrowings on our unsecured facility  if necessary 
selective acquisitions  developments and joint ventures 
we may selectively pursue the acquisition and development of other properties  which would require additional capital 
it is unlikely we would have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long term capital requirements 
we would have to satisfy these needs through participation in joint venture arrangements  additional borrowings  sales of common or preferred shares and or cash generated through property dispositions 
we cannot be certain that we would have access to these sources of capital on satisfactory terms  if at all  to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors  including general capital market conditions  which is discussed in more detail above in overview on page we have entered into an agreement the venture with prudential real estate investors prei to pursue joint venture opportunities for the development and selected acquisition of community shopping centers in the united states 
the agreement allows for the venture to develop or acquire up to billion of well positioned community shopping centers in strategic markets in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  we have agreed to present to prei opportunities to develop or acquire community shopping centers  each with estimated project costs in excess of million 
we have the option to present to prei additional opportunities with estimated project costs under million 
the agreement allows for equity capital contributions of up to million to be made to the venture for qualifying projects 
we expect contributions would be made on a project by project basis with prei contributing and us contributing of the equity required 
our first project with prei is parkside town commons  which is currently in our shadow development pipeline 
as of december   we owned a interest in this joint venture which  under the terms of this joint venture  will be reduced to upon construction financing 
cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the decrease was primarily due to higher cash outflows for accounts payable and accrued expenses in  the majority of which reflects declining third party construction activity 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of a decline of million in acquisitions of interests in properties and capital expenditures 
as part of our cash conservation strategy  we significantly reduced our acquisition  development and construction activities 
offsetting this decrease were million of net proceeds from the sale of our silver glen crossings operating property  million of contributions to our parkside town commons development property and the centre operating property and a million change in construction payables 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  a decrease of million from in  we had lower borrowings of million due to a decline in our construction activity 
among the more significant changes in financing activities between years are the following in  we had borrowings totaling million in connection with the acquisition of our shops at rivers edge operating property and new hill place development property  offset by proceeds totaling million from the sales of our silver glen crossings and spring mill operating properties and outlot and land parcels 
net loan paydowns were million higher in compared to as a result of the use of common share offering proceeds to reduce our levels of indebtedness 
these net changes were partially offset by million higher proceeds from our common share offering compared to our offerings and million lower cash distribution payments to common shareholders and operating partnership unitholders as a result of a lowering of our per share rate of distribution 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to a change in accounts payable  accrued expenses  deferred revenue and other liabilities of million between years  which was primarily due to construction related expenses as well as the conservation of cash 
this increase was partially offset by a change in deferred costs and other assets of million between years 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of an increase of million in net proceeds from the sale of an operating property  which was the result of the net proceeds from the sale of silver glen crossings compared to the sale of th meridian 
this was partially offset by an increase of million in acquisitions of interests in properties and capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  a decrease of million from the net of loan proceeds  transaction costs and payments decreased million between years primarily due to the million draw from the unsecured facility in compared to the million proceeds received under the unsecured term loan in  both of which were used to repay previously outstanding indebtedness 
this was partially offset by the million of offering proceeds  the majority of which was received in october when we completed an equity offering of  common shares at an offering price of per share 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do  however  have certain obligations to some of the projects in our current development pipeline  including our obligations in connection with our eddy street commons development  as discussed below in contractual obligations  as well as our joint venture with prei with respect to our parkside town commons development  as discussed above 
as of december   we owned a interest in this joint venture which  under the terms of this joint venture  will be reduced to upon construction financi ng 
as of december   our share of unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness was million 
unconsolidated joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by the assets of the joint venture 
as of december   the operating partnership had guaranteed its million share of the unconsolidated joint venture debt related to the parkside town commons development in the event the joint venture partnership defaults under the terms of the underlying arrangement 
mortgages which are guaranteed by the operating partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture and the joint venture could sell the property in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information o n our unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended december   and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties  excluding interest  based on contracts executed as of december construction contracts tenant allowances operating leases consolidated long term debt pro rata share of joint venture debt employment contracts other total thereafter unamortized debt premiums total tenant allowances include commitments made to tenants at our operating  development and redevelopment properties 
in february  we extended the maturity dates of all of our maturities to see table reflecting these refinancing activities on page we have entered into employment agreements with certain members of senior management 
under these agreements  each individual received a stipulated annual base salary through december  each agreement has an automatic one year renewal unless we or the individual elects not to renew the agreement 
the contracts have been extended through december  in  we incurred million of interest expense  net of amounts capitalized of million 
in connection with the construction of the eddy street commons parking garage and certain infrastructure improvements  we are obligated to fund payments under tax increment financing tif bonds issued by the city of south bend  indiana 
the majority of the bonds will be funded by real estate tax payments made by us and subject to reimbursement from the tenants of the property 
if there are delays in the development  we are obligated to pay certain delay fees 
however  we have an agreement with the city of south bend to limit our exposure to a maximum of million as to such fees 
in addition  we will not be in default concerning other obligations under the agreement with the city of south bend so long as we commence and diligently pursue the completion of our obligations under that agreement 
see maturities on page for additional information with respect to our current plan to address our indebtedness maturing in fiscal year and beyond 
in connection with our formation at the time of our ipo  we entered into an agreement that restricts our ability  prior to december   to dispose of six of our properties in taxable transactions and limits the amount of gain we can trigger with respect to certain other properties without incurring reimbursement obligations owed to certain limited partners 
we have agreed that if we dispose of any interest in six specified properties in a taxable transaction before december   then we will indemnify the contributors of those properties for their tax liabilities attributable to their built in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our ipo and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment 
the six properties to which our tax indemnity obligations relate represented approximately of our annualized base rent in the aggregate as of december  these six properties are international speedway square  shops at eagle creek  whitehall pike  ridge plaza shopping center  thirty south  and market street village 
construction contracts construction contracts in the table above represent commitments for contracts executed as of december  related to new developments  redevelopments and third party construction 
obligations in connection with our current development  redevelopment and shadow pipeline we are obligated under various contractual arrangements to complete the projects in our current development pipeline 
we currently anticipate our share of the total cost of the two projects in our current development pipeline will be approximately million including million of costs associated with phase i of our eddy street commons development discussed below  of which approximately million of our share was unfunded as of december  in addition  we have commenced with the construction of a limited service hotel component of this project of which we will own in a joint venture 
we currently estimate that our share of the total cost of this hotel will be approximately million 
we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primari ly through existing construction loans  including the construction loan on eddy street commons that closed in december  with a total loan commitment of approximately million  of which million was outstanding at december  in addition  if necessary  we may make draws on our unsecured facility 
in addition to our current development pipeline  we also have a redevelopment pipeline and a shadow development pipeline  which includes land parcels that are undergoing pre development activity and are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financings 
although we currently intend to develop the shadow pipeline  we are not contractually obligated to complete any projects in our redevelopment or shadow pipelines  as these consist of land parcels on which we have not yet commenced construction 
with respect to each asset in the shadow pipeline  our policy is to not commence vertical construction until appropriate pre leasing thresholds are met and the requisite third party financing is in place 
eddy street commons at the university of notre dame the most significant project in our current development pipeline is eddy street commons at the university of notre dame located adjacent to the university in south bend  indiana  that is expected to include retail  office  hotels  a parking garage  apartments and residential units 
a majority of the office space will be leased to the university of notre dame 
the city of south bend has contributed approximately million to the development  funded by tax increment financing tif bonds issued by the city and a cash commitment from the city  both of which are being used for the construction of a parking garage and infrastructure improvements in this project 
the majority of the bonds will be funded by real estate tax payments made by us and subject to reimbursement from the tenants of the property 
 if there are delays in the development  we are obligated to pay certain delay fees 
however  we have an agreement with the city of south bend to limit our exposure to a maximum of million as to such fees 
in addition  we will not be in default concerning other obligations under the agreement with the city of south bend so long as we commence and diligently pursue the completion of our obligations under that agreement 
this development will be completed in several phases 
the initial phase of the project opened in october and consists of the retail  office and apartment and residential units with an estimated total cost of million net of amounts funded by the tif bonds of which our share is estimated to be million 
this phase is leased as of december  the ground beneath the initial phase of the development is leased from the university of notre dame over a year term at a fixed rate for first two years and based on a percentage of certain revenues thereafter 
the total estimated project costs for all phases of this development are currently estimated to be approximately million  our share of which is currently expected to be approximately million 
our exposure to this amount m ay be limited under certain circumstances 
we own the retail and office components while the apartments are owned by a third party 
the hotel components of the project will be owned through joint ventures while the apartments and residential units are planned to be sold or operated through relationships with developers  owners and operators that specialize in residential real estate 
we do not expect to own either the residential or the apartment complex components of the project  although we have jointly guaranteed the apartment developer s construction loan 
the first phase of the apartments opened during the second half of with the second phase expected to open in the second half of construction on the residential units will commence as demand warrants 
vertical construction commenced on a limited service hotel in september and the opening of this project is expected to occur in the second half of in we received  and we expect to receive in the future  development  construction management  and other fees from various aspects of this project 
we have a contractual obligation in the form of a completion guarantee to the university of notre dame and a similar contractual agreement in favor of the city of south bend to complete all phases of the project  with the exception of certain of the residential units  consistent with commitments we typically make in connection with other bank funded development projects 
to the extent the hotel joint venture partner  the apartment developer owner or the residential developer owner fail to complete those aspects of the project  we will be required to complete the construction  at which time we expect that we would have the right to seek title to the assets and assume any construction borrowings related to the assets 
we will have certain remedies against the developers if they were to fail to complete the construc tion 
if we fail to fulfill our contractual obligations in connection with the project  but are timely commencing and pursuing a cure  we will not be in default to either the university of notre dame or the city of south bend

we entered into a cash flow hedge agreement on this debt instrument to fix the interest rate

subsequent to december   the maturity date on this loan was extended to the year funds from operations funds from operations ffo  is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which we refer to as the white paper 
the white paper defines ffo as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciated property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for third party shares of appropriate items 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in consolidated net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult 
for informational purposes  we have also provided ffo adjusted for a non cash impairment charge recorded in we believe this supplemental information provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definitions differently than we do 
our calculation of ffo and reconciliation to consolidated net loss income is as follows funds from operations year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  consolidated net loss income add loss deduct gain on sale of operating property less non cash gain from consolidation of subsidiary  net of noncontrolling interests less gain on sale of unconsolidated property less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in properties add depreciation and amortization of consolidated entities  net of noncontrolling interests add depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated entities funds from operations of the kite portfolio less redeemable noncontrolling interests in funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company funds from operations of the kite portfolio add back non cash loss on impairment of real estate asset funds from operations of the kite portfolio excluding non cash loss on impairment of real estate asset funds from operations of the kite portfolio measures of the operating performance of the operating partnership s real estate properties and construction and service subsidiaries in which the company owns an interest

as a matter of policy  we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative transactions 
inflation most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance 
this helps reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
