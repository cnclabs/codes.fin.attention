item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system 
our products are sold in over countries throughout the world and are used to treat arterial blockages in the heart and legs as well as the removal of problematic pacemaker and defibrillator leads 
approximately one half of our disposable product revenue is from products used in connection with our proprietary excimer laser system  the cvx 
our single use laser catheters contain up to small diameter  flexible optical fibers that can access difficult to reach peripheral and coronary anatomy and produce evenly distributed laser energy at the tip of the catheter for more uniform ablation 
we believe that our excimer laser system is the only laser system approved in the united states  europe  japan and canada for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures 
recent new product introductions in january  we received clearance from the fda to market the redesigned turbo tandem  a single use  disposable device indicated for atherectomy of infrainguinal leg arteries 
the turbo tandem system is comprised of two integrated devices  a french laser guide catheter integrated with a mm equivalent laser catheter 
the turbo tandem is designed to create larger lumens to perform atherectomy and ablation of plaque in arterial lesions above the knee  primarily within the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries  restoring blood flow to the lower extremities 
the angled ramp at the tip of the guide catheter allows the physician circumferential guidance and positioning of the laser catheter within the vessel  and push button control greatly simplifies use of the turbo tandem for repeated passes through the vessel 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a limited market release of the first version of the turbo tandem which was cleared by the fda in july based on physician feedback during the limited market release  we decided to make certain changes to the design of the product before the full commercial launch 
we commenced the commercial launch of the redesigned turbo tandem throughout the united states in march in december  we introduced the full line of quick cross select and the new quick cross extreme product lines 
the quick cross select and extreme product lines are intended for use to guide and support a guidewire during access of the vasculature  allow for wire exchanges and provide a conduit for the delivery of saline solutions or diagnostic contrast agents 
the quick cross extreme is designed to facilitate the crossing of blockages in the legs and features a braided catheter and a straight tip 
the braided catheter jacket improves strength and pushability 
the quick cross select is a braided support catheter offering an angled tip configuration  which allows for quicker access into branched anatomy 
these were extensions of the previous quick cross product line and are available for   and guidewire compatibility in cm  cm  cm  and cm lengths 
in december  we received fda k clearance for our visisheath dilator sheath device  which expands the market for visisheath  which also received ce mark approval in europe in the visisheath dilator sheath may be used alone as an independent sheath for dilating tissue surrounding cardiac leads  or as an enhanced outer support sheath in conjunction with compatible inner sheaths such as the sls ii 
the visisheath dilator sheath is an enhanced tool to help physicians free cardiac leads from binding scar tissue that makes removal challenging by dilating the affected area 
the visisheath device employs unique gold coated steel marker bands to provide physicians with more than percent better fluoroscopic visibility of the device tip than standard teflon or polypropylene sheaths 
an advanced multi layer construction and robust tip design deliver high performance for navigating over leads and dilating tissue 
in june  we received ce mark approval for our thromcat xt thrombus removal system  a single use  disposable device indicated for mechanical removal of thrombus from native coronary arteries and infrainguinal arteries 
we immediately commenced the commercial launch of the product 
table of contents within the european union 
the approval triggered a milestone payment of million pursuant to our amended development and regulatory services agreement with kensey nash corporation 
the thromcat xt was an improvement to the current thromcat system with enhanced thrombus removal and several advancements in ease of use  including an improved braid reinforced  kink resistant catheter jacket and a more robust helix 
the thromcat xt system generates a consistent vacuum pressure at the tip of the catheter to draw thrombus into the extraction ports where it is then macerated by an internal helix 
without further contact with the blood stream  the thrombus is then transported to an external collection bag 
pending clinical indications in september  we filed a k application with the fda seeking clearance for the treatment of in stent restenosis isr in the legs with our commercially available peripheral atherectomy products 
isr is caused by the re growth of tissue within the stent  known as neointimal hyperplasia  which can lead to blockages in the affected leg artery 
the k application makes reference to the results of bench testing associated with the interaction of laser and nitinol stents 
this testing shows that stents subjected to extensive fatigue testing following laser interaction had no fatigue related failures 
the submission also includes reference to clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of excimer laser treatment in coronary artery isr and an analysis of interim data from the peripheral artery isr study  patent  which is ongoing in germany 
in response to our submission  we have received questions from the fda and are in the process of preparing our responses 
there can be no assurances that we will receive clearance from the fda for the treatment of isr 
recent clinical trials in may  we announced initial data from the four year  retrospective lead extraction in contemporary settings lexicon study  and final results were published in february in the journal of the american college of cardiology 
the study examined laser assisted lead removal of  leads in  patients at centers between january and december  using the sls ii laser sheath 
the study demonstrated a compelling low rate of complication with a major adverse event rate and mortality rate  which represented a relative reduction and more than relative reduction  respectively  compared to a previous multi center study evaluating the original sls laser sheath 
efficacy results were very strong with a clinical success rate 
details from the study were presented at the heart rhythm society hrs meeting in boston in may  where hrs introduced their updated guidelines related to extraction of pacemaker and defibrillator leads 
these guidelines expanded the specific clinical circumstances where a lead extraction should be considered from to we believe this data adds strongly to the clinical evidence supporting the safety of laser assisted lead removal and will be instrumental in reshaping perceptions around this procedure as a mainstream treatment option for device patients 
in december  the cello trial data was published in the journal of endovascular therapy 
the cello study evaluated the effectiveness of excimer laser ablation with the turbo booster for patients with pad 
the fda cleared laser treatment met its primary endpoint by reducing  on average  the percent diameter stenosis from percent to percent immediately post turbo booster use  easily exceeding the goal of a percent difference 
additionally  the turbo booster had a low number of repeat vascular interventions  while safely improving a range of clinical and functional status assessments 
kensey nash acquisition in may  we completed the acquisition of the endovascular business of kensey nash corporation knc  which included all of the assets related to knc s quickcat  thromcat and safe cross product lines  for million in cash 
the primary reason for the acquisition of these product lines was to leverage our existing sales organization while extending our product offering in the 
table of contents area of thrombus management 
we agreed to pay knc an additional million based on product development  regulatory and sales milestones 
of the million  up to million is payable based on various product development and regulatory milestones associated with the acquired products  and million is payable once cumulative sales of the acquired products reach million 
as of december   we have paid million of the product development and regulatory milestones 
the first milestone payment of million was made in october the second milestone  related to obtaining ce mark approval for the next generation thromcat device  the thromcat xt  was achieved by knc in june  which triggered another million payment 
as of december   cumulative sales of the acquired products were million 
during the third quarter of  we completed a physician preference testing ppt with the objective of having physicians evaluate the performance of the next generation safe cross product safe cross tlx 
the results of this ppt phase indicated that the improvements included in safe cross tlx did not generate a significant improvement in outcomes  and it became clear that the changes to the product would not drive significant adoption relative to other alternatives 
as a result  in the third quarter  we determined that further development and sales of the product should be discontinued 
see further discussion of the discontinuation of safe cross in results of operations and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
in december  we transferred the manufacturing of the quickcat products from knc to our facility 
we continue to purchase the thromcat products from knc  and we pay knc transfer prices for the thromcat based on the cost to manufacture the products plus a percentage of the sales of the thromcat 
additionally  after knc s manufacture of the thromcat products is transferred to us  we will continue to pay knc a share of revenues received from sales of such products 
federal investigation on september   we were jointly served by the fda and the immigration and customs enforcement ice with a search warrant issued by the united states district court  district of colorado 
the search warrant requested information and correspondence relating to i the promotion  use  testing  marketing and sales regarding certain of the company s products for the treatment of in stent restenosis  payments made to medical personnel and an identified institution for this application  ii the promotion  use  testing  experimentation  delivery  marketing and sales of catheter guidewires and balloon catheters manufactured by certain third parties outside of the united states  iii two post market studies completed during the period from to and payments to medical personnel in connection with those studies and iv compensation packages for certain of the company s personnel 
on december   we announced that we had reached a resolution with the united states department of justice doj and the office of inspector general oig of the united states department of health and human services regarding the federal investigation 
we had been cooperating with the investigation since september  as part of the resolution  we entered into a civil settlement agreement  dated december   with the doj and the oig 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  we settled civil and administrative claims related to the federal investigation for a cash payment to the united states government of million  without any admission of wrongdoing by the company 
as part of the settlement agreement  we also expressly denied the contentions of the united states  except those specifically included in the non prosecution agreement  which we entered into on december  with the doj 
pursuant to the terms of the non prosecution agreement  we agreed to a forfeiture of  the doj has agreed not to prosecute the company in return for compliance with the terms of the non prosecution agreement 
there are no criminal charges against the company 

table of contents as part of the resolution  we also agreed to enter into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with oig 
the cia acknowledges the existence of our corporate compliance program and provides for certain other compliance related activities during the five year term of the agreement 
those activities include specific written standards  training  education  review  disclosure and reporting requirements 
the company remains fully eligible to participate in all federal health care programs

table of contents revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is mainly attributable to a increase in disposable products revenue  which consists of single use catheter products  and a increase in service and other revenue  partially offset by a decrease in laser revenue 
our product mix changed slightly year over year  with of revenue coming from disposables in compared with from disposables in service and other revenue represented of total revenue in as compared to of revenue in revenue from laser sales and rentals decreased to of total revenue in from of total revenue in we separate our disposable products revenue into two separate categories vascular intervention vi and lead management lm 
for the year ended december   our vi revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue and our lm revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue 
for  our vi revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue and our lm revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue 
vi revenue  which includes products used in both the peripheral and coronary vascular systems  grew from to the increased vi revenue is due to unit volume increases in addition to price increases 
approximately one half of the increase was due to price increases implemented at the beginning of vi sales include three product categories atherectomy  which decreased  crossing solutions  which increased  and thrombectomy  which increased  all compared with we believe the decrease in atherectomy product sales is primarily due to the current competitive environment in peripheral atherectomy procedures  particularly those performed below the knee 
the increase in thrombectomy was primarily due to the first full year of revenue from the endovascular product lines acquired from kensey nash corporation in may  which totaled million in compared to million from may to december  lm revenue grew in as compared with we continue to believe our lm revenue is increasing primarily as a result of our expanded sales organization  which was initially established in  clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of removing problematic pacemaker and defibrillator leads  including results from the recently concluded lexicon registry  and favorable market dynamics due to recently expanded guidelines set forth by the hrs for lead extractions 
we estimate that the majority of replaced pacemaker or defibrillator leads are capped and left in the body 
we have established a dedicated lead management sales organization to increase awareness of potential complications associated with leaving abandoned or non functioning leads in the body  in addition to other market development activities 
laser revenue was million and million for and  respectively 
equipment sales revenue  which is included in laser revenue  decreased from we sold fourteen laser systems in twelve from inventory  two rental conversions as compared to thirty two laser systems twenty six from inventory  six rental conversions in the prior year 
we believe the decline in laser sales was due primarily to reduced capital budgets at hospitals in light of current economic conditions 
rental revenue increased in as compared to the prior year 
this increase is due primarily to the increase in our installed rental base of laser systems  which increased from at december  to at december   as well as our focus on converting under performing cap free lasers to straight rentals 
service and other revenue increased  to million in from million in  due primarily to our increased installed base of laser systems 
we placed laser systems with new customers during compared with during the prior year 
of those new laser placements  laser systems were transfers from the existing installed base in compared with transfers in in recent quarters  we have placed more focus on redeploying laser systems from hospitals with low laser based catheter utilization to hospitals where we believe 
table of contents utilization will be higher  in order to increase productivity per laser system 
both our focus on redeploying laser systems and our emphasis on increasing sales to existing accounts have resulted in fewer net new placements as compared to year ago periods  which was anticipated 
this brings our worldwide installed base of laser systems to in the us at december  on a geographic basis  revenue in the united states was million in  an increase of from the prior year 
international revenue totaled million  an increase of from in europe and the middle east emea  the increase in international revenue was led by sales of thrombectomy products acquired in may  which increased to million in from million in the period from may to december  as well as an increase in both vi and lm product sales 
in addition  sales to the asia pacific latin america sector apla increased year over year  with increases across all product lines  particularly in laser sales 
gross margin in was  a decrease of less than one percentage point as compared with in the gross margin decline was due primarily to a less favorable margin mix of product revenues within vi disposable product sales 
in  as compared to  we experienced growth in our non laser disposables  including support catheters and thrombectomy products  which carry lower gross margins than our laser based catheters 
additionally  laser margins were lower than in the previous year due primarily to fewer laser sales  which carry higher margins than laser rentals  as compared to the year ago period 
operating expenses operating expenses of million in increased from million in operating expenses in and include a number of special items which are separately disclosed components within operating expenses in our statement of operations 
in  these special items totaled million  compared to million in  and they are further described below 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research  development and other technology increased by as compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to marketing and selling expenses increased approximately or million  to million from million in  primarily as a result of the following increased personnel related costs of approximately million associated with the staffing of additional employees within our us field sales organization in as compared with the same period of the prior year 
these costs include salaries and related taxes  recruiting  and travel costs 
increased incentive compensation of approximately million  which is mainly due to the increase in revenues and additional employees 
increased marketing expenses of approximately million  due primarily to new product launches and anticipated new product launches 
approximately million in increased sales related costs for our international operations  due primarily to incremental expenses for sales and marketing activities related to the acquired kensey nash products in europe  acquired in may  in addition to higher sales and commissions expense due to the increase in revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately or million  to million in from million in  due primarily to costs associated with enhancing our regulatory compliance programs and resources 

table of contents research and development 
research  development and other technology expenses of approximately million in increased compared to costs included within research  development and other technology expenses are product costs  clinical studies costs and royalty costs associated with various license agreements with third party licensors 
fluctuations in these costs are as follows personnel related costs and outside contractor services increased by million due primarily to a year over year increase in headcount of three employees 
these costs include salaries and related taxes  recruiting  and travel costs 
clinical studies expenses decreased approximately million as compared to the prior year  due in part to the timing of completion of certain clinical studies 
product development costs increased by approximately million compared to related to the design of the turbo tandem and other development projects 
royalty expenses increased by approximately million due to higher sales of products incorporating technology that we license 
purchased in process research and development 
included in the results for is million of in process research and development expense acquired from knc as part of the endovascular product line acquisition 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established  including technology relating to products that have not received fda approval and which has no alternative future use 
during the remainder of and  there was no material change in the status of the project that provided the basis for the value assigned to acquired in process technology 
federal investigation settlement 
in december  we reached a resolution with the federal government regarding the previously discussed federal investigation 
as part of the resolution  we entered into a non prosecution agreement with the doj and we agreed to a forfeiture of  and the doj has agreed not to prosecute the company in return for compliance with the terms of the agreement 
in addition  we entered into a civil settlement agreement with the doj and the oig  pursuant to which we settled civil and administrative claims related to the federal investigation for a cash payment to the united states government of million  without any admission of wrongdoing by the company 
see further discussion of this matter in note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
federal investigation legal and other costs 
legal and other expenses related to the federal investigation which began in september were approximately million in both and since the investigation began  we have incurred a total of million in legal and other expenses related to the federal investigation 
in the fourth quarter of  we received an insurance payment of approximately million which reimbursed certain costs related to the federal investigation previously expensed during the year 
litigation settlement 
the million included in this line item represents the current year provision for royalties related to a patent license agreement with dr 
rentrop  which was negotiated as part of a litigation settlement and which we paid in december the total amount paid in december was million  which included the current year provision and million accrued as royalty expense in prior periods 
see further discussion of this matter in note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
discontinuation costs safe cross product line 
in the third quarter of  we decided to discontinue the marketing and sales of the safe cross product line  which was acquired from knc in may the million charge includes a patent impairment charge in the amount of million  impairment of long lived assets in the amount of million  inventory write offs of million and an amount in consideration of estimated remaining obligations to knc and customers of million 

table of contents see further discussion of the discontinuation costs in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
employee termination and lease abandonment costs 
in the second and third quarters of  we eliminated certain positions in order to streamline operations 
as a result  we recorded severance obligations totaling  for the year ended december  in addition  we recorded a charge for remaining lease obligations in the amount of  for a portion of a leased facility that is no longer being utilized 
loss on sale of auction rate securities 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold two of our auction rate securities at and of par  respectively 
the amounts recorded represent the realized loss on the sale of these securities  which were recorded on our balance sheet at of par at the date of sale 
other than temporary impairment of auction rate securities 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that our remaining auction rate securities were other than temporarily impaired  due to a change by management regarding our intent to hold such investments until a full recovery of their par value 
the million recorded represents the impairment calculated by an independent consultant 
see further discussion of our auction rate securities in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
interest income interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income in is due primarily to lower interest rates on our invested balances and a lower investment portfolio balance 
loss before income taxes pre tax loss for the year ended december  was million  compared with a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  the current period results included million of special items  in addition to million of losses related to our auction rate securities 
the prior year results included million of special items  as described above 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of million comprised of state and foreign income taxes payable 
we did not recognize any deferred tax benefit during the year  as we recorded an additional valuation allowance to fully reserve the deferred tax benefits arising from our pretax loss for  based on our analysis of the realizability of our deferred tax asset 
this determination was based primarily on our forecast of available taxable income in future years 
based on our analysis  we expect that it is more likely than not that we will realize the deferred tax asset  net of valuation allowance  recorded on the balance sheet as of december  net loss income we recorded a net loss for year ended december  of million  or per fully diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per fully diluted share  in the functional currency of spectranetics international bv and spectranetics deutschland gmbh is the euro 
all revenue and expenses are translated to us dollars in the consolidated statements of operations using weighted average exchange rates during the year

revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is mainly attributable to a increase in disposable products revenue  which consists of single use catheter products  and a increase in laser revenue 
our product mix remained relatively consistent from to  with of our revenue coming from disposables  from laser sales and rentals  and of revenue from service and other 
for the year  our vi revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue and our lm revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue 
for the 
table of contents year  our vi revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue and our lm revenue totaled million of our disposable products revenue 
vi revenue grew in as compared with vi revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases in our quick cross support catheter  unit volume increases from the continued penetration of our peripheral laser atherectomy product lines  as well as post acquisition date revenue from the endovascular product lines acquired from kensey nash corporation on may  vi revenue growth in slowed in comparison to due primarily to what we believe is a heightened competitive environment in atherectomy procedures  particularly those performed below the knee 
lead management revenue grew for the year ended december   as compared with the year 
we believe our lm revenue increased primarily as a result of the increase in the use of icds  devices that regulate heart rhythm 
laser equipment revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
laser sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  increased to million in from million in we sold laser systems as outright sales from inventory and six conversions from rental systems during as compared to laser systems as outright sales from inventory and six sales conversions from rental systems during rental revenue increased during  from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to the increase in our installed rental base of laser systems  which increased from at december  to at december  service and other revenue increased to million in as compared to million in the increase was due primarily to the increased installed base of laser systems 
our worldwide installed base of laser systems which includes outright sales  rental systems and evaluation systems increased by during  compared with an increase of laser systems last year 
this brought our worldwide installed base of laser systems to in the us at december  gross margin for was  a decrease of two percentage points as compared with in the gross margin decline was due to higher facilities and quality assurance costs as compared with the year ago period some of which were associated with our move to a new facility in  and within disposables  a less favorable margin mix of product revenues 
in  we experienced slower growth in our higher margin laser catheters and relatively stronger growth in support catheters  which carry a slightly lower margin percentage  as well as thrombectomy products  manufactured by kensey nash  and which carry a lower margin 
additionally  laser and service margins were slightly lower than in the previous year 
operating expenses operating expenses of million in increased from million in this increase was mainly due to a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and a increase in research  development and other technology expenses relative to the prior year  as well as million of in process research and development acquired from kensey nash in the second quarter of in addition  legal and other costs related to the federal investigation in were million 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to marketing and selling expenses increased approximately or million in compared with the prior year primarily as a result of the following increased personnel related costs of approximately million associated with the staffing of additional employees within our us field sales and marketing organizations in as compared with average sales and marketing headcount in was compared

increased expenses of approximately million in other expenses  including depreciation  amortization  and materials 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately or million in compared with the prior year  primarily the result of the following increased personnel related costs of approximately million associated with the staffing of additional employees in our general and administrative departments as of the end of as compared with these costs include salaries and related taxes  benefits  recruiting  and travel costs 
increased expenses of approximately million related to outside consulting expenses due to various projects related to the needs of our expanding workforce and information technology infrastructure 
increased depreciation  insurance and other facilities related expenses of approximately million 
increased legal expense of approximately million  primarily due to costs related to the appeal of the rentrop verdict see note  commitments and contingencies 
increased bad debt expense of million 
the above increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately million included in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to the prior year  due to higher than anticipated forfeitures in in addition  legal and other costs related to the federal investigation in were million  with no corresponding expense in see note  commitments and contingencies 
research and development 
included in the results for was million of in process research and development expense acquired from knc as part of the endovascular product line acquisition  which is discussed in more detail in note  business combination  to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established  including technology relating to products that have not received fda approval and which has no alternative future use 
during the third and fourth quarters of  there was no material change in the status of the project that provided the basis for the value assigned to acquired in process technology 
research  development and other technology expenses of million for represented an increase of from million in costs included within research  development and other technology expenses are research and development costs  clinical studies costs and royalty costs 
table of contents associated with various license agreements with third party licensors 
the million increase is primarily due to increased personnel related costs including recruiting and travel of approximately million due primarily to the hiring of nine additional engineering  regulatory and clinical studies employees since the prior year 
increased clinical studies and regulatory expenses of approximately million related to a number of clinical studies being conducted by us that are in various stages of completion  as well as activities related to regulatory compliance 
increased royalty expenses of approximately million due to higher sales of products incorporating technology that we license 
increased prototype materials  depreciation and other facilities related expenses of approximately million due to increased r d project activity for both laser systems and disposables 
the above increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately million included in research and development expenses in as compared to the prior year 
interest income interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income in is due primarily to a lower investment portfolio balance  primarily as a result of the million paid to knc in for the endovascular product line acquisition 
lower interest rates on our invested balances also contributed to the decline in interest income 
loss before income taxes pre tax loss for was million  compared with pre tax income of million for the results included the million in process research and development charge and million of legal and other costs related to the federal investigation noted above 
given the company s significant historical net operating losses which are available to offset future taxable income  any income tax expense or benefit is a non cash item 
as a result  management believes that pre tax income or loss is the most appropriate measure of its operating performance 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a net income tax benefit of million against our pretax loss of million 
included in the net tax benefit for was a non cash tax benefit of million related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
this adjustment was made as a result of our quarterly assessment of our deferred tax asset  and the reasons for the adjustment are discussed in more detail in note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the valuation allowance adjustment  for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million against our pretax income for the period 
a portion of the company s granted stock options qualify as incentive stock options iso for income tax purposes 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
due to the treatment of incentive stock options for tax purposes  our effective tax rate is subject to variability 

table of contents net loss we recorded a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or per fully diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per fully diluted share  in the results included the million in process research and development charge and million of legal and other costs related to the federal investigation noted above  and the results included a non cash tax benefit of million related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current investment securities available for sale of million  down million from december  as of december   we had long term investment securities of million  a decrease of million from million at december  long term investment securities at december  consisted of our auction rate securities ars which we acquired in january and which are currently illiquid 
we sold two of these securities at and of par  respectively  in the fourth quarter of  for cash proceeds of million 
we also received partial redemptions of million on two of the issues of these securities  at par  in in march  we sold a third security at of par  for cash proceeds of million 
see further discussion of our ars in note  investment securities  to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  if these markets deteriorate further or if we experience rating downgrades on any investments in our portfolio  including our ars  the market value of our investment portfolio may decline further 
this would negatively affect our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
although we currently believe that our cash  cash equivalents and current investment securities balances at december  are sufficient to fund our 
table of contents operations through at least the next twelve months  the outcome of the shareholder and derivative litigation and our obligations to indemnify and advance the legal expenses of our present and former directors  officers and agents are uncertain and may require resources beyond what we have currently available 
we cannot provide assurances that debt or equity financing  if needed  would be available on favorable terms  if at all 
operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities totaled million 
the primary uses of cash were the following the net loss of million  offset by million of non cash expenses  which included million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation expense  provision for excess and obsolete inventories  million of realized loss on the sale of our auction rate securities  million of other than temporary impairment of our auction rate securities  and million of non cash charges related to the discontinuation of the safe cross product line 
the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million was due primarily to the following an increase in equipment held for rental or loan of million as a result of expanding placement activity of our laser systems through our rental and evaluation programs  an increase in trade accounts receivable of approximately million  due primarily to higher revenue in compared to the prior year  an increase in inventory of approximately million  largely in disposables inventory  due primarily to the introduction and build up of new products  and slightly higher stocking levels to meet the increase in catheter demand  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  related primarily to a payment to dr 
rentrop of million related to our negotiated patent agreement  offset by increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments and overall increase in spending in  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million  due to fewer laser sales and therefore fewer warranties and service plans sold in compared to the prior year 
the table below presents the change in receivables and inventory in relative terms  through the presentation of financial ratios 
days sales outstanding are calculated by dividing the ending accounts receivable balance  net of reserves for sales returns and doubtful accounts  by the average daily sales for the quarter 
inventory turns are calculated by dividing annualized cost of sales for the quarter by ending inventory 
december  december  days sales outstanding inventory turns investing activities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities was million  consisting of proceeds from the maturity  sale or redemption of investment securities  including the sale of two of our auction rate securities  of million and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
these cash in flows were partially offset by capital expenditures of million  a milestone payment to kensey nash corporation of million  and two acquisitions of patents for a total of million 
the decrease in restricted cash was due to a payment made to dr 
rentrop related to the patent litigation for its restricted purpose  see note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report for more information 
the capital expenditures included manufacturing capacity expansion projects as well as additional capital items for research and development projects and additional computer equipment purchases 

table of contents financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  comprised entirely of proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees  former employees and directors as a result of exercises of stock options and stock issuance under our employee stock purchase plan 
at december   we had no significant debt or capital lease obligations 
capital resources during the years ended december  and  we purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of property and equipment for cash 
during and we also invested approximately million and million  respectively  in laser equipment held for rental or loan under our rental and evaluation programs these amounts are included in cash flows from operating activities 
we expect to fund any capital expenditures in from cash and cash equivalents 
contractual obligations the company leases office space  furniture  vehicles and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with initial terms that expire at various dates through purchase obligations consist of purchase orders issued primarily for inventory 
royalty obligations represent the minimum royalties due under license agreements 
the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases and purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands total one year or less years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations royalty obligations total off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or that are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those relating to the carrying amount of our investments in auction rate securities  the carrying amount of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances and reserves for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical 
table of contents experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and the carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title transfers 
in general  customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund 
however  we allow returns under certain circumstances and record a provision for sales returns based on historical returns experience 
revenue from the sale of excimer laser systems is recognized after completion of contractual obligations  which generally include delivery and installation of the systems 
our field service engineers are responsible for installation of each laser 
we generally provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  labor and replacement gas 
upon expiration of the warranty period  we offer similar service to our customers under service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
we recognize revenue from fee for service arrangements upon completion of the related service 
we account for service provided during the one year warranty or service contract period as a separate unit of accounting in accordance with us gaap 
as such  we defer the fair value of this service and recognize it as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty or service contract period and warranty and service costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
revenue allocated to the laser element is recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations in the sales contract  which generally include delivery and installation of the laser system 
in addition to the sale of laser systems  we also offer laser system placement programs  including flat rate rentals and variable depending on catheter purchases rentals for which we invoice the customer and recognize revenue on a monthly or quarterly basis 
we also offer a cap free program under which the customer does not pay a rental fee  but agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
we recognize the total surcharge as rental revenue upon shipment of the catheters  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser system each month 
under the laser system placement programs  the laser system is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and the depreciation expense related to the system is included in cost of revenue based upon a five year expected life of the laser system 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we sell to end users in the united states and internationally as well as to certain international distributors 
sales to international distributors represented approximately of our worldwide sales in and distributor agreements are in place with each distributor  which outline the significant terms of the transactions between the distributor and the company 
the terms and conditions of sales to our international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
sales to distributors are recognized either at shipment or a later date in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors  provided that we have received an order  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  all contractual obligations have been met and we can reasonably estimate returns 
we provide products to our distributors at agreed wholesale prices and do not typically provide any special right of return or exchange  discounts  significant sales incentives  price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based upon an analysis of revenue transactions and historical experience of sales returns and price adjustments 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
although we 
table of contents believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use judgment in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable  historical experience and the overall quality of the receivables 
we review individual accounts receivable balances for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is remote 
we believe our estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable are reasonable  however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  significant additional allowances could be required 
inventory reserves 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based on historical usage and sales  as well as assumptions about future demand for our products 
we review and update our estimates for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for product demand are consistent with our sales forecasts and are also used for near term production planning and inventory purchasing 
increases in the inventory reserves result in a corresponding expense to cost of goods sold 
we believe that our estimates for obsolete and excess inventory are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation 
however  other factors  such as future product introductions  the introduction of competing technologies or changes in market demand  may require additional reserves  which could have a material effect on gross margins in any given period 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which may involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
stock based compensation 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using either the black scholes options pricing model or a trinomial lattice model  both of which require management s estimates and assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including volatility  expected term of the options  and other inputs 
in recognizing stock based compensation expense  we also estimate future forfeitures based on historical forfeiture data 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current and prior periods and could materially affect our results of operations 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december   we have a net 
table of contents deferred tax asset of million 
based primarily on our projections of future taxable income  we believe that it is more likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized  but there can be no assurances that our estimates are accurate or that our assumptions will not change 
valuation of purchased in process research and development iprd 
when we acquired the kensey nash endovascular product line in the second quarter of  the purchase price was allocated based upon the fair value of tangible assets  iprd  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with us gaap applicable at that time 
we recognized million of iprd for the portion of the purchase price allocated to the appraised value of in process technologies  defined as those technologies relating to products that had not received fda approval and had no alternative future use 
such valuations require the use of significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to iprd was determined by estimating future cash flows of the technology and discounting net cash flows back to present values 
we considered  among other things  the project s stage of completion  complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  costs already incurred  projected costs to complete  contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition was based on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk 
during and  there was no material change in the status of the project that provided the basis for the value assigned to acquired in process technology 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and we review them for impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we amortize our intangible assets  which consist primarily of patents  using the straight line method over periods which currently range from to years 
management must use significant estimates and assumptions in evaluating whether or not impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets has occurred  and in evaluating the useful lives of amortized intangible assets 
significant changes in these estimates and management s assumptions may reduce the carrying amount of these intangible assets 
valuation of auction rate securities ars 
the fair value for our ars at december  is based on a third party pricing model and is classified as a level pricing category in accordance with the accounting rules for fair value measurements 
we utilized a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair market value for each of the securities we owned as there was little recent activity in the secondary markets in these types of securities 
this model used unique inputs for each security including discount rate  interest rate currently being paid and estimated date to liquidation 
the discount rates ranged from to 
in order to calculate the discount rate  we estimated the expected yield on an average high grade municipal bond 
in our view  high grade municipal bonds are the most closely comparable security to the auction rate securities contained in our portfolio because they have similar credit quality and are government backed  as is the substantial portion of our ars portfolio through the ffelp program 
we utilized forecasts for the month libor based on the forecasted data from wolters kluwer blue chip financial forecasts  then estimated the spread between the month libor and a high grade municipal bond to be basis points  based on current and historical market data 
because we are currently unable to withdraw from the securities  we also added a basis points illiquidity premium to the discount rate 
for one of our securities  which has a credit rating from moody s of a  we also included a basis point premium to reflect the security s lower credit rating 

table of contents the estimated liquidation dates used in the valuation analysis were years from the balance sheet date 
at december   we also performed a sensitivity analysis in the valuation of our ars using an estimated date to liquidation of plus or minus one year and a discount rate of plus or minus basis points 
the sensitivity analysis with these parameters calculated a valuation ranging from million to million 
we believe that our current valuation of million is a reasonable measure of fair value of the securities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts and our estimates are subject to change 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and related disclosures 
this new guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted this new guidance on january   as required for our financial assets and financial liabilities 
however  the fasb deferred the effective date of this new guidance for one year as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
we adopted these remaining provisions on january  the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the accounting for business combinations and related disclosures 
this new guidance addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interests in business combinations 
the guidance also establishes expanded disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the guidance was effective on january   and we will apply this new guidance prospectively to all business combinations subsequent to the effective date 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of recognized intangible assets 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures concerning a company s treatment of costs incurred to renew or extend the term of a recognized intangible asset 
we adopted this guidance as of january   and it had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to fair value measurements  the recognition of other than temporary impairments  and interim disclosures about the fair values of financial instruments 
this provides additional guidance in fair value measurements in markets which are not active  and in determining whether impairments in debt securities are other than temporary 
it also requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments whenever a public company issues financial information for interim reporting periods 
this guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending after june  we adopted this guidance and its disclosure requirements in the second quarter of  and it had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which establishes general standards of accounting for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
we adopted this guidance in the second quarter of and its adoption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification asc or codification  officially released on july   as the sole source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles used by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements 
the codification is meant to simplify the authoritative accounting guidance by reorganizing us gaap pronouncements into roughly accounting topics within a consistent structure 
the codification 
table of contents supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards and was effective for us beginning july  in october  an update was made to asc  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
it also replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurements required under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance  eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation  and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements 
this update is effective for us beginning january   and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
we are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this update will have  if any  on our consolidated financial position and results of operations when it becomes effective in in january  the fasb issued guidance that requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures that are effective for annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we attempt to place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities  which consist of both fixed and variable rate financial instruments 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with temporary unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity  net of applicable taxes 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the value of our investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
we hold million in auction rate securities ars  classified as long term on our balance sheet as of december   and changes in interest rates and other assumptions in the valuation of these securities may have a significant impact on their valuation 
the underlying assets of the auction rate securities we hold are student loans which are guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
beginning in february  auctions failed for these holdings because sell orders exceeded buy orders 
the funds associated with these securities will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures 
as of december   the unrealized loss on our ars was approximately million  reducing the million par value of the securities to their fair value of million 
in  we determined that this impairment was other than temporary and recorded a million charge to our consolidated statement of operations 
at december   we also performed a sensitivity analysis in the valuation of our ars using an estimated date to liquidation of plus or minus one year and a discount rate of plus or minus basis points 
the sensitivity analysis with these parameters calculated a valuation ranging from million to million 
see further discussion of our ars above under 
table of contents item  critical accounting polices  and in note  investment securities  to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is primarily related to sales of our products in europe  which are denominated in the euro 
changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our revenue and net income 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves and our products continue to be introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
for the year ended december   approximately million of decreased revenue and million of decreased operating expenses were the result of exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to the euro as compared to the prior year 
accordingly  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on consolidated net income for the year ended december  was a decrease in net income of million as compared to the prior year
