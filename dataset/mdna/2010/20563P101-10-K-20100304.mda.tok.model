our security products segment  with a manufacturing facility in south carolina and one in illinois shared with marine components  manufactures locking mechanisms and other security products for sale to the postal  transportation  office and institutional furniture  toolbox  banking  vending  general cabinetry and other industries 
we believe we are a north american market leader in the manufacture and sale of cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms 
our security products are used in a variety of applications including ignition systems  mailboxes  toolboxes  vending and gaming machines  parking meters  electrical circuit panels  storage compartments  office furniture and medical cabinet security 
these products include disc tumbler locks which provide moderate security and generally represent the lowest cost lock to produce  pin tumbler locking mechanisms which are more costly to produce and are used in applications requiring higher levels of security  including our keset high security system  which allows the user to change the keying on a single lock times without removing the lock from its enclosure  and our innovative elock electronic locks which provide stand alone or networked security and audit trail capability for drug storage and other valuables through the use of a proximity card  magnetic stripe or keypad credentials 
a substantial portion of our security products sales consist of products with specialized adaptations to an individual manufacturer s specifications  some of which are listed above 
we also have a standardized product line suitable for many customers  which is offered through a north american distribution network to lock distributors and smaller original equipment manufacturers oems via our stock locks distribution program

marine components 
our marine components segment  with a facility in wisconsin and a facility in illinois shared with security products  manufactures and distributes marine instruments  hardware and accessories for performance boats 
our specialty marine component products are high performance components designed to operate within precise tolerances in the highly corrosive marine environment 
these products include original equipment and aftermarket stainless steel exhaust headers  exhaust pipes  mufflers and other exhaust components  high performance gauges such as gps speedometers and tachometers  controls  throttles  steering wheels and other billet accessories  and dash panels  led lighting  rigging and other accessories 
our business segments operated six manufacturing facilities at december  including one facility in grayslake  illinois that houses operations relating to security products and marine components

security products furniture components marine components mauldin  sc grayslake  il kitchener  ontario byron center  mi taipei  taiwan neenah  wi grayslake  il raw materials our primary raw materials are zinc  copper and brass used in the security products segment for the manufacture of locking mechanisms  coiled steel used in the furniture components segment for the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems  stainless steel used in the marine components segment for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and other components  and plastic resins used primarily in the furniture components segment for injection molded plastics employed in the manufacturing of ergonomic computer support systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately of our total cost of sales for we occasionally enter into raw material arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw materials that are affected by commodity markets 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified purchase volumes 
we utilize purchase arrangements to stabilize our commodity related raw material prices provided we meet the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities 
commodity related raw materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
consequently  overall operating margins can be affected by commodity related raw material cost pressures 
commodity market prices are cyclical  reflecting overall economic trends and specific developments in consuming industries 
patents and trademarks we hold a number of patents relating to our component products  certain of which are believed to be important to us and our continuing business activity 
patents generally have a term of years  and our patents have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to years at december  our major trademarks and brand names include furniture components security products marine components compx precision slides compx security products custom marine compx waterloo national cabinet lock livorsi marine compx ergonomx fort lock cmi industrial mufflers compx durislide timberline custom marine stainless dynaslide chicago lock exhaust waterloo furniture stock locks the choice in components limited keset performance boating tubar mega rim ace ii race rim compx elock compx marine lockview software sales  marketing and distribution 
we sell components directly to large oem customers through our factory based sales and marketing professionals and with engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturers representatives 
we select manufacturers representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers 
a significant portion of our sales are also made through distributors 
we have a significant market share of cabinet lock sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel 
we support our distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace 
these products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users 
due to our success with the stock locks inventory program within the security products segment  similar programs have been implemented for distributor sales of ergonomic computer support systems within the furniture components segment 
in  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total sales  however  no one customer accounted for sales of or more in of the of total sales  customers was related to security products sales and customers was related to furniture components sales  including customers for which we sell both security products and furniture components 
overall  our customer base is diverse and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
competition the markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of product design  including ergonomic and aesthetic factors  product quality and durability  price  on time delivery  service and technical support 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segments of the market  where product design  quality  durability and service are valued by the customer 
our marine components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors 
our security products and furniture components segments compete against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers 
international operations we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally furniture component operations in canada and taiwan 
the majority of our non us sales are to customers located in canada 
these operations are subject to  among other things  currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our results of operations have in the past been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
political and economic uncertainties in certain of the countries in which we operate may expose us to risk of loss 
we do not believe that there is currently any likelihood of material loss through political or economic instability  seizure  nationalization or similar event 
we cannot predict  however  whether events of this type in the future could have a material effect on our operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory and environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  generation  transportation  treatment  emission  discharge  disposal  remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non hazardous substances  materials and wastes environmental laws 
our operations also are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations 
to date  the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results 
we currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters  however  it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures 
employees as of december   we employed the following number of people united states canada taiwan total approximately of our canadian employees are represented by a labor union covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in january which provides for wage increases from to over the term of the contract

item a 
risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with us and our businesses 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses  or reduced liquidity  could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
many of the markets in which we operate are mature and highly competitive resulting in pricing pressure and the need to continuously reduce costs 
many of the markets we serve are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar products 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segment of the market where we feel that we can compete due to the importance of product design  quality and durability to the customer 
however  our ability to effectively compete is impacted by a number of factors 
the occurrence of any of these factors could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs  especially those sourced from asia 
competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  which may enable them to more effectively withstand changes in market conditions 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the markets in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities to manufacture products that compete with our products 
our ability to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be cost competitive 
our ability to adjust costs relative to our pricing 
customers may no longer value our product design  quality or durability over lower cost products of our competitors 
sales for certain precision slides and ergonomic products are concentrated in the office furniture industry  which has periodically experienced significant reductions in demand that could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
sales of our products to the office furniture manufacturing industry accounted for approximately  and for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
the future growth  if any  of the office furniture industry will be affected by a variety of macroeconomic factors  such as service industry employment levels  corporate cash flows and non residential commercial construction  as well as industry factors such as corporate reengineering and restructuring  technology demands  ergonomic  health and safety concerns and corporate relocations 
there can be no assurance that current or future economic or industry trends will not materially and adversely affect our business 
our failure to enter into new markets with our current businesses would result in the continued significant impact of fluctuations in demand within the office furniture manufacturing industry on our operating results 
in an effort to reduce our dependence on the office furniture market for certain products and to increase our participation in other markets  we have been devoting resources to identify new customers and develop new applications for those products in markets outside of the office furniture industry  such as home appliances  toolboxes and server racks 
developing these new applications for our products involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to our limited experience with customers and applications in these markets as well as facing competitors who are already established in these markets 
we may not be successful in developing new customers or applications for our products outside of the office furniture industry 
significant time may be required to develop new applications and uncertainty exists as to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
our development of innovative features for current products is critical to sustaining and growing our sales 
historically  our ability to provide value added custom engineered products that address requirements of technology and space utilization has been a key element of our success 
we spend a significant amount of time and effort to refine  improve and adapt our existing products for new customers and applications 
since expenditures for these types of activities are not considered research and development expense under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the amount of our research and development expenditures  which is not significant  is not indicative of the overall effort involved in the development of new product features 
the introduction of new product features requires the coordination of the design  manufacturing and marketing of the new product features with current and potential customers 
the ability to coordinate these activities with current and potential customers may be affected by factors beyond our control 
while we will continue to emphasize the introduction of innovative new product features that target customer specific opportunities  there can be no assurance that any new product features we introduce will achieve the same degree of success that we have achieved with our existing products 
introduction of new product features typically requires us to increase production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes  including delays  quality control problems and shortages of qualified personnel or raw materials 
as we attempt to introduce new product features in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase production volume without encountering these or other problems  which might negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
recent and future acquisitions could subject us to a number of operational risks 
a key component of our strategy is to grow and diversify our business through acquisitions 
our ability to successfully execute this component of our strategy entails a number of risks  including the identification of suitable growth opportunities  an inaccurate assessment of acquired liabilities that were undisclosed or not properly disclosed  the entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience  the diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  and an increase in our indebtedness and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed 
higher costs of our raw materials may decrease our liquidity 
certain of the raw materials used in our products are commodities that are subject to significant fluctuations in price in response to world wide supply and demand 
coiled steel is the major raw material used in the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems 
plastic resins for injection molded plastics are also an integral material for ergonomic computer support systems 
zinc is a principal raw material used in the manufacture of security products 
stainless steel tubing is the major raw material used in the manufacture of marine exhaust systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are generally readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
should our vendors not be able to meet their contractual obligations or should we be otherwise unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we may incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels  either of which may decrease our liquidity as we may be unable to offset the higher costs with increased selling prices for our products 
negative worldwide economic conditions could continue to result in a decrease in our sales and an increase in our operating costs  which could continue to adversely affect our business and operating results 
if the current worldwide economic downturn continues  many of our direct and indirect customers may continue to delay or reduce their purchases of the components we manufacture or products that utilize our components 
in addition  many of our customers rely on credit financing for their working capital needs 
if the negative conditions in the global credit markets continue to prevent our customers access to credit  product orders may continue to decrease which could result in lower sales 
likewise  if our suppliers continue to face challenges in obtaining credit  in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses  they may become unable to continue to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products 
these actions could continue to result in reductions in our sales  increased price competition and increased operating costs  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
negative global economic conditions increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers accounts receivable which would adversely affect our financial results 
we extend credit and payment terms to some of our customers 
although we have an ongoing process of evaluating our customers financial condition  we could suffer significant losses if a customer fails and is unable to pay us 
a significant loss of an accounts receivable would have a negative impact on our financial results 
global climate change legislation could negatively impact our financial results or limit our ability to operate our businesses 
we operate production facilities in several countries the united states  canada  and taiwan  and we believe all of our worldwide production facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
in many of the countries in which we operate  legislation has been passed  or proposed legislation is being considered  to limit green house gases through various means  including emissions permits and or energy taxes 
to date the climate change legislation in effect in the various countries in which we operate has not had a material adverse effect on our financial results 
however  if green house gas legislation were to be enacted in one or more countries  it could negatively impact our future results from operations through increased costs of production  particularly as it relates to our energy requirements 
if such increased costs of production were to materialize  we may be unable to pass price increases onto our customers to compensate for increased production costs  which may decrease our liquidity  operating income and results of operations

see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a leading manufacturer of engineered components utilized in a variety of applications and industries 
through our security products segment we manufacture mechanical and electrical cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in postal  office and institutional furniture  transportation  vending  tool storage and other general cabinetry applications 
our furniture components segment manufacturers precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems used in office and institutional furniture  home appliances  tool storage and a variety of other applications 
we also manufacture stainless steel exhaust systems  gauges and throttle controls for the performance boat industry through our marine components segment 
the economic slow down that had negatively affected our results became even more severe in  resulting in a decrease in sales from in response  we quickly reduced costs to the extent possible while continuing to focus on gaining new customers  expanding into new markets and enhancing the product offerings in each of our segments 
operating income overview we reported an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in and million in our results include a million goodwill impairment charge related to our marine components unit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment charge had no impact on our liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  or debt covenant compliance  and does not have any impact on future operations 
in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we have disclosed below our operating income  excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  which is a non gaap measure that is used by our management to assess the performance of our operations 
we believe the disclosure of operating income  exclusive of the goodwill impairment charge  provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to analyze the performance of our operations in the same way that our management assesses performance 
year ended december  dollars in thousands operating income gaap goodwill impairment charge operating income excluding goodwill impairment charge non gaap we reported an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in  excluding the goodwill impairment charge 
the change in operating income is primarily due to the negative effects of lower order rates from our customers as a result of unfavorable economic conditions in north america  reduced coverage of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs from the resulting under utilization of production capacity  legal expense associated with certain patent related litigation  and a write down on assets held for sale 
these items were partially offset by the positive effects of cost reductions implemented in response to lower sales 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  our operating income was million in compared to million in  although operating income was impacted by million in facility consolidation costs 
the change in operating income compared to  excluding the goodwill impairment charge  was primarily the net result of lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions in north america and increased raw material costs  offset by the favorable comparative impact of facility consolidation costs incurred in  the continuation of cost reductions throughout and a million favorable comparative impact in foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
results of operations compared to and compared to years ended december  change dollars in millions net sales cost of goods sold gross margin operating costs and expenses goodwill impairment nm nm legal expenses nm asset held for sale write down nm operating income loss percent of net sales cost of goods sold gross margin operating costs and expenses goodwill impairment legal expenses asset held for sale write down operating income loss nm not meaningful net sales 
net sales decreased approximately million in as compared to principally due to lower order rates from our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america 
our furniture components  security products and marine components segments accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the total decrease in sales year over year 
furniture components sales was a greater percentage of the total decrease due to furniture components greater reliance on sales to a small number of original equipment manufacturers in a few markets such as office furniture  tool storage and appliances that were more severely impacted by the economic slow down compared to the greater diversification of security products customers and markets which more closely matched the overall decline in the economy 
the marine segment accounted for a smaller percentage of the total decrease due to the smaller sales volume associated with that segment 
net sales decreased in as compared to principally due to lower order rates from many of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america  offset in part by the effect of sales price increases for certain products to mitigate the effect of higher raw material costs 
our furniture components  marine components  and security products segments accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the total decrease in sales year over year 
costs of goods sold and gross margin 
cost of goods sold decreased from to primarily due to decreased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased in from the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to reduced coverage of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs from lower sales volume and the related under utilization of capacity  partially offset by a net million in fixed manufacturing cost reductions implemented in response to lower sales 
cost of goods sold decreased from to primarily due to decreased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased slightly in from the prior year 
the slight decrease in gross margin percentage was due to the net impact of a number of factors including lower facility utilization rates relating to the decrease in sales  lower depreciation expense resulting from lower capital requirements relating to lower sales and minor increases in variable production costs not fully offset by price increases 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales and administrative costs relating to business unit and corporate management activities 
while operating cost and expenses were reduced by million from to in response to lower sales  it increased as a percentage of net sales due to the significant reduction in sales volumes 
as a percentage of net sales  operating costs and expenses decreased from to primarily as a result of million of costs recorded in related to the consolidation of three of our northern illinois facilities into one facility see note to the consolidated financial statements and a million favorable change in currency gains and losses 
goodwill impairment 
in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for our marine components reporting unit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
legal expenses 
in  we recorded million of patent litigation expenses relating to furniture components 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
assets held for sale write down 
in  we recorded a write down on assets held for sale of  relating to certain facilities held for sale that are no longer in use 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge discussed above  the comparison of operating income for to was primarily impacted by a negative impact of approximately million relating to lower order rates from many of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america  approximately million of patent litigation expenses relating to furniture components  and a write down on assets held for sale of approximately  the above decreases were primarily offset by a million reduction in fixed manufacturing expenses excluding depreciation in response to the lower sales volume  a million reduction in lower operating costs and expenses in response to the lower sales volume  and  in lower depreciation expense in due to a reduction in capital expenditures for shorter lived assets over the last several years in response to lower sales 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  the comparison of operating income for to was primarily impacted by a negative impact of approximately million relating to lower order rates from many of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america  and increased raw material costs that we were not able to fully recover through sales price increases by approximately million due to the competitive nature of the markets we serve 
the above decreases were primarily offset by the one time million of facility consolidation costs incurred in million in lower depreciation expense in due to a reduction in capital expenditures for shorter lived assets over the last several years in response to lower sales  and the million favorable effect on operating income of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
currency 
our furniture components segment has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
the majority of sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar with the remainder denominated in other currencies  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for our non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
in addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time  our non us operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non local currency sales or operating costs are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non local currency 
overall  fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our furniture component segment s net sales and operating income impact of changes in currency exchange rates vs in thousands transaction gains losses translation gain loss impact of rate total currency impact change changes vs impact on net sales operating income impact of changes in currency exchange rates vs in thousands transaction gains losses translation gain loss impact of rate total currency impact change changes vs impact on net sales operating income the net impact on operations of changes in currency rates from to was not significant 
the positive impact on operating income for the versus comparison is due to transactional currency exchange gains in as compared to losses in which were a function of the timing of currency exchange rate changes and the settlement of non local currency receivables and payables 
general our profitability primarily depends on our ability to utilize our production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for our products and our ability to control our manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and materials 
the materials used in our products consist of purchased components and raw materials some of which are subject to fluctuations in the commodity markets such as zinc  copper  plastic resin  coiled steel and stainless steel 
total material costs represent approximately of our cost of sales in  with commodity related raw materials accounting for approximately of our cost of sales 
during and most of  worldwide raw material costs increased significantly and then declined in we occasionally enter into commodity related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in commodity related raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize commodity related raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
we enter into such arrangements for zinc and coiled steel 
while commodity related raw material purchase prices stabilized to a certain extent in  it is uncertain whether the current prices will remain near the current levels during materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by raw material cost pressures 
other non operating income  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other non operating income  net primarily includes interest income 
interest income decreased approximately  in compared to and decreased  in compared to due to lower interest rates on lower invested cash balances 
interest expense interest expense decreased approximately million in compared to as the result of a lower interest rate on the outstanding principal amount of our note payable to affiliate at december  as compared to at december  
interest expense increased approximately million in compared to as a result of financing the october repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock from an affiliate with a promissory note 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect interest expense to be comparable to provision for income taxes as a member of the contran tax group  we compute our provision for income taxes on a separate company basis  using the tax elections made by contran 
one such election is whether to claim a deduction or a tax credit against us taxable income with respect to foreign income taxes paid 
consistent with elections of the contran tax group  in the last three years we did not claim a credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid but instead we claimed a tax deduction for related withholding taxes 
this resulted in an increase in our effective income tax rate 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  our effective income tax rate increased from in to in and increased from in to in the increases in our effective income tax rates over the three year period are primarily due to a higher percentage of our results being sourced from canada and as noted above  the taxes on these results are not claimed as a credit on our us tax return 
we currently expect our effective income tax rate for will be lower than our effective rate for segment results the key performance indicator for our segments is the level of their operating income see discussion below

security products net sales decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease in sales is primarily due to lower customer order rates from most of our customers resulting from unfavorable economic conditions in north america 
gross margin percentage increased slightly less than in compared to and operating income percentage was comparable at for the same periods 
the comparable gross margin and operating income percentages were achieved despite the significant decrease in sales due to the positive impact of i a million reduction in fixed manufacturing costs implemented in response to lower sales  ii a million improvement in variable contribution margin through a combination of sales price increases implemented at the beginning of in response to cost increases experienced in and a more favorable product mix and iii a  reduction in selling  general and administrative costs in response to lower sales which were partially offset by reduced fixed costs coverage from lower sales and the related under utilization of capacity

gross margin decreased to a loss in as compared to the operating loss for the marine components segment includes a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  our operating loss increased approximately million in as compared to the decrease in gross margin and increase in operating loss are the result of reduced coverage of fixed costs from lower sales volume  partially offset by reduced fixed manufacturing costs of approximately  and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately  in response to lower sales

gross margin percentage decreased from in to in excluding the goodwill impairment charge discussed above  operating income decreased from approximately  of income in to an operating loss of approximately  in the decreases in gross margin and operating income are the result of reduced coverage of fixed costs from lower sales volume 
outlook demand for our components continues to be slow and unstable as customers react to the condition of the overall economy 
while changes in market demand are not within our control  we are focused on the areas we can impact 
staffing levels are continuously being evaluated in relation to sales order rates resulting in headcount adjustments  to the extent possible  to match staffing levels with demand 
we expect our lean manufacturing and cost improvement initiatives to continue to positively impact our productivity and result in a more efficient infrastructure that we can leverage when demand growth returns 
additionally  we continue to seek opportunities to gain market share in markets we currently serve  expand into new markets and develop new product features in order to mitigate the impact of reduced demand as well as broaden our sales base 
in addition to challenges with overall demand  volatility in the cost of our commodity related raw materials is ongoing 
we currently expect these costs to be volatile for we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  a competitor has filed claims against us for patent infringement 
we have denied the allegations of patent infringement and are seeking to have the claims dismissed 
while we currently believe the disposition of these claims should not have a material  long term adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  we expect to continue to incur costs defending against such claims during the short term that are likely to be material 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a third amendment to our million credit agreement the third amendment 
the primary purpose of the third amendment was to adjust certain covenants in the credit agreement in order to take into consideration our current and expected future financial performance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the adjustments to the covenants will allow us to comply with the covenant restrictions through the maturity of the facility in january  however  if future operating results differ materially from our expectations we may be unable to maintain compliance 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the facility 
we are currently in compliance with all covenant restrictions under the credit agreement 
maintaining compliance with certain of the covenant restrictions is dependent upon our current financial performance as measured at the end of each quarter 
one of the financial performance covenants requires earnings before interest and taxes for the trailing four quarters not including quarters prior to september to be times cash interest expense 
since our earnings before interest and taxes was a loss of  and million for the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  as measured under the terms of the credit agreement  effectively we could not have had any borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement during these periods of without violating the covenant as any cash interest expense incurred would have exceeded the required to ratio 
in the future  to the extent we do not generate the required amount of earnings before interest and taxes  as measured under the credit agreement  we would similarly be unable to borrow on the credit agreement without violating this financial performance covenant 
however  there are no current expectations that we will be required to borrow on the revolving credit facility in the near term as cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to fund our future liquidity requirements 
as a condition to the third amendment  in the third quarter of we executed with timet finance management company  a subsidiary of titanium metals corporation and an affiliate of ours tfmc  an amended and restated subordinated term loan promissory note payable to the order of tfmc 
the material changes effected by the amended and restated tfmc note were the deferral of required principal and interest payments on the note until on or after january  and certain restrictions on the amount of payments that could be made after that date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
our primary source of liquidity on an on going basis is our cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital  capital expenditures or reducing our outstanding stock and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  we will incur indebtedness  primarily for short term working capital needs  or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
in addition  from time to time  we may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
consolidated cash flows 
operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for the last three years have generally been similar to the trends in our earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to  and in compared to due to the timing of capital expenditures placed into service each year 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the cash provided by operating activities in was comparable to despite the significant decrease in operating results excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment 
comparable cash provided by operating activities in as compared to is primarily the net result of lower operating results in of approximately million exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge in and the  asset held for sale write down in  higher net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and non tax related accruals of million in lower cash paid for income taxes in of million due to lower earnings in  lower depreciation and amortization in of million  lower cash paid for interest in of million due to lower interest rates  and higher adjustments to the provision for inventory reserves in of approximately  due to an increase in obsolete inventory resulting from reduced demand 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  an increase of million over cash provided by operating activities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily the net result of higher operating income in of approximately  exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  lower depreciation and amortization in of million  higher net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and non tax related accruals of million in lower cash paid for income taxes in of million due to lower repatriations of non us earnings in  higher cash paid for interest in of million due to the october issuance of our promissory note to an affiliate  and lower interest income of approximately  in due to lower average cash balances during resulting from the use of excess cash to prepay principle on our promissory note payable to an affiliate 
relative changes in working capital can have a significant effect on cash flows from operating activities 
as shown below  our average days sales outstanding decreased from december  to december  across all segments 
in absolute terms  we reduced accounts receivable by million in as compared to the reduction in our average days sales outstanding was the result of our efforts to increase our accounts receivable collection efforts in order to reduce our exposure to bad debts in light of the challenging economic environment

the overall decrease in days in inventory was the result of our focus on inventory management controls in order to ensure our inventory balances are aligned with the current needs of our business in light of the reduction in customer demand 
the variability in days in inventory among our segments primarily relates to the complexity of the production processes and therefore the length of time it takes to produce end products

capital expenditures in the past three years have primarily emphasized improving our manufacturing facilities and investing in manufacturing equipment which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
during  we constructed a new facility and consolidated three of our northern illinois facilities into one facility at a cost of approximately million 
as a part of the facility consolidation project  the lake bluff  illinois facility was sold in for approximately million which approximated book value 
the river grove  illinois facility is no longer being utilized and is being actively marketed for sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in april of and we collected payments of million  respectively  related to the sale of our european thomas regout operations  completed in  which required annual payments over a period of four years 
in april of  we received our final payment totaling approximately  of which  related to principal and the remaining  related to interest that had accrued over the four year period 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million compared to capital expenditures of million in and million in our planned capital expenditures in were limited to expenditures required to meet expected customer demand and properly maintain our facilities 
capital spending for is expected to be funded through cash on hand and cash generated from operations and relates to expenditures required to meet expected customer demand and properly maintain our facilities 
in february  we entered into an unsecured demand promissory note with nl whereby we agreed to loan nl up to million 
our loans to nl will bear interest at the prime rate less  with all principal due on demand on or after march  and in any event no later than december   with interest payable quarterly 
the amount of our outstanding loans to nl at any time is at our discretion 
it is probable during that we will loan amounts to nl in addition to the million available under the promissory note 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
cash dividends paid totaled million in and million 
per share in each of and dividends paid decreased in as a result of the repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock held by tfmc  an affiliate in the fourth quarter of we purchased these shares for per share  or aggregate consideration of million  which we paid in the form of a consolidated promissory note 
the price per share was determined based on open market transactions of our class a common stock around the time the repurchase from tfmc was approved 
we prepaid approximately million and million toward the promissory note in and  respectively 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we repurchased approximately  shares of our class a common stock in market transactions for an aggregate of million 
in  we also repurchased approximately  shares of our class a common stock in market transactions for an aggregate of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility that matures in january and there are no current expectations to borrow on the revolving credit facility in the near term 
as a result of covenant restrictions relating to the ratio of earnings before interest and tax to cash interest expense  as defined in the credit agreement  we would not have been able to borrow under the credit agreement during the third or fourth quarters of due to a loss before interest and tax incurred in each of those quarters  respectively 
any future losses before interest and tax would also likely restrict or prohibit borrowings under the credit agreement 
however  there are no current expectations that we will be required to borrow on the revolving credit facility in the near term as cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to fund our future liquidity requirements 
see outlook for further discussion of expectations relating to compliance with credit facility debt covenants 
while the required ratio of earnings before interest and tax to cash interest expense prohibited our ability to borrow under the credit agreement during the third and fourth quarters of  the financial covenant does not directly impact our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
we believe cash generated from operations together with cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent that actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
provisions contained in our revolving credit facility could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  our revolving credit facility allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of our revolving credit facility could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
although there are no current expectations to borrow on the revolving credit facility  lower future operating results would likely reduce or eliminate our amount available to borrow and restrict future dividends 
see outlook for further discussion of expectations relating to compliance with credit facility debt covenants 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other we believe that cash generated from operations together with cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared 
to the extent that our actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing our indebtedness or that of our subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payments due by period total and after in thousands note and interest payable to affiliate operating leases purchase obligations income taxes fixed asset acquisitions total contractual cash obligations the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to long term debt  operating leases and fixed asset acquisitions are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the timing and amount shown for purchase obligations  which consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations primarily commitments to purchase raw materials is also based on the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the amount shown for income taxes is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects 
commitments and contingencies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our actual future results might differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of our operating segments inventory reserves we provide reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we also consider the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  we may be required to recognize additional inventory reserves 
goodwill our goodwill totaled million at december  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually in the third quarter of each year 
goodwill is also evaluated for impairment at other times whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the estimated fair values of our three reporting units are determined using level inputs of a discounted cash flow technique since level inputs of market prices are not available at the reporting unit level 
we also consider control premiums when assessing fair value of our segments 
if the fair value is less than the book value  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
however  different assumptions and estimates could result in materially different findings which could result in the recognition of a material goodwill impairment 
during  we evaluated our furniture components reporting unit for goodwill impairment at each of the first  second and third quarter interim dates 
we tested this reporting unit for impairment because  while continuing to generate positive operating cash flows  it reported sales and operating income significantly below our expectations as a result of the severe contraction in demand in the office furniture and appliance markets 
at each of these impairment review dates in  we concluded no impairments were present 
however  if our future cash flows from operations less capital expenditures for this reporting unit were to be significantly below our current expectations approximately below our current expectations  it is reasonably likely that we would conclude an impairment of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit would be present under asc topic  goodwill 
per our annual impairment review during the third quarter  the estimated fair value of our furniture components reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
the carrying value included approximately million of goodwill 
holding all other assumptions constant at the re evaluation date  an increase in the rate used to discount our expected cash flows of approximately basis points would reduce the enterprise value for our furniture components unit sufficiently to indicate a potential impairment 
during the third quarter of  we determined that all of the goodwill associated with our marine components reporting unit was impaired 
as a result  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million for our marine components reporting unit  which represented all of the goodwill we had previously recognized for this reporting unit 
the factors that led us to conclude goodwill associated with the marine components reporting unit was fully impaired include the continued decline in consumer spending in the marine market as well as the overall negative economic outlook  both of which resulted in near term and longer term reduced revenue  profit and cash flow forecasts for the marine components unit 
while we continue to believe in the long term potential of the marine components unit  due to the extraordinary economic downturn in the boating industry we are not currently able to foresee when the industry and our business will recover 
in response to the present economic conditions  we have taken steps to reduce operating costs without inhibiting our ability to take advantage of opportunities to expand our market share 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the third quarter of for our security products reporting unit and concluded there was no impairment of the goodwill for this reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of our security products reporting unit was substantially in excess of their respective carrying value 
long lived assets we account for our long lived assets in accordance with applicable gaap 
we assess property and equipment for impairment only when circumstances as specified in asc  property  plant  and equipment indicate an impairment may exist 
due to the continued decline in the marine industry and lower than expected results of our custom marine and livorsi marine operations comprising our marine components reporting unit  we evaluated the long lived assets for our marine components reporting unit in the third quarter of and concluded no impairments were present 
however  if our future cash flows from operations less capital expenditures were to drop significantly below our current expectations approximately for custom marine and for livorsi marine  it is reasonably likely we would conclude an impairment was present 
at december  the asset carrying values of custom marine and livorsi marine were million and million  respectively 
no other long lived assets in our other reporting units were tested for impairment during because there were no circumstances to indicate impairment may exist at these units 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting in accordance with applicable gaap for accounting for income taxes 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate was made 
we also evaluate at the end of each reporting period whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of the undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of the undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
if our prior conclusions change  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of the previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to us in the us we did not change our conclusions on our undistributed foreign earnings in beginning in  we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the then new provisions of asc topic  income taxes  for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
from time to time  tax authorities will examine certain of our income tax returns 
tax authorities may interpret tax regulations differently than we do 
judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for uncertain tax positions and therefore a decrease or increase in our reported net income in the period of such change 
accruals we record accruals for environmental  legal and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with the contingencies become probable  and we can reasonably estimate the amounts of the future expenditures 
however  new information may become available to us  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for such matters and  therefore  a corresponding decrease or increase of our reported net income in the period of such change 
at december  we have accrued legal costs of approximately million 
assets held for sale our assets held for sale at december   consist of a facility in river grove  illinois and a facility in neenah  wisconsin 
these two properties primarily land  buildings and building improvements were formerly used in our operations 
discussions with potential buyers of both properties had been active through the first quarter of subsequently during the second quarter of  and as weak economic conditions continued longer than expected  we concluded that it was unlikely we would sell these properties at or above their previous carrying values in the near term and therefore an adjustment to their carrying values was appropriate 
in determining the estimated fair values of the properties  we considered recent sales prices for other properties near the facilities  which prices are level inputs as defined by asc accordingly  during the second quarter of  we recorded a write down of approximately  to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their aggregate estimated fair value less cost to sell of million 
this charge is included in corporate operating expense 
both properties are being actively marketed 
however  due to the current state of the commercial real estate market  we can not be certain of the timing of the disposition of the assets 
if we continue to experience difficulty in disposing of the assets at or above their carrying value  we may have to record additional write downs of the assets in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under our secured revolving bank credit agreement 
in conjunction with the repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock  during the fourth quarter of  we issued a promissory note for million 
at december   there was million of principle outstanding on the promissory note million at december  which bears interest at libor plus  and at december  and  respectively and the fair value of such indebtedness approximates its carrying value 
the interest rate is reset quarterly based on the three month libor 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the amended and restated subordinated term loan promissory note payable to the order of tfmc 
currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products outside the united states principally canada and taiwan 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most materials  labor and other production costs for these non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
as a result  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
as previously noted certain of our sales generated by our canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  we periodically enter into forward currency contracts to mitigate the financial statement impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding forward currency contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently unless the contract is designated as a hedge upon which the mark to market adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
we had no forward currency contracts outstanding at december  at december  we had entered into a series of short term forward currency exchange contracts to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates of cdn 
to per us dollar 
these contracts qualified for hedge accounting and matured through june at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such contracts was not material at december  raw materials 
we will occasionally enter into raw material arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
otherwise  we generally do not have long term supply agreements for our raw material requirements because either we believe the risk of unavailability of those raw materials is low and we believe the price to be stable or because long term supply agreements for those materials are generally not available 
we do not engage in commodity hedging programs 
other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assumes hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be our projections of future events  gains or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
