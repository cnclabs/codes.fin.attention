item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  the company identified certain non agency rmbs securities trading in inactive markets 
during the three months ended december   the change in fair value for the identified rmbs securities resulted in a million increase in net unrealized loss on 
table of contents investments 
this increase in net unrealized losses on investments resulted in a million decrease in shareholders equity as at december  goodwill and intangible assets the company has performed an impairment analysis of its carried goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as required by us gaap 
the analysis included a comparison of the company s market capitalization to book value ratio 
management has also evaluated the fair value of talbot relative to its book value on the following basis gross premium written for and  internal demand for and valuation of syndicate capacity  and utilization of lloyd s licenses  and external demand for syndicate capacity 
reporting units are consistent with the segmental basis 
based on its analysis  management has concluded that an impairment valuation is not required against the carried goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
cash flows during the three months ended december  and  the company generated net cash from operating activities of million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december  and  the company generated net cash from operating activities of million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operations generally represent premiums collected  investment earnings realized and investment gains realized less losses and loss expenses paid and underwriting and other expenses paid 
cash flows from operations may differ substantially  however  from net income 
pursuant to an amalgamation agreement dated july  among ipc  validus holdings  ltd 
and validus  ltd  on september   the company acquired all of ipc s outstanding common shares in exchange for a combination of the company s common shares and cash the ipc acquisition 
each outstanding ipc common share including any shares held by ipc shareholders that did not vote in favor of the amalgamation  but excluding shares owned by the company  have been cancelled and converted into the right to receive of the company s common shares  in cash less any applicable withholding tax and without interest and cash in lieu of fractional shares 
the ipc acquisition resulted in the issuance by the company of  common shares valued at per share and the payment of million in cash to ipc shareholders 
ipc s operations are focused on short tail lines of reinsurance 
the primary lines in which ipc conducted business were property catastrophe reinsurance and  to a limited extent  property per risk excess  aviation including satellite and other short tail reinsurance on a worldwide basis 
the acquisition of ipc was undertaken to gain a strategic advantage in the current reinsurance market and increase the company s capital base 
sources of funds consist primarily of the receipt of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
in addition  cash will also be received from financing activities 
cash is used to pay primarily losses and loss expenses  brokerage commissions  excise taxes  general and administrative expenses  purchase new investments  payment of premiums retroceded and payment of dividends 
the company has had sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements 
as of december  and december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
the company has written certain business that has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity 
this results in volatility in both results and operational cash flows 
the potential for large claims or a series of claims under one or more reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may be required within relatively short periods of time 
as a result  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
management believes the company s unused credit facility amounts and highly liquid investment portfolio are sufficient to support any potential operating cash flow deficiencies 
please refer to the table detailing the company s borrowings and credit facilities as at december   presented above 

table of contents in addition to relying on premiums received and investment income from the investment portfolio  the company intends to meet these cash flow demands by carrying a substantial amount of short and medium term investments that would mature  or possibly be sold  prior to the settlement of expected liabilities 
the company cannot provide assurance  however  that it will successfully match the structure of its investments with its liabilities due to uncertainty related to the timing and severity of loss events

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe we are principally exposed to five types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk  liquidity risk  and effects of inflation 

table of contents interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio falls and the company has the risk that cash outflows will have to be funded by selling assets  which will be trading at depreciated values 
as interest rates decline  the market value of the company s fixed income portfolio increases and the company has reinvestment risk  as funds reinvested will earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of the insurance and reinsurance liabilities the company assumes 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity and short term investments from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates based on us treasury yield would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of  or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity and short term investments from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of  or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as at december   the company held million december  million  or december   of the company s fixed maturity portfolio in asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of underlying loans increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
the adverse impact of prepayment is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
as a result  the company will be exposed to reinvestment risk  as cash flows received by the company will be accelerated and will be reinvested at the prevailing interest rates 
foreign currency risk certain of the company s reinsurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss 
foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that there is an increase in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which losses are ultimately owed 
therefore  we attempt to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total assets and million  or of our total liabilities was held in foreign currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total liabilities held in foreign currencies was non monetary items which do not require revaluation at each reporting date 
as of december   million  or of our total assets and million  or of our total liabilities was held in foreign currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total liabilities held in foreign currencies was non monetary items which do not require revaluation at each reporting date 
the company does not transact in foreign exchange markets to hedge its foreign currency exposure 
to the extent foreign currency exposure is not hedged  the company may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to us 
we attempt to limit our credit exposure by purchasing high quality fixed income investments to maintain an average portfolio credit quality of aa or higher with mortgage and commercial mortgage backed issues having an aggregate weighted average credit quality of aaa 
in addition  we have limited our exposure to any single issuer to or less of total investments  excluding treasury and agency securities 
the minimum credit rating of any security purchased is a a and where investments are downgraded below a a  we permit our investment managers to hold up to in aggregate market value  or up to with written authorization of the company 
at december   of the portfolio was below a a and we did not have an aggregate exposure to any single issuer of more than of total investments  other than with respect to government securities 

table of contents the amount of the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of the company s financial assets 
the company s primary credit risks reside in investment in us corporate bonds and recoverables from reinsurers at the talbot segment 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk arising from its exposure to individual reinsurers 
the reinsurance program is generally placed with reinsurers whose rating  at the time of placement  was a or better rated by s p or the equivalent with other rating agencies 
exposure to a single reinsurer is also controlled with restrictions dependent on rating 
at december   of reinsurance recoverables which includes loss reserves recoverable and recoverables on paid losses were from reinsurers rated a  december  rated a or better or from reinsurers posting full collateral 
validus re does not have any reinsurance recoverable balances that are not fully collateralized 
liquidity risk certain of the company s investments may become illiquid 
the current disruption in the credit markets may materially affect the liquidity of the company s investments  including residential mortgage backed securities which at december  represent december  of total cash and investments 
if the company requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements which could include claims on a major catastrophic event in a period of market illiquidity  the investments may be difficult to sell in a timely manner and may have to be disposed of for less than what may otherwise have been possible under other conditions 
at december   the company had  million of unrestricted  liquid assets  defined as unpledged cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  government and government agency securities 
details of the company s debt and financing arrangements at december  are provided below 
on september   as part of the acquisition of ipc the company assumed ipc s investment portfolio containing  million of corporate bonds  million of agency residential mortgage backed securities  million of equity mutual funds  million fund of hedge funds and million of equity mutual funds contained within a deferred compensation trust 
on september   the company realized a gain of million on the disposition of million of equity mutual funds 
a redemption request for the fund of hedge funds was submitted for value as at october  the redemption amounted to million 
as of december  the company had received million and accordingly  a receivable exists for the remaining million 
subsequent to year end  an additional million was received  leaving million receivable with ultimate collection expected upon the funds audit completion deadline of june  as of december   the company held a fund of hedge fund side pocket of million 
while a redemption request has been submitted  the timing of receipt of proceeds on the side pocket is indeterminable 
during the fourth quarter  the company received distribution proceeds of million from the side pocket 
subsequent to year end  an additional million was received from the side pocket
