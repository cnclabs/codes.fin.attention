during the year ended december   we recorded positive changes in prior period accounting estimates to reduce contractual allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts  which increased our revenues by  and decreased general and administrative expenses by  respectively 
these positive changes in accounting estimates were the result of continued improvements to our collection processes  as well as favorable experience in the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable for services rendered in prior periods and changes in reimbursement policies by certain payors 
see note  revenue recognition  and allowance for doubtful accounts  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to the income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million 
as of december   we had million in net deferred tax assets that were offset entirely by a valuation allowance  as we were unable to conclude  at that time  that it was more likely than not that such deferred tax assets would be realized 
in  although realization was not assured  we believed it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets through the ordinary course of business and expected future taxable income 
therefore  during the year ended december   we recorded a million tax benefit representing the release of the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was reduced by the usage of net operating losses and other credits  resulting primarily in alternative minimum taxes 
during the years ended december  and  there were no tax liabilities due to net losses during each period 
there is a lack of comparability in the basic and diluted net income loss per share amounts between the periods presented herein prior to and any future periods 
see note in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the pro forma basic and diluted net income loss per share calculations 
for the year ended december   million of our net income of million was allocated to preferred stockholders for purposes of calculating net income per share pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock  resulting in million of net income allocable to common stockholders 
see note in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for an explanation of the method and amounts used in the computation of the per share amounts 
in november  our preferred stock converted into million shares of our common stock upon completion of our initial public offering  or ipo 
prior to our ipo  net income loss per share was computed as required by asc topic  earnings per share  which established standards regarding the computation of earnings per share  or eps  by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in our dividends and earnings 
asc topic requires earnings for the period  after deduction of preferred stock dividends  to be allocated between the common and preferred stockholders based on their respective rights to receive dividends  whether or not declared 
basic net income loss per share is then calculated by dividing income allocable to common stockholders after the reduction for any preferred stock dividends assuming current income for the period had been distributed by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding  net of shares subject to repurchase by us 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
any future determination related to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors 
furthermore  to the extent we incur additional indebtedness in the future  the loan documents governing such indebtedness may restrict our ability to pay dividends 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a specialized laboratory service provider focused on delivering personalized and comprehensive diagnostic services to community based hem oncs 
our highly trained group of hempaths utilizes sophisticated diagnostic technologies to provide a differentiated  specialized and integrated assessment of a patient s condition  aiding physicians in making vital decisions concerning the treatment of malignancies of the blood and bone marrow  and other forms of cancer 
we were organized in  and we began offering specialized diagnostic services in the third quarter of our key service offerings include compass and chart 
by ordering our compass service offering  the hem onc authorizes our hempath to determine the appropriate diagnostic tests to be performed  and our hempath then integrates patient history and previous and current test results into a comprehensive diagnostic report 
as part of our chart service offering  the hem onc also receives a detailed assessment of a patient s disease progression over time 
test requisitions for more than half of the patient samples we processed for the years ended december   and  included our compass or chart service offerings 
we estimate that the us bone marrow testing market alone represents approximately a billion opportunity annually and that our current market share for bone marrow procedures is approximately 
our objective is to continue to increase our market share  revenues and profits at a rate significantly faster than the overall growth rate market for blood and bone marrow testing services by continuing to provide and expand our high quality  community based hem onc focused specialized diagnostic services 
in furtherance of this objective  our growth strategy has the following key elements expand our organization and infrastructure by increasing our personnel  particularly in sales  to enable us to visit more hem oncs on a more frequent basis and  in time  to expand into new markets  hiring and retaining cartesian hempaths and additional laboratory resources to continue to provide high quality  specialized diagnostic services  expand service offerings to hem oncs by being first to market with new technologies and innovations  leverage our existing infrastructure to increase operating efficiencies by taking advantage of economies of scale and volume discounts  where possible  and pursue additional collaborations and acquisitions to supplement our business 
as a specialized diagnostic service provider  we rely extensively on our high quality of service to promote and maintain our relationships with our community based hem oncs 
we compete primarily based on the quality of testing  reporting and information systems  reliability in patient sample transport  reputation in the medical community and access to our highly qualified hempaths 
our primary competitors include hospital pathologists  esoteric testing laboratories  national reference laboratories and academic laboratories 
our revenues consist primarily of payments or reimbursements received from governmental payors  such as medicare and medicaid  private insurers  including managed care organizations  and private payors  such as hospitals  patients  and others for the specialized diagnostic services rendered to our hem onc customers 
our revenues are affected by changes in customer and case volume  case complexity  specimen type  payor mix  contractual allowances and reimbursement rates 

table of contents additionally  billing for diagnostic services is highly complex 
depending on our billing arrangement with each third party payor and applicable law  we are often obligated to bill in the specific manner prescribed by the various payors  each of which may have different billing requirements 
billing for diagnostic services in connection with governmental payor programs is subject to numerous federal and state regulations and other requirements  resulting in additional costs to us 
we report revenues from contracted payors  including medicare  certain insurance companies and certain healthcare institutions  based on the contractual rate  or in the case of medicare  the published fee schedules 
we report revenues from non contracted payors  including certain insurance companies and individuals  based on the amount expected to be collected 
we estimate amounts to be collected based on our historical collection experience 
we believe the key challenges in being able to continue to increase our market share  revenues and profits are our ability to continue to hire and retain qualified field sales representatives  key management and other personnel  cartesian s ability to hire and retain hempaths  changes in reimbursement levels for our specialized diagnostic services  changes in regulations  payor policies and contracting arrangements with payors  increased competition from competitors attempting to replicate our key service offerings or provide other services that compete with ours  our ability to scale our internal infrastructure  our ability to maintain and strengthen our relationships with our hem onc customers and our ability to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  and reporting systems and procedures 
to address these challenges  our management is focused upon expanding our sales organization as the primary driver for our continued growth while maintaining our existing hem onc customer relationships 
our management tracks and measures the general buying patterns of our hem onc customers including cases per month  revenues and cost of revenues per case and turn around time per case and is focused on adding additional sales management and sales representatives in key markets to enhance our penetration in those markets 
our management is also engaged in ensuring cartesian is focused on recruiting  hiring and retaining hempaths to provide the professional services component to support continued growth 
management measures the levels and timeliness of reimbursement from third party payors and reviews on a monthly basis the levels of receivables and average time for collections  as well as cost and margin trends to ensure that investments in our infrastructure and personnel are in line with current sales levels 
we intend to opportunistically pursue additional collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and acquisitions or in licensing of businesses  products or technologies that will enable us to accelerate the implementation of our strategic plan and to increase the number of hem onc customers we serve and or expand the services we provide to them  by way of investments in other companies  licensing of technology  co development arrangements  collaborations  asset purchases and other similar transactions 
for example  we currently provide specialized testing services and access to our hempaths through collaborations with select pharmaceutical companies 
we expect these collaborations to grow over time  which we believe will improve our financial performance and name recognition and reputation among hem oncs  and potentially provide us with early access to new technologies available for commercialization 
we expect annual revenues from these collaborations to remain at approximately of our total revenues in management has continued efforts to ensure that office and laboratory space is adequate to accommodate the necessary capacity requirements to meet our current and expanding business needs 
specifically  during the year ended december   we entered new leases for a new facility with an additional approximately  square feet of space located in carlsbad  california to be used for office and laboratory operations and an additional approximately  square feet of office space within our existing corporate headquarters to be used for administrative operations 
subsequent to the year ended december   we entered into a lease for a new facility with an additional approximately  square feet of office space in carlsbad  california  into which we will relocate and expand our customer service and other support functions 
additionally  we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire the  square foot facility for which we had previously entered into a lease agreement in see further discussion of these transactions within note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we initiated improvements on the newly purchased facility in the fourth quarter of we will 
table of contents initiate tenant improvements on the new  square foot customer service and support facility in the first quarter of we expect improvements on both facilities to be complete and the facilities to be operational in the second quarter of once complete  these new facility expansions will increase our laboratory and office space to approximately  square feet  increasing both cost of revenue and administrative expenses relating to incremental facilities costs 
for the year ended december   total capital expenditures were million 
we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately million for including approximately million of costs associated with our newly acquired laboratory and customer service and support facilities and approximately million for equipment  computers  furniture and the like  to support our growing operational needs 
we believe our recent expansion efforts will be adequate to meet our needs for we are not currently anticipating the need to expand into a new facility located in a geographically different region in  as previously contemplated 
our most significant developments increased revenues by to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  increased the number of cases processed by to approximately  for the year ended december   up from approximately  for the year ended december  increased income from operations to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december   despite our increased cost of sales  headcount and facility expense 
continued expansion efforts by adding approximately  square feet of space to be used for office and laboratory operations 
increased the number of cartesian hempaths by to as of december   up from as of december  increased the number of field sales representatives by to as of december   up from as of december  increased total headcount by to employees  including cartesian employees and part time employees  as of december   up from employees  including part time employees  as of december  increased the number of ordering doctors to approximately  for the year ended december   up from approximately  for the year ended december  consolidated financial statement presentation as of january   the date the psa with cartesian became effective  we determined we had a controlling financial interest in cartesian and began to consolidate the results of cartesian based on the criteria under financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  consolidations 
all intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation 
seasonality the majority of our testing volume is dependent on patient visits to hem oncs offices and other healthcare providers 
volume of testing generally declines during the vacation seasons  year end holiday periods and other major holidays  particularly when those holidays fall during the middle of the week 
in addition  volume of testing tends to decline due to adverse weather conditions  such as excessively hot or cold spells or hurricanes or tornados in certain regions  consequently reducing revenues and cash flows in any affected period 
therefore  comparison of the results of successive periods may not accurately reflect trends for future periods 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of investment securities  long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation expense 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the policies discussed below  see note in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues as required by asc topic  revenue recognition  when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our specialized diagnostic services are performed based on a written test requisition form and revenues are recognized once the diagnostic services have been performed  the results have been delivered to the ordering physician  the payor has been identified and eligibility and insurance have been verified 
these diagnostic services are billed to various payors  including medicare  commercial insurance companies  other directly billed healthcare institutions such as hospitals  and individuals 
we report revenues from contracted payors  including medicare  certain insurance companies and certain healthcare institutions  based on the contractual rate  or in the case of medicare  the published fee schedules 
we report revenues from non contracted payors  including certain insurance companies and individuals  based on the amount expected to be collected 
the difference between the amount billed and the amount expected to be collected from non contracted payors is recorded as a contractual allowance to arrive at net revenues 
the expected revenues from non contracted payors are based on the historical collection experience of each payor or payor group  as appropriate 
in each reporting period  we review our historical collection experience for non contracted payors and adjust our expected revenues for current and subsequent periods accordingly 
because a substantial portion of our revenues is from third party payors with whom we are not currently contracted  it is likely that we will be required to make positive or negative adjustments to accounting estimates with respect to contractual allowances in the future  which may positively or adversely affect our results of operations 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded positive changes in prior year accounting estimates to reduce contractual allowances  which increased our revenues by million  million and  respectively 
these favorable changes in accounting estimates related primarily to non contracted payors and resulted from continued improvements to our collection processes  changes in reimbursement policies by certain payors and increased hiring of personnel and management focused on the collection of accounts receivable for services rendered in prior periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts at the same time revenues are recognized  an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for estimated uncollectible amounts due from our contracted payors 
the process for estimating the collection of receivables associated with our specialized diagnostic services involves significant assumptions and judgments 
specifically  
table of contents the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted periodically  based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience with specific payors and other relevant factors 
the realization cycle for certain governmental and managed care payors can be lengthy  involving denial  appeal and adjudication processes  and are subject to periodic adjustments that may be significant 
provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expense 
accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible and deducted from our allowance for doubtful accounts after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted 
as of december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively  which we reduced by million and  respectively  for write offs  net of recoveries 
prior to writing off an account receivable and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements  we make reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect our accounts receivable  including deductible and coinsurance amounts  in a consistent manner for all payor classes 
we have established collection processes  which may include but are not limited to an automated process for identifying past due accounts  specific follow up activities at scheduled intervals  monitoring of collection activities  and forwarding significant past due accounts to collection agencies 
uncollectible account balances for all payor classes are generally written off after remaining unpaid for a period of months 
occasionally  balances may be determined to be uncollectible prior to the passage of months from the last billing date and are written off at the time of such determination 
our allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for at a rate of approximately and of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following tables present a summary of our outstanding accounts receivable balances december  days total in thousands commerical payors medicare medicaid self pay other total accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net december  days total in thousands commerical payors medicare medicaid self pay other total accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net we continually strive to improve our billing and collection systems and processes  which includes increasing the number of trained personnel dedicated to this effort 
to assess our efforts  we continually monitor the dso of our accounts receivable 
our dso averaged days in  which was consistent with days in as of december  and  our dso was days and days  respectively 
the increase in our 
table of contents dso as of december   pertains primarily to the timing of payments relating to certain contracted payors 
we expect to maintain our average dso levels into as we continue to pursue improvements to collection procedures and work with our payors to ensure timely processing of reimbursement payments 
income taxes asc topic  income taxes  establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertain tax positions 
asc topic clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
we have recognized no significant interest or penalties since the adoption of provisions within asc topic in we recognized no significant interest or penalties during the year ended december  as required by provisions within asc topic  income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
as of december  and  we no longer maintained a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  as we concluded it meets the more likely than not threshold required under asc topic due to the adoption of provisions within asc topic  compensation  we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we followed the with and without approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  credit carryforwards and certain deductions have been subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
under sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership have required us to limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that were previously available to offset future taxable income 
we have had three change in ownership events that limit the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
the change in ownership events occurred in march  december and march and resulted in annual net operating loss carryforward limitations of   and million  respectively 
as a result of a net unrealized built in gain from the march change in ownership  our net operating loss carryforward annual limitation of million was increased to million for each of the five years starting after the change in ownership 
additional limitations on the use of these tax attributes could occur in the event of possible disputes arising in examination from various taxing authorities 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense as required by asc topic we grant share based awards of stock options and rsus to employees  directors and cartesian doctors 
we adopted asc topic using the prospective approach  which applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 

table of contents in addition  we allow qualified employees  excluding directors and cartesian doctors  to participate in our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  which provides employees the opportunity to purchase our common stock at a discount 
generally  the espp consists of a two year offering period with four six month purchase periods and contains a look back provision for determining the purchase price 
we value and account for our espp as required by asc topic the objective of the measurement process for espps with a look back option is to reasonably measure the fair value of the award at the grant date  the date at which there is a mutual understanding of the terms of the award in exchange for the services already rendered and the employee s total contributions are known 
at this time  we become contingently obligated to issue equity instruments to the employee 
typically  the grant date is the first business day of each offering period 
employee contributions are generally made through payroll deductions 
we previously granted equity instruments issued to non employees  excluding cartesian employees and directors  and recorded expense at the fair value over the related service period as required by asc topic and periodically revalued the equity instruments as they vested 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized   and  respectively  of non employee stock based compensation 
we no longer grant these non employee equity awards 
all previously granted awards to these non employees were fully vested  and all remaining expense was recognized during the year ended december  we recognize stock based compensation expense for options and rsus over the vesting period using the straight line method 
the standard vesting period is four years for most stock option awards and three years for most rsu awards  but can range from one to four years in certain grants 
we measure stock options and rsu equity awards based on fair value 
in addition  we record stock based compensation expense related to the espp as required by asc topic the initial espp offering period extended from october  to june   with the first grant occurring in and continuing with new offerings each six months thereafter 
we classify stock based compensation expense amounts for all awards in the consolidated statements of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports 
we value rsu grants at their intrinsic value 
in contrast  we use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock options and espp awards using the following weighted average assumptions stock options espp years ended december  years ended december  grant date fair value per share assumptions used expected life of awards years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield forfeitures we calculated the weighted average expected life of options using the simplified method as prescribed by asc topic this decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited operating experience as a public company 
we derived the risk free interest rate assumption from the us treasury rates for us treasury zero coupon bonds with maturities equal to the expected term of the award being valued 
in addition  due to our limited historical data  the estimated volatility incorporates the historical volatility of comparable companies within our peer group with publicly available share prices 
we based the assumed dividend yield on its expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 

table of contents we recognize stock based compensation expense for options and rsus over the vesting period using the straight line method 
the standard vesting period is four years for most stock option awards and three years for most rsu awards  but can range from one to four years in certain grants 
we measure stock options and rsu equity awards based on fair value 
in addition  we record stock based compensation expense related to the espp as required by asc topic the initial espp offering period extended from october  to june   with the first grant occurring in and continuing with new offerings each six months thereafter 
we classify stock based compensation expense amounts for all awards in the consolidated statements of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports 
the following tables present a summary of our stock based compensation expense as recognized in the consolidated statements of operations year ended december  options rsus espp total in thousands cost of revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development year ended december  options rsus espp total in thousands cost of revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development year ended december  options rsus espp total in thousands cost of revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development we expect stock based compensation expense for to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues based on new and additional stock option and rsu grants offset by increasing revenues 
fair value the carrying value of certain of our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis  including cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities  are considered to be reasonable estimates of their respective fair values due to their short term nature 
we value financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as required under asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for 
table of contents measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the us and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
furthermore  asc topic  financial instruments  permits entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we have not specifically identified any financial instruments subject to measurement under asc topic as of december   we held a single ars with a cost basis of million 
we have evaluated this security based on interest rate spreads  credit quality  underlying assets of the issuer and underwriter  likelihood of a successful auction or redemption in the near term and the ability of the issuer to restructure the debt in the current credit environment 
we assumed that the issuer and underwriter would not be able to satisfy its debt obligation until the credit market would provide a debt restructuring opportunity within the next years and applied a liquidity discount 
the issuer of the ars continues to make interest payments as scheduled and has made two partial redemptions during the year ended december   of which we have benefited from one due to the lottery system used to distribute the redemption proceeds 
this redemption resulted in cash proceeds to us of  as a result of our internal valuation  we have recorded a temporary impairment of approximately million as of december  against a cost basis of million  as compared to a temporary impairment of million as of december  against a cost basis of million 
the unrealized loss  net of deferred tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
due to the uncertainty related to the timing of liquidity in the ars market in the near term  we classified this ars investment security as a long term asset on the balance sheet with a fair value of million as of december  and results of operations the following table presents a summary of the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income revenues revenues primarily consist of payments or reimbursements received from governmental payors  such as medicare and medicaid  private insurers  including managed care organizations  private payors  such as hospitals  patients and others for the specialized diagnostic services rendered to our hem onc customers 
substantially all of our revenues result from our having been assigned the right to bill and collect for the professional services provided by the hempaths employed by cartesian who work with us in our laboratory facility pursuant to our psa with cartesian 
our revenues from services not performed by cartesian were less than of our total revenues during each of the years ended december   and 
table of contents for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenues from private insurance  including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance providers  approximately from medicare and medicaid  and the remaining approximate from other sources 
for the years ended december  and  we derived approximately of our revenues from private insurance  including managed care organizations and other healthcare insurance providers  from medicare and medicaid  and the remaining from other sources 
our revenues are affected by changes in customer and case volume  payor mix  contractual allowances and reimbursement rates 
billing and reimbursement for our specialized diagnostic services in connection with governmental payor programs are subject to numerous federal and state regulations and other billing requirements 
reimbursement under medicare for our specialized diagnostic services is subject to a medicare physician fee schedule  and to a lesser degree  a clinical laboratory fee schedule  both of which are typically updated annually 
these billing and reimbursement arrangements are discussed more fully in the billing and reimbursement section contained in item of this annual report on form k 
years ended december  change revenues in thousands number of cases revenues per case during the years ended december   and  we recorded positive changes in prior period accounting estimates to reduce contractual allowances  which increased our revenues by million  million and  respectively 
these favorable changes in accounting estimates related primarily to non contracted payors and resulted from continued improvements to our collection processes  changes in reimbursement policies by certain payors and increased hiring of personnel and management focused on the collection of accounts receivable for services rendered in prior periods 
we intend to continue to seek opportunities to improve our billing and collections systems and processes  but these adjustments could fluctuate both favorably and unfavorably during future periods 
revenues increased to million for the year ended december  up from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively in each case inclusive of the changes in prior period accounting estimates noted above 
the increases of million  or  and million  or  for the years ended december  and  respectively  over each preceding year  were primarily due to case volume increases of and  respectively  and revenue per case increases of  or  and  or  respectively 
these increases were in part due to a net increase in and medicare reimbursement rates for our key service offerings and better than expected collections primarily on our non contracted business  as reflected by the favorable changes in accounting estimates that increased our revenues  as discussed above 
case volumes increased primarily as a result of the increase in the number of our field sales representatives from as of december  to as of december  similarly  the number of field sales representatives increased for the year ended december  over these increases in the number of our field sales representatives have enabled us to penetrate more accounts over a wider geographic area  increase our customer base and further focus our field sales representatives on in person customer visits 
sales force productivity during the years ended december  and also increased primarily as a result of enhanced recognition in the market  smaller geographies per sales representative  price increases  expanded service offerings and efficiencies realized from a more experienced sales force  which included expanding our sales management team to as of december   as compared to and as of december  and  respectively

gross profit as a percent of revenue increased to for the year ended december   as compared to and the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december  and of and  respectively  over each preceding year  resulted primarily from positive changes in prior period accounting estimates to reduce contractual allowances in each case inclusive of the changes in prior period accounting estimates noted above and increases in reimbursement 
cost of revenues increased due to growth in case volumes and higher employee related costs associated with the cost of laboratory personnel and cartesian physicians  as well as increased overhead from facilities expansion efforts 
overall  this resulted in increased gross profit per case of for  as compared to  and increased gross profit per case of for  as compared to we expect to experience downward pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in as we complete improvements on our newly acquired laboratory facility and make capital expenditures to purchase new laboratory equipment and hire additional laboratory technicians  support personnel and hempaths for these facilities see liquidity and capital resources in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results 
additionally  we expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase  due to increased laboratory supplies  personnel  and logistic costs to support growing case volumes 
these costs are expected to be partially offset by further leveraging of our fixed costs and efficiencies gained for improvements in our processes 
overall  we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margins  to be in the high range for sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related costs salaries  commissions  fringe benefits  stock based compensation and related training and travel costs for our sales personnel in the field and administrative related costs allocated to sales and marketing functions 
as part of our growth strategy  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we hire additional field sales representatives and strengthen our organization with the addition of mid level management and training personnel to more fully develop our sales territories 
we currently expect to grow our field sales representatives to approximately over the next two to three years 
we increased hiring efforts to significantly increase the number of field sales representatives during the fourth quarter of  from at the end of the third quarter to as of december  these field sales representatives will increase our geographic reach and enhance our relations with existing customers 

table of contents years ended december  change sales and marketing expenses in thousands sales and marketing expenses as a of revenues sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december   increasing and from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december  and remained consistent at  as compared to a decrease from for the year ended december   due to higher revenues and efficiencies that have been gained since the increases of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  over each preceding year  were primarily due to incremental increases of million and million  respectively  for employee related costs including salaries  sales commissions  stock based compensation expense and travel and other cost increases due to the increased number of field sales representatives  sales managers and customer service personnel that we hired to drive and support our revenue growth 
facility and equipment costs related to sales and marketing increased incrementally by million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to increased headcount and related facility allocations 
consulting costs increased incrementally by million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to promotional activities during the year 
we anticipate sales and marketing expense will increase in  both in total and as a percentage of revenues  due to additional headcount including increases to salaries  sales commissions  stock based compensation expense and travel and additional marketing activities offset by increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses relate to billing  finance  human resources and other administrative functions consisting of employee related costs including salaries  fringe benefits and stock based compensation  professional services  depreciation and other costs allocated to general and administrative functions 
in addition  the provision for doubtful accounts is included in general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate increases in our general and administrative expenses as we add personnel  continue to comply with the reporting obligations applicable to publicly held companies  incur additional expenses associated with the expansion of our facilities into our newly leased office space and backup systems  and continue to build our corporate infrastructure to support our anticipated growth 
years ended december  change general and administrative expenses in thousands general and administrative expenses as a of revenues during the year ended december   we recorded positive changes in prior period accounting estimates to reduce the allowance for doubtful accounts  which decreased general and administrative expenses by  this positive change in accounting estimates was the result of continued improvements to our collection processes  as well as favorable experience in the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable for services rendered in prior periods and changes in reimbursement policies by certain payors 
there were no similar changes in prior period accounting estimates during the years ended december  and general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   increasing and from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively inclusive of the change in prior period accounting estimates noted above 
the increases of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  over each 
table of contents preceding year  were primarily due to incremental increases of million and million  respectively  for employee related costs including salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation expense and travel 
employee related costs increased as a result of a increase in total general and administrative headcount to as of december   up from as of december   and from as of december   in support of overall company growth 
in addition  we have expanded our infrastructure by enhancing our is and implementing finance initiatives to improve billing and support for our continued overall growth 
the provision for doubtful accounts incrementally increased million from december  to  however  it remained flat into due to stronger than expected collections  resulting in a lowered provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue in going forward  we expect our provision for doubtful accounts to approximate of revenues 
legal and consulting expenses increased as a result of regulatory initiatives  corporate and business development  increased contract management and ongoing development and maintenance of our compliance programs 
these incremental increases were offset by million for the year ended december   due to allocations to cost of revenues and sales and marketing associated with our facility and equipment improvements and deployment of previously undeveloped space within our existing facility  as compared to an increase of expense of  from to as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses we experienced in pertains to costs related to our first full year as a public company and increased support personnel costs due to our growth and various corporate initiatives  which were offset by a increase in revenues for the same year 
in comparison  the decrease to for the year ended december  from in  resulted from higher revenues  lower provision for doubtful accounts and increased leverage of costs as we continued to grow 
although we anticipate total general and administrative expenses to increase in  we expect to see a slight decline in general administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
interest and other income years ended december  change in thousands interest and other income interest expense interest and other income decreased to million for the year ended december   down from million and up from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily the result of lower investment returns and the partial shift in our investment portfolio into tax exempt municipal securities that will be beneficial in lowering our effective tax rate 
the increase was primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents and investment securities from our ipo proceeds and cash provided by operations 
we intend to continue to manage our investments to maximize our returns while minimizing our risk 
the decrease in interest expense is a result of our repayment of borrowings during the year ended december   in connection with our ipo 
no new borrowings or related interest expense are expected 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense for the year ended december  was million 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million and income tax expense for the year ended december  was  we had million in net deferred tax assets as of december  that were offset entirely by a valuation allowance  as we were unable to conclude  at that time  that it was more likely than not that such deferred tax assets would be realized 
as of december   although realization was not assured  
table of contents we believed it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets through the ordinary course of business and expected future taxable income 
therefore  during the year ended december   we recorded a million tax benefit representing the release of the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had million in net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal and state net operating losses will begin to expire in and  respectively 
as of december   we had no federal research tax credit carryforwards and state research credit carryforwards of approximately  which do not expire 
our taxable income for significantly utilized the remaining available federal net operating losses with any remaining deferred tax assets to be utilized in subsequent years 
due to our sustained profitability  our future effective tax rate will be approximately of income before taxes 
this rate is subject to the impact of nondeductible stock based compensation expense offset by any tax deductions from disqualifying dispositions 
liquidity and capital resources the following tables present a summary of our liquidity and cash flows december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consisting of municipal securities  government sponsored enterprise securities  corporate debt securities  us treasury securities and certificates of deposit 
we have established a policy and guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investment securities to minimize overall risk with the objectives of preserving principal and maintaining liquidity while maximizing our returns 
our certificates of deposit are fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic 
our primary sources of cash are from trade accounts receivable and proceeds from common stock issuances 
collections of accounts receivable are impacted by the efficiency of our cash collections process as measured by the change in dso 
dso can vary from period to period depending on the payment cycles and the mix of our payors 
our dso averaged days in  which was consistent with days in as of december  and  our dso was days and days  respectively 
the increase in our dso as of december   pertains primarily to the timing of payments relating to certain contracted payors 
the decrease in our dso we experienced as of december  was the result of continued improvements to our billing and collection systems and processes 
we expect to maintain our average dso levels into as we continue to pursue improvements to collection procedures and work with our payors to ensure timely processing of reimbursement payments 

table of contents our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses  income taxes  and the acquisition of property and equipment 
cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of payments as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses 
acquisitions of property and equipment generally consist of cash payments for facility improvements and purchases of laboratory equipment and computer hardware and software 
income tax payments consist of federal and state payments of an approximately effective tax rate  since the majority of our net operating losses and other credits have been exhausted 
we expect our future effective tax rate will be approximately of income before taxes 
we expect our capital expenditures to increase significantly during specifically  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for including approximately million for improvements to our new facilities and million to purchase the new facility and land see note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures totaled million 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was million  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to changes in accounts receivable  accrued compensation and accrued income taxes 
our accounts receivable increased due to higher revenues from test volume increases and the increased selling price per test 
the change in accrued compensation is due to additional headcount and the timing of our compensation payments 
the increase in income taxes is due to our status as a fully taxable entity while sustaining continued profitability 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   was million  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this was primarily due to the increase in the net purchases of investment securities of million offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   was million  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this was primarily due to net proceeds from the employee stock transactions and excess tax benefits related to disqualifying dispositions on stock based compensation awards 
the significant cash inflow from financing activities during the year ended december  represents proceeds from our initial public offering 
liquidity restrictions as of december   we held a single ars with a fair value of million 
the ars had a cost basis of million  which was net of a temporary impairment of million as of december  due to the current illiquidity of the investment security 
as such  we classified the ars as a long term investment security 
ars are collateralized debt instruments with long term contractual maturities that are structured with short term holding periods 
they provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  typically every to days 
the length of each holding period is determined at the original issuance of the ars 
we can sell at each auction at par  assuming there are buyers for the ars at such auction 
in order for the auction to be successful  demand in the marketplace must meet or exceed the supply 
if an auction is unsuccessful  the interest rate on the security resets at a predetermined auction failure rate 
an investor can continue to hold the investment security until the next auction date or attempt to sell in the secondary market  usually at a sizable discount 
the ars in our investment securities portfolio consists of debt issued by a municipality that is also underwritten by an insurance agency 
the ars auctions began failing in february as of december   the ars was rated baa by moody s investors service and a by standard poor s based on the 
table of contents underwriter s guarantee 
although unsuccessful  the last auction occurred on september   prior to the bankruptcy of the broker dealer that managed the auction 
the funds associated with this security will not be accessible until the issuer restructures the debt  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the ars matures in as such  we have recorded a temporary impairment of approximately million as of december  the issuer continues to pay the interest as scheduled and shows no indication that it will be unable to meet its current obligations 
we do not need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
because we do not need the current liquidity  we will hold the security until the auctions begin occurring  the issuer restructures the debt or until the contractual maturity date 
based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment securities and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the temporary illiquidity of this investment will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december   we had total restricted cash of  restricted cash consists of amounts held in a certificate of deposit to collateralize a standby letter of credit per the terms of an operating lease agreement 
the standby letter of credit requirement expires in  allowing for  annual reductions on june of each year through capital resources we believe that our internal cash flows along with our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments should be adequate to fund our planned growth and operating activities through at least the next months 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the current economy and financial markets  changes in regulations or payor policies  including reimbursement levels from governmental payors and private insurers  or contracting arrangements with payors or changes in other laws  regulations or policies  and the extent to which we expand our operations and increase our market share 
over the next months  we estimate the costs associated with expanding our operations to be approximately million 
this cost consists of the costs associated with our newly acquired laboratory facility and customer service and support facility of approximately million and the costs associated with additional capital expenditures of approximately million 
we may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses and or technologies complementary to our business 
such an acquisition could require significant additional capital resources 
we could be required to raise additional equity or debt financing if we were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
we may be required to or otherwise may for strategic or other reasons elect to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
we do not know if we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all particularly in light of the difficult current financial environment and weak economic conditions 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  we may not be able to maintain or grow our business at the rate that we currently anticipate and we may not be able to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements  or we may be required to reduce operating expenses  which would significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we do not have any outstanding debt 
we do not anticipate having to obtain any form of debt in the near future 

table of contents income tax as of december   most remaining and available federal and state income tax net operating losses and other credits have been utilized  which will result in increased income tax payments and decrease our cash flows from operations 
as of december   we had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
however  california suspended the use of its state tax net operating loss carryforward until  which will cause us to be fully taxed in california without the benefit of net operating losses in the federal and state net operating losses will begin to expire in and  respectively 
as of december   we had no federal research tax credit carryforwards and state research carryforwards of approximately  which do not expire 
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  credit carryforwards and certain deductions have been subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
under sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership have required us to limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that were previously available to offset future taxable income 
we have had three change in ownership events that limit the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
the change in ownership events occurred in march  december and march and resulted in annual net operating loss carryforward limitations of   and million  respectively 
as a result of a net unrealized built in gain from the march change in ownership  our net operating loss carryforward annual limitation of million was increased to million for each of the five years starting after the change in ownership 
additional limitations on the use of these tax attributes could occur in the event of possible disputes arising in examination from various taxing authorities 
in august  the irs commenced an examination of our us federal income tax return for the tax year ended december  to date  there have been no proposed adjustments communicated to management 
while we believe we are adequately reserved  if the examination results in an unfavorable outcome  there could be a material impact on the financial results in the period the outcome is determined 
we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax in jurisdictions of each state having an income tax 
the tax years that remain subject to examination are for federal income taxes and for state income taxes  including years ending thereafter 
however  to the extent allowed by law  the tax authorities may have the right to examine prior periods where net operating losses or tax credits were generated and carried forward  and make adjustments up to the amount of the net operating losses or credit carry forward amount 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents a summary of our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands purchase obligations operating leases from time to time  we may enter into contracts with suppliers  manufacturers and other third parties under which we may be required to make payments 
the table above does not reflect any future obligations that may arise due to further expansion of our laboratory facilities  including facility leasing costs  tenant improvements and other facility startup and infrastructure costs 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements see note in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged and do not expect to engage in any off balance sheet activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in us interest rates 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
interest rate risk all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
if a basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in  our interest income would change by approximately  in relation to amounts we would expect to earn assuming investment securities balances and types of investment securities are consistent with those as of december  concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents with three financial institutions 
such cash balances  at times  may exceed fdic limits 
to date  we have not experienced any losses in such accounts
