item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition loans 
changes in interest rates could affect profitability the ability to earn a profit  like most financial institutions  depends on the net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income that the bank earns on its interest bearing assets  such as loans and investments  and the interest expense that the bank pays on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
the bank s profitability depends on its ability to manage its assets and liabilities during periods of changing market interest rates 
a sustained decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect the bank s earnings 
when interest rates decline  borrowers tend to refinance higher rate  fixed rate loans at lower rates 
under those circumstances  the bank would not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on those prepaid loans or in investment securities 
in addition  the majority of the bank s loans are at variable interest rates  which would adjust to lower rates 
in a period of rising interest rates  the interest income earned on the bank s assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on its liabilities 
in an increasing interest rate environment  the bank s cost of funds is expected to increase more rapidly than interest earned on its loan and investment portfolio as the primary source of funds is deposits with generally shorter maturities than those on its loans and investments 
this makes the balance sheet more liability sensitive in the short term 
geographic location and competition the bank s market area is located in suffolk county on eastern long island and its customer base is mainly located in the towns of east hampton  southampton  southold and riverhead 
in  the bank expanded its market areas to include a branch in shirley  new york located in the town of brookhaven 
during the bank plans to continue to expand westward to center moriches and patchogue  new york located in the town of brookhaven and deer park  new york located within the town of babylon 
competition in the banking and financial services industry remains intense 
the profitability of the bank depends on the continued ability to successfully compete 
the bank competes with commercial banks  savings banks  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the bank and may offer certain services that the bank does not provide 
in addition  competitors recently have been offering deposits at higher rates and loans with lower fixed rates  more attractive terms and less stringent credit structures than the bank has been willing to offer 
furthermore  the high cost of living on the twin forks of eastern long island creates staff recruitment and retention challenges 
the company s future depends on successful growth of its subsidiary the company s primary business activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as the holding company of the bank 
therefore  the company s future profitability will depend on the success and growth of this subsidiary 
the loss of key personnel could impair our future success our future success depends in part on the continued service of our executive officers  other key management  as well as our staff  and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate  and retain additional highly qualified employees 
the loss of services of one or more of our key personnel or our inability to timely recruit replacements for such personnel  or to otherwise attract  motivate  or retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition

highly regulated environment the bank and company are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the occ  fdic  the federal reserve board and the sec 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the consumer 
recently regulators have intensified their focus on the usa patriot act s anti money laundering and bank secrecy act compliance requirements 
in order to comply with regulations  guidelines and examination procedures in this area as well as other areas of the bank  we have been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems 
we cannot be certain that the policies  procedures  and systems we have in place are flawless and there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  may have a material impact on our operations 
we may be adversely affected by current economic and market conditions the national and global economic downturn that began in has resulted in unprecedented levels of financial market volatility which may depress the market value of financial institutions  limit access to capital or have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of banking companies 
since significant declines in the values of mortgage backed securities and derivative securities by financial institutions  government sponsored entities  and major commercial and investment banks has led to decreased confidence in financial markets among borrowers  lenders  and depositors  as well as disruption and extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets and the failure of some entities in the financial sector 
as a result  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
while financial markets appear to be stabilizing and there are a few positive signs of economic recovery including increased local real estate activity  economic uncertainty remains 
unemployment rates are high and consumer confidence is low 
while the timing of an economic recovery remains unknown this may have an adverse affect on the company 
turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us 
increases to the allowance for credit losses may cause our earnings to decrease our customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms  and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
hence  we may experience significant loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses  we rely on loan quality reviews  past loss experience  and an evaluation of economic conditions  among other factors 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to the allowance 
material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income 
bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and or financial condition 
increases in fdic insurance premiums may cause our earnings to decrease the emergency economic stabilization act eesa temporarily increased the limit on fdic coverage to  through june  in addition  we have enrolled in the temporary liquidity guarantee program for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts 
on february   the fdic issued a final rule  effective april   to change the way that the fdic s assessment system differentiates for risk and to set new assessment rates beginning with the second quarter of in may  the fdic issued a final rule to impose an emergency special assessment of basis points on all banks based on their total assets less tier one capital as of june  the special assessment was payable on september  during the second quarter of  the company recorded an expense of  related to the fdic special assessment 
in november  the fdic issued a final rule that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and the fdic also adopted a uniform basis point increase in assessment rates effective on january  the company s prepayment of fdic assessments on december  was million which will be amortized to expense over three years 
this  along with the full utilization or our assessment credit in early and the increase in fdic insurance rates  caused the premiums assessed by the fdic to increase 
these actions have significantly increased our expense in and will continue to affect our earnings in future years as long as the increased premiums are in place

significant events the economic events of the past two years have been unprecedented 
during  the failure of several large financial institutions along with the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac driven by the diminution in housing values and sub prime mortgage lending has resulted in multiple actions by the united states government 
on october   the congress passed the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa which provides up to billion and grants new authorities to the united states treasury department treasury  the federal reserve board frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic for initiatives to restore stability and liquidity to us markets 
many european nations have also taken actions to inject liquidity and capital into critical financial institutions in order to stabilize world markets 
on october   the treasury  frb and fdic jointly announced a sweeping plan to invest in banks and thrifts to help restore confidence in the us banking system 
some of the actions taken by these governmental agencies included i temporarily increasing fdic insurance coverage to  from   ii reducing the targeted federal funds rate to between and from and the discount rate to from  respectively  iii temporarily guaranteeing money market mutual funds iv introducing a capital purchase program whereby the treasury will purchase up to billion in senior preferred shares from healthy qualifying financial institutions  and v introducing a temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp whereby the fdic will guarantee newly issued senior unsecured debt on or before june  and provide unlimited fdic insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts for thirty days without charge followed by an annualized basis point assessment for the insurance coverage above  on such accounts effective until december  in november  the bank opted to participate in the tlgp 
in  the fdic s guarantee of unsecured debt was extended to october  and the fdic insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts to  was extended to june  in order to ensure a smooth phase out of the debt guaranteed program on october   the fdic established a limited emergency guarantee facility 
if an institution is unable to issue non guaranteed debt to replace the maturing senior unsecured debt as of october   the institution can apply for an emergency guarantee facility 
if the application is approved  the fdic will guarantee the senior unsecured debt issued on or before april  participating institutions will pay the fdic a fee equal to an annualized assessment rate of a minimum of basis points 
one of the provisions resulting from the eesa was the treasury s capital purchase program cpp  which provided direct equity investment of perpetual preferred stock by the treasury in qualified financial institutions 
the program is voluntary and requires an institution to comply with a number of restrictions and provisions  including limits on executive compensation  stock redemptions and declaration of dividends 
applications were due by november  and were subject to approval by the treasury 
in november  the company filed an application to participate in this program 
in order to be eligible to participate in this program  the company also filed a proxy statement in november requesting shareholder approval to amend its certificate of incorporation and authorize the issuance of preferred stock 
on december   the shareholders approved the proposal and on january  the company s application to participate in this program was approved by the treasury department 
on january   management and the board  after careful deliberation and thoughtful review of the relevant issues  determined it was not in our shareholders best interest to participate  and declined the treasury investment 
on february   the fdic issued a final rule  effective april   to change the way that the fdic s assessment system differentiates for risk and to set new assessment rates beginning with the second quarter of in may  the fdic issued a final rule to impose an emergency special assessment of basis points on all banks based on their total assets less tier one capital as of june  the special assessment was payable on september  during the second quarter of  the company recorded an expense of  related to the fdic special assessment

on january   the fdic approved an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that requested feedback from the public on whether employee compensation plans pose risks that should be reflected in the deposit insurance assessment program 
the fdic is concerned that certain compensation structures may encourage risk taking that can result in losses in the financial system

table of contents opportunities and challenges the economic and competitive landscape has changed dramatically over the past two years 
recognizing that our market areas are generally affluent  large money center banks increasingly meet their funding needs by aggressively pricing deposits in the bank s markets 
competition for deposits and loans is intense as various banks in the marketplace  large and small  promise excellent service yet often price their products aggressively 
deposit growth is essential to the bank s ability to increase earnings  therefore branch expansion and building share in our existing markets remain key strategic goals 
controlling funding costs yet protecting the deposit base along with focusing on profitable growth  presents a unique set of challenges in this operating environment 
since the second half of and continuing through  the financial markets experienced significant volatility resulting from the continued fallout of sub prime lending and the global liquidity crises 
a multitude of government initiatives along with eight rate cuts by the federal reserve totaling basis points have been designed to improve liquidity for the distressed financial markets 
the ultimate objective of these efforts has been to help the beleaguered consumer  and reduce the potential surge of residential mortgage loan foreclosures and stabilize the banking system 
despite these actions  many of our competitors  due to liquidity concerns  have not yet fully adjusted their deposit pricing 
this contrasts with the impact on assets where yields on loans and securities have declined 
the squeeze between declining asset yields and more slowly declining liability pricing has impacted margins 
effective as of february   the federal reserve increased the discount rate basis points to 
the federal reserve stated that this rate change was intended to normalize their lending facility and to step away from emergency lending to banks 
growth and service strategies have the potential to offset the tighter net interest margin with volume as the customer base grows through expanding the bank s footprint  while maintaining and developing existing relationships 
since  the bank has opened five new branches 
in january  the bank opened a new branch in the village of southampton  in february  in cutchogue  and in september  in wading river 
in april  the bank opened a new branch in shirley  new york  and in december  the bank opened a state of the art branch facility in the village of east hampton 
the opening of the branch facilities in wading river and shirley  move the bank geographically westward and demonstrate our commitment to traditional growth through branch expansion 
in november  the bank received approval from the office of the comptroller of the currency occ to open a new branch facility in deer park  new york 
in addition  in july  the bank received approval from the occ to open a new branch in center moriches  new york  and in march  the bank received approval from the occ to open a new branch in patchogue  new york 
the bank anticipates opening the center moriches branch in the first half of the deer park and patchogue branch locations are expected to open during the second half of the bank routinely adds to its menu of products and services  continually meeting the needs of consumers and businesses 
we believe positive outcomes in the future will result from the expansion of our geographic footprint  investments in infrastructure and technology  such as bridgenexus  our remote deposit capture product  lockbox processing  and continued focus on placing our customers first 
in january  the bank launched bridge investment services  offering a full range of investment products and services through a third party broker dealer 
the bank plans to roll out its new commercial online bill paying service  as well as a new mobile banking product during the first half of as begins there is still significant economic uncertainty 
unemployment remains high  confidence is low and consumers and businesses face a myriad of challenges from higher taxes to increased regulations 
while there have been some recent positive signs and real estate activity has increased  management remains cautious about the timeline for a true economic recovery 
corporate objectives for include leveraging our expanding branch network to build customer relationships and grow loans and deposits  focusing on opportunities and processes that continue to enhance the customer experience at the bank  improving operational efficiencies and prudent management of non interest expense  and maximizing non interest income through bridge abstract as well as other lines of business 
the ability to attract  retain  train and cultivate employees at all levels of the company remains significant to meeting these objectives 
the company has made great progress toward the achievement of these objectives  and avoided many of the problems facing other financial institutions as a result of maintaining discipline in its underwriting  expansion strategies  investing and general business practices 
the company has capitalized on opportunities presented by the market in and continues during to diligently seek opportunities for growth and to strengthen the franchise

management and the board have built a solid foundation for growth and the company is positioned to adapt to anticipated changes in the industry resulting from new regulations and legislative initiatives

table of contents critical accounting policies note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
our policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is our most critical accounting policy 
this policy is important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policy and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying its application 
allowance for loan losses management considers the accounting policy on the allowance for loan losses to be the most critical and requires complex management judgment as discussed below 
the judgments made regarding the allowance for loan losses can have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances 
if the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  the company s earnings could decrease 
the bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis  with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans  repayment patterns  probable incurred losses  past loss experience  current economic conditions  and various types of concentrations of credit 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged to the allowance 
individual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process including the procedures for impairment testing under fasb accounting standard codification asc no 
 receivables 
such valuation  which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured  considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell  if any  or the present value of expected future cash flows  or the loan s observable market value 
any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan 
pursuant to our policy  loan losses must be charged off in the period the loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
assumptions and judgments by management  in conjunction with outside sources  are used to determine whether full collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured 
these assumptions and judgments are also used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market value 
individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired 
the results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses 
loan pool valuation allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risks associated with our lending activities  but which  unlike individual allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
pool evaluations are broken down as follows first  loans with homogenous characteristics are pooled by loan type and include home equity loans  residential mortgages  land loans and consumer loans 
then all remaining loans are segregated into pools based upon the risk rating of each credit 
key factors in determining a credit s risk rating include management s evaluation of cash flow  collateral  guarantor support  financial disclosures  industry trends and strength of borrowers management 
the determination of the adequacy of the valuation allowance is a process that takes into consideration a variety of factors 
the bank has developed a range of valuation allowances necessary to adequately provide for probable incurred losses inherent in each pool of loans 
we consider our own charge off history along with the growth in the portfolio as well as the bank s credit administration and asset management philosophies and procedures when determining the allowances for each pool 
in addition  we evaluate and consider the impact that economic and market conditions may have on the portfolio as well as known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
finally  we evaluate and consider the allowance ratios and coverage percentages of both peer group and regulatory agency data 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  even though they are based on objective data  it is management s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance 
if the evaluations prove to be incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio  resulting in additions to the allowance for loan losses 
page 
table of contents the classification committee is comprised of members of both management and the board of directors 
the adequacy of the allowance is analyzed quarterly  with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate by the classification committee  based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio 
based on the classification committee s review of the classified loans and the overall allowance levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at december   management believes the allowance for loan losses has been established at levels sufficient to cover the probable incurred losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic  market or other conditions 
changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination 
for additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses  see note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents rate volume analysis net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changes in rates and volumes 
the following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in the volume of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rates changes in rates multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net changes 
for purposes of this table  changes that are not due solely to volume or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate

table of contents loans of approximately million or of total loans at december  were classified as potential problem loans compared to million or at december  and million or at december  these loans are classified as potential problem loans as management has information that indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with the present repayment terms 
these loans are subject to increased management attention and their classification is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis 
the increase in the level of potential problem loans reflects the current economic environment as well as management s decision to enhance the asset and credit quality review process of the loan portfolio 
this process includes the early identification of potential problem loans  a more stringent assessment of potential credit weaknesses and expanding the scope and depth of individual credit reviews 
at december   approximately million of these loans are commercial real estate cre loans which are current and well secured with real estate as collateral 
in addition  all but million of the cre loans have personal guarantees 
the remaining million in classified loans are unsecured and current  have personal guarantees and demonstrate sufficient cash flow to pay the loans 
due to the structure and nature of the credits  we do not expect to sustain a material loss on these relationships 
cre loans represented million or of the total loan portfolio at december  compared to million or at december  and million or at december  the bank s underwriting standards for cre loans requires an evaluation of the cash flow of the property  the overall cash flow of the borrower and related guarantors as well as the value of the real estate securing the loan

as of december  and december   the company had impaired loans as defined by fasb asc no 
 receivables of million and million  respectively 
for a loan to be considered impaired  management determines after review whether it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
additionally management applies its normal loan review procedures in making these judgments 
impaired loans include individually classified nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructured tdr loans 
for impaired and tdr loans  the bank evaluates the fair value of the loan in accordance with fasb asc for loans that are collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the fair value of the loan 
the fair value of the collateral is determined based upon recent appraised values 
for unsecured loans  the fair value is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
the fair value of the loan is compared to the carrying value to determine if any write down or specific reserve is required 
these methods of fair value measurement for impaired and tdr loans are considered level within the fair value hierarchy described in fasb asc nonaccrual loans increased million to million or of total loans at december  from million or of total loans at december  approximately million of the nonaccrual loans at december  represent troubled debt restructured loans where the borrowers are complying with the modified terms of the loans and are currently making payments 
in  nonaccrual loans increased million to million from million in the increase in non accrual loans at december  was due to a single loan of approximately million 
in addition  the company has one borrower with tdr loans of million at december  that are current and are secured with collateral that has a fair value of approximately million as well as personal guarantors 
management believes that the ultimate collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured and therefore continues to recognize interest income on an accrual basis 
in addition  the bank has no commitment to lend additional funds to this debtor 
the loan was determined to be impaired during the third quarter of and since that determination  of interest income has been recognized 
there were no loans considered to be trouble debt restructurings at december  the bank had no foreclosed real estate at december   and  respectively

the company continues its long term trend of uninterrupted dividends 
loans during  the company continued to experience growth trends in commercial and residential real estate lending 
the concentration of loans in our primary market areas may increase risk 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  the bank s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial and residential real estate properties located in the bank s principal lending area on eastern long island 
the markets in which the company operates have experienced substantial growth in construction and land development activity over the past several years  which has been a factor in overall loan growth 
the local economic conditions on eastern long island have a significant impact on the volume of loan originations and the quality of our loans  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of collateral securing these loans 
a considerable decline in the general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond the company s control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of the company s operations 
additionally  while the company has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans  the majority of which are owner occupied  decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
the interest rates charged by the bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  the rates offered by its competitors  the bank s relationship with the customer  and the related credit risks of the transaction 
these factors are affected by general and economic conditions including  but not limited to  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters 
the bank targets its business lending and marketing initiatives towards promotion of loans that primarily meet the needs of small to medium sized businesses 
these small to medium sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
if general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses  the results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
with respect to the underwriting of loans  there are certain risks  including the risk of non payment that is associated with each type of loan that the bank markets 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio at december  is secured by real estate and approximately is comprised of commercial real estate loans

real estate construction loans comprise approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 
risks associated with a concentration in real estate loans include potential losses from fluctuating values of land and improved properties 
home equity loans represent loans originated in the bank s geographic markets with original loan to value ratios generally of or less 
the bank s residential mortgage portfolio includes approximately million in interest only mortgages 
the underwriting standards for interest only mortgages are consistent with the remainder of the loan portfolio and do not include any features that result in negative amortization 
largest loan concentrations by industry are loans granted to lessors of commercial property both owner occupied and nonowner occupied 
the bank uses conservative underwriting criteria to better insulate itself from a downturn in real estate values and economic conditions on eastern long island that could have a significant impact on the value of collateral securing the loans as well as the ability of customers to repay loans 
the remainder of the loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and consumer loans  which represent approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans are the cash flow of the business  the experience and quality of the borrowers management  the business climate  and the impact of economic factors 
the primary risks associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower  such as the risk of a borrower s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the amount and nature of a borrower s other existing indebtedness  and the value of the collateral securing the loan if the bank must take possession of the collateral 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or in the same magnitude  as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve bank 
impact of prospective accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note r of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management considers interest rate risk to be the most significant market risk for the company 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net income of the company as a result of changes in interest rates 
the company s primary earnings source is net interest income  which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the relationship between rates  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments  the level and composition of deposits and liabilities  and the credit quality of earning assets 
the company s objectives in its asset and liability management are to maintain a strong  stable net interest margin  to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks  to maintain adequate liquidity  and to reduce vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company s asset and liability committee evaluates periodically  but at least four times a year  the impact of changes in market interest rates on assets and liabilities  net interest margin  capital and liquidity 
risk assessments are governed by policies and limits established by senior management  which are reviewed and approved by the full board of directors at least annually 
the economic environment continually presents uncertainties as to future interest rate trends 
the asset and liability committee regularly utilizes a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates  in order to be better able to respond to changes in interest rates 
at december   million or of the company s securities had fixed interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the value of the company s interest earning assets and in particular its securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets  which could adversely affect the company s stockholders equity and its results of operations if sold 
the company is also subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates also could affect the type fixed rate or adjustable rate and amount of loans originated by the company and the average life of loans and securities  which can impact the yields earned on the company s loans and securities 
changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
in periods of decreasing interest rates  the average life of loans and securities held by the company may be shortened to the extent increased prepayment activity occurs during such periods which  in turn  may result in the investment of funds from such prepayments in lower yielding assets 
under these circumstances the company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may result in decreasing loan prepayments with respect to fixed rate loans and therefore an increase in the average life of such loans  may result in a decrease in loan demand  and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans

table of contents the company utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
management routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon 
the simulation model captures the seasonality of the company s deposit flows and the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and the interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to the asset and liability policy limits that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given a and basis point upward shift in interest rates and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a twelve month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis at december  potential change in net change in interest interest income rates in basis points change change dollars in thousands static the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shapes  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon perceived current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences may change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals  prepayment penalties and product preference changes and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to  or anticipating changes in interest rates and market conditions
