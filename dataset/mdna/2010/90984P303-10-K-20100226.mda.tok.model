item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion is intended to provide insight into the financial condition and results of operations of united and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
operating loss and operating loss per diluted share are non gaap performance measures 
united s management believes that operating performance is useful in analyzing the company s financial performance trends since it excludes items that are non recurring in nature and therefore most of the discussion in this section will refer to operating performance measures 
a reconciliation of these operating performance measures to gaap performance measures is included in the table on page since mid  and continuing through  the financial markets and economic conditions generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
this was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to all residential construction  and residential mortgages as property prices declined rapidly and to nearly all asset classes 
the effect of the market and economic downturn also spread to other areas of the credit markets and in the availability of liquidity 
the magnitude of these declines led to a crisis of confidence in the financial sector as a result of concerns about the capital base and viability of certain financial institutions 
during this period  interbank lending and commercial paper borrowing fell sharply  precipitating a credit freeze for both institutional and individual borrowers 
unemployment has also increased significantly 
these events created serious concerns about the safety and soundness of the entire financial services industry 
the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act of was signed into law in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system  financial markets and economic conditions generally 
pursuant to eesa  treasury has the authority under the troubled asset relief program to purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
treasury announced the capital purchase program under tarp pursuant to which it has purchased and will continue to purchase senior preferred stock in participating financial institutions 
the eesa followed  and has been followed by  numerous actions by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the us congress  treasury  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the sec and others to address the current crisis  including the american recovery and reinvestment act of united s markets have been severely disrupted by the weak housing market which resulted in the buildup of surplus housing and finished lot inventory  particularly within the atlanta  georgia msa and north and coastal georgia  which has put considerable stress on the residential construction portion of united s loan portfolio 
the weak economic conditions spread beyond the housing market  pushing unemployment to levels not seen in decades 
as a result  united reported a net loss of million in  which included non cash charges of million for goodwill impairment  a million charge for a reduction in workforce  and a gain of million for the acquisition of southern community bank scb 
this compared to a net loss of million in united s net operating loss for was million  which excludes the gain on acquisition  goodwill impairment and severance costs  compared to a net operating loss of million for the twelve months ended december  diluted operating loss per common share was for the year ended december   compared with a diluted operating loss per common share of for the gain on acquisition  goodwill impairment and severance costs represented per share  per share and per share  respectively  for the year  bringing the net loss per common share to 
the increased loss from reflected higher credit losses and the goodwill impairment charges  offset by net interest margin improvement resulting from lower deposit pricing  wider credit spreads in loan pricing and the elimination of much of the excess liquidity built up at the end of united s approach to managing through the challenging economic cycle has been to aggressively deal with its credit problems and dispose of troubled assets quickly  taking losses as necessary 
as a result  united s provision for loan losses was million in compared with million in net charge offs for were million compared with million in at the end of  united s allowance for loan losses of million was of loans compared with million or of loans at the end of  and total non performing assets were million compared with million at the end of taxable equivalent net interest revenue was million for  up million from the increase in net interest revenue was the result of the basis point improvement in the net interest margin which increased from in to in the weak economic conditions of were reflected in other components of united s earnings  however some areas began to show improvement from the prior year 
operating fee revenue of million was up million or from mortgage and related fees increased due to a significant rise in refinancing activity  as mortgage rates fell to historical lows 
consulting fees increased due to the demand for regulatory compliance assistance services 
brokerage fees dropped as uncertainty in the financial markets continued 
in  united also recognized a gain of million related to the fdic assisted acquisition of scb which is not included in operating fee revenue 
the gain resulted from the bargain purchase since the purchase price was less than the value of the net assets and liabilities received 
united continued to control expenses in  through a reduction in headcount and further lowering of discretionary spending such as advertising and public relations expense and postage  printing and supplies expense 
operating expenses for were million  an increase of million  or from higher foreclosed property expense and fdic insurance expense accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase in operating expenses 
in addition  united recorded million in goodwill impairment charges in which is not reported in operating expenses 
at the end of  united held million in commercial paper as short term investments and million in other short term funds as part of its continued emphasis on liquidity 
loans at december  were billion  down million from the end of  due to united s efforts to reduce exposure to residential construction loans 
totaling billion  residential construction loans at december  represented of outstanding loans  down from at the end of  a decrease of million 
deposits were down million to billion  as united focused on reducing interest expense  allowing runoff of cd s from a previous promotion 
at the same time  united s focus was to increase low cost core transaction deposits which grew million in at the end of  total equity capital was million  down million from december  reflecting the net loss of  offset by the sale of million in common stock at the end of the third quarter of the loss includes non cash charges of million for goodwill impairment  which reduced shareholders equity but had no impact on regulatory capital 
the additional capital leaves all of united s regulatory capital ratios significantly above well capitalized levels 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon future events 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record the valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies for united are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements 
management considers the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses  fair value measurements  intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on non impaired loans based on historical loss experience  management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all non accrual loans over  which are considered impaired loans 
these analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the historical loss element is determined using the average of actual losses incurred over the prior two years for each type of loan 
the historical loss experience is adjusted for known changes in economic conditions and credit quality trends such as changes in the amount of past due and nonperforming loans 
the resulting loss allocation factors are applied to the balance of each type of loan after removing the balance of impaired loans and other specifically allocated loans from each category 
the loss allocation factors are updated annually 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations of credit and changes in portfolio mix 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetectable losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  the unallocated allowance includes a component that accounts for the inherent imprecision in loan loss estimation based on historical loss experience as a result of united s growth through acquisitions  which have expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
also  loss data representing a complete economic cycle is not available for all sectors 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical losses used in developing loss allocation factors may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its processes for determining the allowance adequately consider all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
additional information on united s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses can be found in the sections of management s discussion and analysis titled asset quality and risk elements and nonperforming assets and in the sections of part i  item titled lending policy and loan review and non performing assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information on united s accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses 
fair value measurements united s impaired loans and foreclosed assets may be measured and carried at fair value  the determination of which requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments 
at december   the percentage of total assets measured at fair value was 
see note fair value in the consolidated financial statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
when a loan is considered impaired  a specific valuation allowance is allocated  if necessary  so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
in addition  foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell  following foreclosure 
fair value is defined by gaap as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
gaap further defines an orderly transaction as a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets it is not a forced transaction for example  a forced liquidation or distress sale 
recently in the bank s markets there have been very few transactions in the type of assets which represent the vast majority of the bank s impaired loans and foreclosed properties which reflect orderly transactions as so defined 
instead  most transactions in comparable assets have been distressed sales not indicative of fair value 
accordingly  the determination of fair value in the current environment is difficult and more subjective than it would be in a stable real estate environment 
although management believes its processes for determining the value of these assets are appropriate factors and allow united to arrive at a fair value  the processes require management judgment and assumptions and the value of such assets at the time they are revalued or divested may be significantly different from management s determination of fair value 
in addition  because of this increased subjectivity in fair value determinations  there is greater than usual grounds for differences in opinions  which may result in increased disagreements between management and the bank s regulators  disagreements which could impair the relationship between the bank and its regulators 
intangible assets united s intangible assets consist principally of goodwill  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses  and core deposit intangibles 
united s goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
adverse changes in the economic environment  declining operations of acquired business units  or other factors could result in a decline of the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
these changes or factors  if they occur  could be material to united s operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
during the first quarter of  united updated its annual goodwill impairment assessment as a result of its stock price falling significantly below tangible book value 
as a result of the updated assessment  goodwill was found to be impaired and was written down to its estimated fair value 
the impairment charge of million was recognized as an expense in the first quarter of consolidated statement of income 
although conditions in the second quarter did not lead management to believe that further impairment existed  due to further weakness in united s loan portfolio and management s expectation for higher credit losses  goodwill was tested for impairment again in the third quarter of goodwill was found to have additional impairment resulting in a charge of million 
united performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of december  and no further impairment was identified 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could affect the recoverability of the intangible asset  such as loss of core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
these events or circumstances  if they occur  could be material to united s operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
income tax accounting income tax liabilities or assets are established for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are also established for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and deductions that can be carried forward used in future years 
the valuation of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is considered critical as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws 
the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
united believes its tax assets and liabilities are properly recorded for the respective periods in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   united had net deferred tax assets of million  including a valuation allowance of million related to state tax credits that are expected to expire unused 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
united s management considers both positive and negative evidence and analyzes changes in near term market conditions as well as other factors which may impact future operating results 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
at december   united s management believes that it is more likely than not that  with the exception of those state tax credits that are expected to expire unused due to a relatively short carryforward period of three years  it will be able to realize its deferred tax benefits through its ability to carry losses forward to future profitable years 
despite recent losses and the challenging economic environment  united has a history of strong earnings  is well capitalized  and has cautiously optimistic expectations regarding future taxable income 
the deferred tax assets are analyzed quarterly for changes affecting their ability to be realized  and there can be no guarantee that a valuation allowance will not be necessary in future periods 
regulatory risk based capital rules limit the amount of deferred tax assets that a bank or bank holding company can include in tier i capital 
generally  deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of such deferred tax assets that the bank expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on its projected future taxable income for that year or ii of the amount of the bank s tier capital 
at december   united had fully utilized its ability to carry losses back to open tax years 
therefore united s realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income 
accordingly  united has excluded the entire balance of its net deferred tax asset from tier i capital in calculating its risk based capital ratios 
in february of  the american recovery and reinvestment act amended the internal revenue code to allow eligible small businesses to carry back net operating losses nol s for a period of three  four or five years  instead of the usual two year limit 
in november of  the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act expanded this treatment to include nol s incurred in and allowed all businesses  not just eligible small businesses  to make the election 
however the election is not available to participants in the us treasury s capital purchase program  therefore united is not able to utilize this treatment 
mergers and acquisitions united selectively engages in the evaluation of strategic partnerships 
mergers and acquisitions present opportunities to enter new markets with an established presence and a capable management team already in place 
united employs certain criteria to ensure that any merger or acquisition candidate meets strategic growth and earnings objectives that will build future franchise value for shareholders 
additionally  the criteria include ensuring that management of a potential partner shares united s community banking philosophy of premium service quality and operates in attractive markets with excellent opportunities for further organic growth 
as part of this strategy  united completed one federally assisted acquisition in and one bank merger in united will continue to evaluate potential transactions as they are presented  including acquisitions of failed banks to the extent we are permitted to bid on them 
on june   united community bank ucb purchased substantially all the assets and assumed substantially all the liabilities of southern community bank scb from the federal deposit insurance corporation as receiver of scb 
scb operated five commercial banking branches on the south side of atlanta in fayetteville  peachtree city  locust grove and newnan  georgia 
the fdic took scb under receivership upon scb s closure by the georgia department of banking and finance at the close of business on june  the transaction resulted in a cash payment of million from the fdic to ucb 
further  ucb and the fdic entered into loss sharing agreements regarding future losses incurred on loans and foreclosed loan collateral existing at june  under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic will absorb percent of losses and share percent of loss recoveries on the first million of losses  and absorb percent of losses and share in percent of loss recoveries exceeding million 
the term for loss sharing on to family loans is ten years  while the term for loss sharing on all other loans is five years 
on june   united completed the acquisition of gwinnett commercial group  inc gwinnett  a bank holding company headquartered in lawrenceville  georgia  and its wholly owned subsidiary first bank of the south 
on june   gwinnett had assets totaling million  including purchase accounting related intangibles 
united exchanged  shares of its common stock valued at million and million in cash for all of the outstanding shares 
first bank of the south was merged into the bank and operates as a separate community bank  united community bank gwinnett 
non gaap financial measures this form k contains non gaap financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
such non gaap financial measures include  among others  the following operating revenue  operating expense  operating loss income  operating earnings loss per share and operating earnings loss per diluted share 
management uses these non gaap financial measures because it believes it is useful for evaluating our operations and performance over periods of time  as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our operations and performance 
management believes these non gaap financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies 
a reconciliation of these operating performance measures to gaap performance measures is included on the tables on pages and in  united recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million during the third and first quarters  respectively 
in addition  united recorded severance costs of million during the first quarter of and a gain on the acquisition of scb in the amount of million during the second quarter of in june  the north carolina attorney general appointed a receiver to take custody of the assets of the developers of two failed real estate developments near spruce pine  north carolina  citing possible fraud on the part of the developers 
united had loans to individual borrowers totaling million secured by undeveloped lots in these developments 
united was one of twelve banks that had loaned money to borrowers to finance the purchase of lots 
the loans were made to appropriately qualified borrowers in accordance with our standard underwriting procedures 
at the time the loans were made  we were not aware that most of the borrowers were simultaneously obtaining loans for additional lots at other banks and thereby taking on debt possibly beyond their repayment ability 
we were also unaware that the borrowers down payments were not paid in cash as indicated on the closing documents  but were financed by the developer and that the developer agreed to service the borrowers debts 
we also subsequently learned that the appraisals relied upon in the underwriting process had been inflated by using comparable sales that were not at arm s length to persons related to the developer and that many of the lots were subdivided into parcels that are too small to be used for their intended purpose 
united recognized a provision for fraud related loan losses of million in related to these loans and charged off an equal amount of loans 
the special provision reduced net income by million and reduced diluted earnings per share by in net operating income loss excludes the effect of the goodwill impairment charges of million  the million gain on acquisition  and the million in severance costs in  and the special million fraud related provision for loan losses in  because management believes that the circumstances leading to the provision and such charges and gains were isolated  non recurring events and do not reflect overall trends in united s earnings and financial performance 
management believes this non gaap net operating income loss provides users of united s financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing united s financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods

net interest revenue taxable equivalent net interest revenue the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities is the single largest component of united s revenue 
united actively manages this revenue source to provide an optimal level of revenue while balancing interest rate  credit  and liquidity risks 
net interest revenue totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the level recorded in net interest revenue for decreased million  or  from the level 
the increase in net interest revenue for was due primarily to improvement in the net interest margin resulting from management s focus on improving earnings performance 
the margin had been on a downward trend throughout as a result of many factors including the decrease in the prime interest rate  intensely competitive deposit pricing  efforts to build liquidity and a higher level of non performing assets 
deposit pricing competition began to ease late in the fourth quarter of  and united intensified its focus on loan pricing to ensure that it was being adequately compensated for the credit risk it was taking 
much of the improvement in loan pricing was due to united s ability to negotiate floors minimum interest rates into its floating rate loans 
the combined effect of easing deposit pricing and widening credit spreads in united s loan portfolio led to the basis point increase in the net interest margin from to the average yield on loans decreased basis points reflecting the falling prime lending rate on united s predominantly prime based loan portfolio and the higher level of non performing loans 
average loans decreased million in  or  from loan volume slowed substantially in and and continued into reflecting weakness in the housing market  particularly in the atlanta  georgia msa 
average interest earning assets for the year decreased million  or less than  from the decrease reflects the shrinking loan portfolio resulting from weak demand brought on by the recession and high unemployment 
the decrease in interest earning assets was more than offset by a million decrease in interest bearing liabilities from due to the rolling off of high cost deposits as funding needs softened 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was down from in  reflecting the effect of lower short term interest rates on united s prime based loans and increased levels of non performing loans 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest revenue  the interest rate spread and the net interest margin 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the effect of non interest bearing deposits and other non interest bearing funding sources and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company s investments  and is defined as net interest revenue as a percentage of total average interest earning assets which includes the positive effect of funding a portion of interest earning assets with customers non interest bearing deposits and with stockholders equity 
for  and  united s net interest spread was   and  respectively  while the net interest margin was   and  respectively 
both the net interest margin and net interest spread expanded in after falling in due to the aggressive competitive pricing for deposits  the effect of the federal reserve s action in lowering short term rates in on united s asset sensitive balance sheet  actions taken to build up liquidity with more expensive deposits  and due to the higher level of non performing assets 
during most of  there was aggressive competition for retail certificates of deposit cds  as banks competed for additional liquidity 
this competition kept retail cd rates relatively high while the prime rate was falling 
competition for liquidity sources eased in the fourth quarter of allowing united the ability to reduce deposit pricing while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
the combined effect of lower deposit pricing and wider credit spreads and floors on loans resulted in an improving net interest margin and net interest spread throughout the average rate on interest bearing liabilities for was  down from in  reflecting the effect of falling rates on united s floating rate liabilities and united s ability to reduce deposit pricing throughout the year

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio and corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan losses at quarter end 
the provision for loan losses was million in  compared with million in  and million in  which excludes the million special provision for fraud related loan losses 
as an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans  the provision was  and  respectively  in  and the amount of provision recorded in was the amount required such that the total allowance for loan losses reflected  in the estimation of management  the appropriate balance  and is appropriate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the increases in the provision and the allowance for loan losses over the last two years were due to an increase in substandard loans  deterioration in the collateral values leading to an expectation of higher charge offs upon default  further weakening of the residential construction and housing markets  and the recessionary economic environment 
the ratio of net loan charge offs to average outstanding loans for was  compared with for  and 
for  excluding the million in fraud related charge offs 
as the residential construction and housing markets have struggled  most notably in the atlanta msa  it has been difficult for many builders and developers to obtain cash flow from selling lots and houses needed to service debt 
this deterioration of the residential construction and housing market was the primary factor that resulted in higher credit losses and an increase in non performing assets 
although a majority of the loan charge offs have been within the residential construction and development portion of the portfolio in the atlanta  georgia msa  credit quality deterioration has migrated to other markets and loan categories 
additional discussion on credit quality and the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality and critical accounting polices sections of this report  as well as note to the consolidated financial statements

overdraft and non sufficient funds charges decreased million from this decrease was partially offset by an increase in atm and debit card fees of million from mortgage loan and related fees of million were up million  or  from the increase was due to a significant increase in the level of refinancing activity as mortgage rates fell to historical lows 
in  united closed  mortgage loans totaling million compared with  loans totaling million in substantially all these originated residential mortgages were sold into the secondary market  including the right to service the loans 
consulting fees of million increased  or  from the increase was primarily due to strengthening demand for regulatory consulting services as banks sought assistance in complying with regulatory sanctions 
during the last half of and the first quarter of  several consultants were engaged in an internal project to improve united s financial performance by assisting management in identifying revenue enhancement and cost savings opportunities 
this project allowed brintech to maintain the consultants productivity during a period of weak demand while providing a valuable service to united  however  these services did not result in the recognition of consolidated consulting fee revenue for financial reporting purposes since the services were performed by a wholly owned subsidiary 
brokerage fees decreased million  or  from the decrease in brokerage fees was due to weak market conditions 
additionally  a portion of united s brokerage fee revenue is derived from the value of assets under management which declined with the overall decline in the market  further contributing to the drop in transaction activity and revenue 
united incurred net securities gains of million and million during and  respectively  which resulted from balance sheet management activities 
the gains in were offset by losses from the prepayment of fhlb borrowings of million 
the net gains included million in impairment charges on equity and trust preferred securities investments in banks that failed during the year 
in  united sold mortgage backed securities in an effort to reposition the securities portfolio in anticipation of rising interest rates 
the proceeds from the sales were reinvested in us government agency bonds to avoid extension risk when interest rates rise 
other fee revenue of million increased  or  from the increase was due to higher earnings on deferred compensation plan assets 
the decrease of million from to was due to lower earnings on bank owned life insurance boli investments  lower earnings on deferred compensation plan assets and a lower earnings credit on float associated with official checks 
the decrease in boli earnings was due to poor performance in the underlying securities in which the cash surrender value had been invested 
the value of the underlying securities  which was comprised of a portfolio of mortgage backed securities  had depreciated significantly since their original purchase as demand for mortgage backed securities fell in the wake of the mortgage crisis 
early in the fourth quarter  united informed the carrier of its intent to surrender the policies  incurring a tax charge which is further described in the section titled income taxes on page of this report 
in the second quarter of  prior to the completion of the surrender transaction  united was able to negotiate acceptable terms with the insurance carrier and canceled the surrender transaction 
the million gain from the scb acquisition in was accounted for as a bargain purchase 
in this bargain purchase  the fair values of the net assets and liabilities received from the acquisition exceeded the purchase price of those assets and liabilities 
with the scb acquisition  united received assets  including a cash payment from the fdic  with an estimated fair value of million and liabilities with an estimated fair value of million 
the difference between the fair values of the assets received and liabilities assumed of million was recorded as a gain from the acquisition 
the fair values are preliminary and are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available 
changes to the closing date fair values will result in future adjustments to the gain from the acquisition 
operating expense operating expenses excluding non operating items were million in as compared to million in and million in non recurring charges in include million for goodwill impairment and million in severance costs 
including those non recurring charges  operating expenses for were million 
the following table presents the components of operating expenses

this affects year over year expense comparisons in the year an acquisition is completed and the year immediately following the acquisition 
salaries and employee benefits expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from as a result of united s reduction in workforce  employee salaries decreased approximately million from the decrease in employee salaries is after adding employees through the acquisition of scb in june of a decrease in group medical insurance costs resulting from the lower headcount and plan modifications contributed approximately million to the decrease 
through the reduction in workforce  united reduced headcount from  employees at december  to  at december   which excludes employees added through the second quarter of acquisition of scb 
offsetting the reduction in salaries expense and medical benefits expense was an increase of million in deferred compensation expense resulting from appreciation in the value of the underlying deferred compensation plan assets 
changes in the value of deferred compensation plan assets are offset in other fee revenue or other expense 
communication and equipment expense for was million  which was down  or  from united was able to keep expenses flat despite the additional expenses associated with the acquisition of scb due to upgrades in technology in previous years 
occupancy expense for was million  an increase of  or  from the majority of this increase was the result of higher insurance  utilities and maintenance charges and higher property taxes related to new banking facilities placed in service over the last months 
advertising and public relations expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from due to efforts to control discretionary spending and the discontinuance of united s refer a friend program in early postage  printing and supplies expense for was million  a decrease of million  or  from much of the decrease is due to lower postage charges resulting from concentrated efforts to have customers change to electronic statements and the discontinuance of a direct mail marketing campaign that had been in effect 
courier expense was also down from due to the use of remote deposit capture technology in branch locations to eliminate the need to courier items to be processed between branch locations and item processing centers 
professional fees were million for  an increase of million  or  from primarily due to higher legal costs associated with loan workouts and foreclosures 
foreclosed property expense for was million  an increase of million from foreclosed property expenses have remained elevated throughout the weak economic cycle 
this expense category includes legal fees  property taxes  marketing costs  utility services  maintenance and repair charges  as well as realized losses and write downs associated with foreclosed properties 
realized losses and write downs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for expenses related to foreclosed properties have risen with the increase in the number of foreclosed properties 
fdic assessments and other regulatory charges expense for was million  an increase of million from  reflecting an increase in fdic insurance premiums as well as a million provision for the special assessment charged to all depository institutions in in january of  the fdic began assessing deposit insurance premiums to re capitalize the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic allowed credits to those banks that had paid deposit insurance previously  which significantly reduced the amount of united s assessment 
for and  the deposit insurance assessment rates for banks in the lowest risk category ranged from basis points to basis points on deposit balances 
during  united s assessment was at the upper end of the range and beginning in the first quarter of  the fdic increased the rate by basis points 
in the fourth quarter of  the fdic announced that banks will be required to prepay deposit insurance premiums for the years through while this resulted in a million premium cash outlay in the fourth quarter  the expense will be recognized ratably over the next three years in the consolidated statement of income 
other expenses were million for  a decrease of million  or  from the decrease from was due the accrual of a million in the fourth quarter of for a disputed charge from the transfer of boli investments which was reversed in the second quarter of upon a settlement in united s favor 
income taxes income tax benefit was million in  compared to income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in the effective tax rates as a percentage of pre tax net income were   and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates were different from the statutory tax rates primarily due to interest revenue on certain investment securities and loans that are exempt from income taxes  tax exempt fee revenue  tax credits received on affordable housing investments  goodwill impairment charges and the change in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate for also reflects a decision made by management to reinstate certain boli policies which united had surrendered in the third quarter of united notified the carrier of its intent to surrender the policies in the fourth quarter of due to a dispute with the carrier 
the policies required a six month waiting period before the surrender became effective 
prior to the expiration of the six month waiting period  united and the carrier were able to reach an acceptable settlement of the dispute and the surrender transaction was terminated 
the tax charge recorded in was reversed during the second quarter of the effective tax rate for also reflects the tax treatment of the million goodwill impairment charge for the year 
the majority of united s goodwill originated from acquisitions that were treated as tax free exchanges  and therefore no tax deduction is allowed for a majority of the impairment charges 
the effective tax rate reflects a valuation allowance established for deferred tax assets 
management determined that it is more likely than not that approximately million  net of federal benefit  of state low income housing and business tax credits will expire unused due to a relatively short three and five year carry forward periods  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  united resolved a tax dispute with a state taxing authority relative to an issue identified during a routine audit 
united had fully reserved for the issue as an uncertain tax position 
the resolution resulted in the release of the reserve which increased the fourth quarter tax benefit by approximately million 
absent the goodwill impairment charges  the boli transactions  the settlement of the uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  united s effective tax rate for the year ended december   would have been approximately at december   united had net deferred tax assets of million  including a valuation allowance of million related to state tax credits that are expected to expire unused 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
united s management considers both positive and negative evidence and analyzes changes in near term market conditions as well as other factors which may impact future operating results 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
at december   united s management believes that it is more likely than not that  with the exception of the state tax credits that are expected to expire unused due to a relatively short carry forward periods of three to five years  it will be able to realize its deferred tax benefits through its ability to carry losses forward to future profitable years 
despite recent losses and the challenging economic environment  united has a history of strong earnings  is well capitalized  and has cautiously optimistic expectations regarding future taxable income 
the deferred tax assets are analyzed quarterly for changes affecting realizabilty  and there can be no guarantee that a valuation allowance will not be necessary in future periods 
additional information regarding income taxes  including a reconciliation of the differences between the recorded income tax provision and the amount of income tax computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fourth quarter discussion taxable equivalent net interest revenue for the fourth quarter of increased million  or  to million from the same period a year ago primarily due to lower deposit costs and wider credit spreads and floors in loans 
loans were down million during the fourth quarter of compared to the net interest margin increased basis points from the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of several factors led to the margin improvement including the easing of competitive pricing pressures on deposits and united s intensified focus on loan pricing to ensure adequate compensation for risk

non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   compared with at december  during the fourth quarter of  fee revenue of million increased million  or  from million for the fourth quarter of service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased  or  to million  primarily due to higher atm fees 
mortgage fees increased  or  to million due to an increase in refinancing activity as mortgage rates remained at historic lows 
united closed million in mortgage loans in the fourth quarter of  compared to million in the fourth quarter of consulting fees increased million from a year ago to million  reflecting an increased demand for regulatory compliance assistance 
consulting fees were low in the fourth quarter of due to the use of brintech consultants on internal projects that did not result in the recognition of revenue 
united recognized securities gains of million in the fourth quarter of  up million from the fourth quarter of the securities gains in were offset by losses of million from the prepayment of federal home loan bank advances 
operating expenses increased million to million  a increase from the fourth quarter of salaries and employee benefit costs of million increased million  or  from the fourth quarter of this increase was due to adjustments of million to reduce bonus expense and  to reduce deferred compensation expense in excluding the adjustments  salaries and benefits expense for the fourth quarter of was down million from the fourth quarter of due to the staff reduction 
communications and equipment expenses remained flat at million 
occupancy expense increased  to million due to higher depreciation and property taxes resulting from new locations 
professional fees increased  to million reflecting higher legal expenses associated with loan workouts and foreclosures 
postage  printing and supplies expense decreased  to million due to increased use of electronic statements and branch capture devices that reduced the need for couriers 
for the fourth quarter of  advertising and public relations expense decreased  or  reflecting a continued focus on controlling discretionary expenses 
foreclosed property expense of million increased million compared to million for the fourth quarter of  due to additional losses on sales and write downs taken to accelerate the disposition of properties and higher expenses due to the increase in the number of properties 
fdic insurance premiums increased from million during the fourth quarter of to million for the same period in  due to an increase in the fdic insurance assessment rate 
other operating expense decreased million to million primarily due to a million disputed charge from the transfer of boli assets that was recorded in the fourth quarter of this accrual was reversed during the second quarter of  as the charge was settled in united s favor 
balance sheet review total assets at december  were billion  a decrease of million  or  from december  on an average basis  total assets decreased million  or less than  from to average interest earning assets for and were billion for each period

the decrease results from weak loan demand within united s market and management s efforts to reduce united s residential construction concentration 
at december   total loans were billion  a decrease of million  or  from december  the rate of loan growth began to decline in the first quarter of  and  except for commercial loans secured by real estate  the balances have continued to decline through and the decrease in the loan portfolio was primarily due to deterioration in the residential construction and housing markets and management s focus to reduce exposures in both residential and commercial construction loans 
this deterioration resulted in part in an oversupply of lot inventory  houses and land within united s markets  which further slowed construction activities and acquisition and development projects 
to date  the decline in the housing market has been most severe in the atlanta  georgia msa  although there has been migration of deterioration into united s other markets

additional information on united s loan administration function is included in item under the heading loan review and non performing assets 
united classifies performing loans as substandard when there is a well defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment by the borrower and there is a distinct possibility that united could sustain some loss if the deficiency is not corrected

by re commercial construction commercial industrial total commercial residential construction residential mortgage installment total at december   performing substandard loans totaled million and increased million from december  residential construction loans  particularly in atlanta  have represented the largest proportion of both performing substandard and nonperforming loans 
the increase in substandard residential mortgages is primarily related to rising unemployment rates 
the increase in substandard commercial loans reflects the recessionary economic environment 
reviews of substandard performing and non performing loans  past due loans and larger credits  are conducted on a regular basis with management and are designed to identify risk migration and potential charges to the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews are performed by the lending officers and the loan review department  and also consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  past loan loss experience  anticipated loan losses  changes in risk profile  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
united also uses external loan review to complement the efforts of united s internal loan review and to enhance the independence of the loan review process 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical data  subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in united s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consequently  management believes that the unallocated allowance appropriately reflects probable inherent but undetected losses in the loan portfolio 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each of the past five years

excludes loans acquired through the fdic assisted acquisition of southern community bank that are covered by loss sharing agreements 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings was based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the amount each year is dependent upon many factors including growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  net charge offs  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral  and other macro economic factors and trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed quarterly by management through an analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
the increases in the provision and the allowance for loan losses compared to a year ago were due to increasing trends in substandard loans  deterioration in the collateral values leading to an expectation of higher charge offs upon default  further weakening of the residential construction and housing markets  and the recessionary economic environment 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  reflects the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require adjustments to the provision for loan losses in future periods if  in their opinion  the results of their review warrant such additions 
see the critical accounting policies section for additional information on the allowance for loan losses

non performing assets  which include non performing loans and foreclosed property  totaled million at december   compared with million at december  united s position throughout the recession has been to actively and aggressively work to dispose of problem assets quickly 
united s policy is to place loans on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the principal and interest on a loan is not likely to be repaid in accordance with the loan terms or when the loan becomes days past due and is not both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest revenue 
interest payments received on non accrual loans are applied as a reduction of principal 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were on non accrual status at december   although in certain isolated cases  united executed forbearance agreements whereby united will continue to fund construction loans to completion as long as the borrower meets the conditions of the forbearance agreement 
the table below summarizes non performing assets at year end for the last five years 
it excludes assets acquired in that are covered by the loss sharing agreement with the fdic

foreclosed property is initially recorded at fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
if the fair value  less estimated costs to sell at the time of foreclosure  is less than the loan balance  the deficiency is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
if the fair value  less estimated costs to sell  of the foreclosed property decreases during the holding period  a valuation allowance is established with a charge to foreclosed property costs

investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects united s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue 
the securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale decreased million from the end of united continued to purchase securities throughout  primarily to reinvest the proceeds of maturing securities

table carrying value of investment securities as of december  in thousands securities available for sale us government agencies state and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities other total securities available for sale the investment securities portfolio primarily consists of us government sponsored agency mortgage backed securities  non agency mortgage backed securities  us government agency securities and municipal securities 
mortgage backed securities rely on the underlying pools of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow of principal and interest 
the actual maturities of these securities will differ from the contractual maturities because the loans underlying the security may prepay without prepayment penalties 
decreases in interest rates will generally cause an acceleration of prepayment levels 
in a declining interest rate environment  united may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from these prepayments in assets that have comparable yields 
in a rising rate environment  the opposite occurs 
prepayments tend to slow and the weighted average life extends 
this is referred to as extension risk  which can lead to lower levels of liquidity due to the delay of cash receipts  and can result in the holding of an asset that yields a below market rate for a longer period of time 
at december   united had of its total investment securities portfolio in mortgage backed securities  compared with at december  due to a lack of loan demand  united continued to purchase additional mortgage backed securities in order to obtain a favorable yield with low risk 
in late  united began to shift away from mortgage backed securities to avoid extension risk in the event that rates begin to rise 
united did not have securities of any issuer in excess of of equity at year end or  excluding us government issues

goodwill and other intangible assets united s goodwill represents the premium paid for acquired companies above the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including separately identifiable intangible assets 
united evaluates its goodwill annually  or more frequently if necessary  to determine if any impairment exists 
united performed its annual assessment as of december  united engaged the services of a national third party valuation expert who employed commonly used valuation techniques including an earnings approach that considered discounted future expected cash earnings and two market approaches 
the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december  did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment 
during the first quarter of  united s stock price fell from per share at december   to a low of per share  and ended the first quarter of at 
management believed this fall in stock price reflected uncertainty about the economic cycle 
additionally  the stock prices of the peer group used as part of the valuation analysis in the year end goodwill impairment assessment experienced similar declines 
the current economic environment has resulted in lower earnings with higher credit costs and those costs have been reflected in the income statement  as well as valuation adjustments to loan balances through increases to the allowance for loan losses 
with the stock price trading at a significant discount to book value and tangible book value  in addition to those other factors  management believed that goodwill should be reassessed for impairment in the first quarter of as a result of this assessment  united recognized a goodwill impairment charge to earnings in the amount of million during the first quarter of conditions in the second quarter of did not lead management to believe that further impairment existed at the time 
united s financial condition continued to deteriorate and our credit losses continued to mount into the third quarter of although some credit deterioration was expected at the time the first quarter impairment assessment was performed  conditions continued to weaken beyond earlier expectations and the rising level of nonperforming loans and credit losses led management to believe that further impairment could exist  and that another interim test was warranted for the third quarter of united recognized an additional goodwill impairment charge of million as a result of additional testing 
in performing the first and third quarter impairment assessments  united engaged the same third party valuation firm used to assist with the annual goodwill impairment assessment 
the two interim assessments and the annual assessment at december   were performed using a consistent approach with the annual assessment done as of december  the first step step of the goodwill impairment analysis was to determine whether the fair value of united exceeded the book value of equity  which would imply that goodwill was not impaired 
the step analysis included three commonly used valuation techniques  including an earnings approach that considered discounted expected future cash earnings and two market approaches 
the first market approach was the guideline public companies method that considered united s implied value by comparing united to a select peer group of public companies and their current market valuation 
the second market approach was the merger and acquisition method that considered the amount an acquiring company might be willing to pay to gain control of united  based on recent merger and acquisition activity 
all three valuation techniques used in step of the interim and annual assessments in indicated a decline in value from the december  assessment  due to deteriorating market conditions in the financial services industry and a decline in united s internal earnings forecast related to further credit quality weakness 
the step analysis performed in the first and third quarters and at year end indicated that the estimated fair value of united had fallen below its book value 
the declining valuation determined in step led to step of the goodwill impairment assessment  which required united to determine the fair value of all its assets and liabilities  including separately identifiable intangible assets  and to determine the implied value of goodwill as the difference between the value of united determined in step and the value of the underlying assets and liabilities determined in step there are a number of valuation assumptions required to determine the value of our assets and liabilities 
the most significant assumption in determining the estimated fair value of united as a whole and the amount of any resulting impairment was the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows valuation method 
for the december  assessment  the discount rate selected was which considered a risk free rate of return that was adjusted for the industry median beta  equity risk and size premiums  and a company specific risk premium 
the discount rate used for the two interim assessments was 
the increase in the discount rate used for the annual assessment was due to a higher long term risk free rate which was used to determine the discount rate 
an increase in the discount rate of one percentage point would result in the decrease in the estimated value of united of approximately million 
this would have indicated approximately million in goodwill impairment 
a decrease of one percentage point would result in an increase in the estimated value of united of approximately million 
other significant assumptions relate to the value of the loan portfolio 
those assumptions included estimates of cash flows on nonperforming loans a probability of default rates and loss on default rates for performing loans 
changes in those assumptions  or any other significant assumptions  could have a significant impact on the results of the goodwill impairment assessment could result in future impairment charges 
events and conditions that could lead to further goodwill impairment include  among other things  changes in the long term risk free interest rate or any of the risk premium assumptions used to compile the overall discount rate for the discounted cash flows valuation method used in step  changes in stock price valuations for united or the selected per group of banks used to determine united s value under the guideline public companies method  or further deterioration in united s financial performance or outlook for future financial performance 
because goodwill is an intangible asset that cannot be sold separately or otherwise disposed of  it is not recognized in determining capital adequacy for regulatory purposes 
therefore  the goodwill impairment charges taken during had no effect on united s regulatory capital ratios 
other intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles representing the value of united s acquired deposit base  are amortizing intangible assets that are required to be tested for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
there were no events or circumstances that lead management to believe that any impairment exists in united s other intangible assets 
deposits total average deposits for were billion  an increase of million  or  from average non interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased million  or  and average now accounts decreased million  or  from average time deposits for were billion  up from billion in at december   total deposits were billion compared with billion at the end of  a decrease of million  or 
in  in an effort to increase liquidity  the bank began competing for cds  despite the aggressive market 
during the second and third quarters of  united raised more than million in month certificates as part of a special rate offer 
most of those certificates of deposit matured in the third quarter of  and united did not offer a special rate upon their maturity 
approximately half of the certificates of deposit that were part of the rate special  were renewed at standard rates in effect at the time of renewal 
the other half left the bank  accounting for most of the decline in the balance 
united lowered its rates on non special certificates during  allowing the balances to decline due to weak loan demand 
brokered deposits at december  were million compared with million at december  the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of time deposits of  and greater and brokered time deposits

through this affiliation  secured advances totaling million were outstanding at december   at rates competitive with time deposits of like maturities 
united anticipates continued use of this short and long term source of funds 
the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had both fixed and floating interest rates ranging up to 
approximately of the fhlb advances mature prior to december  additional information regarding fhlb advances  including scheduled maturities  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   united had million in federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  and other short term borrowings outstanding  compared to million outstanding at december  united takes advantage of these additional sources of liquidity when rates are favorable compared to other forms of short term borrowings  such as fhlb advances and brokered deposits 
liquidity management liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining united s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet ongoing operational cash needs and to take advantage of revenue producing opportunities as they arise 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors  it is the primary goal of united to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in both normal operating conditions and in periods of market or industry stress 
because united is a separate entity and apart from the bank  it must provide for its own liquidity 
united is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common and preferred shareholders  and interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities 
substantially all of united s liquidity is obtained from subsidiary service fees and dividends from the bank  which is limited by applicable law 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  to optimize interest revenue 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both objectives 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan sales and repayments and the maturities and sales of securities  as well as the ability to use these as collateral for borrowings on a secured basis 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to billion  or  of the loan portfolio at december  in addition  at december   united had million in commercial paper investments that mature within days 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through the stability of deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  brokered deposits  federal reserve discount window borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional wholesale sources of liquidity and represent united s additional borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs 
the table below presents a summary of united s short term borrowings over the last three years 
table short term borrowings as of december  in thousands december  period end balance period end weighted average interest rate maximum outstanding at any month end average amounts outstanding during the year weighted average rate for the year federal funds purchased repurchase agreements other december  federal funds purchased line of credit repurchase agreements other december  federal funds purchased line of credit repurchase agreements other at december   united had sufficient qualifying collateral to increase fhlb advances by million and federal reserve discount window capacity of million 
united s internal policy limits brokered deposits to of total assets 
at december   united had the capacity to increase brokered deposits by billion and still remain within this limit 
in addition to these wholesale sources  united has the ability to attract retail deposits at any time by competing more aggressively on pricing 
the following table shows united s contractual obligations and other commitments 
table contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  in thousands maturity by years total or less to to over contractual cash obligations fhlb advances long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commitments lines of credit commercial letters of credit uncertain tax positions total other commitments as disclosed in united s consolidated statement of cash flows  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  the major sources of cash provided by operating activities were noncash expenses of depreciation  amortization and accretion  provision for loan losses  goodwill impairment and stock based compensation which totaled million  and more than offset uses of cash that included the net loss of million and a deferred income tax benefit of million 
net cash provided by investing activities of million consisted primarily of a decrease in loans of million and the purchase of million of available for sale securities  offset by the maturity  call or sale of billion of available for sale securities 
in addition  the company received million related to the acquisition of scb  as well as million in proceeds from the sale of foreclosed property 
the million of net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of a net decrease in deposits of million offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
the decrease in deposits was primarily in certificates of deposit as united allowed attrition in these higher priced funds by not competing aggressively with rates 
in addition  there was a net decrease in short term borrowings of million and a net repayment in fhlb advances of million 
in the opinion of management  united s liquidity position at december  is sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued to local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
united uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees as for underwriting on balance sheet instruments 
united evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of the collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amount of these instruments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments expire without being used 
united is not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments  or that could significantly affect earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off balance sheet arrangements 
capital resources and dividends shareholders equity at december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from december  the common stock sold late in the third quarter of resulted in an increase in shareholder s equity of million 
this was offset by the net loss of million  which included non cash goodwill impairment charges of million which have no impact on regulatory capital 
accumulated other comprehensive income  which includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and the unrealized gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  is excluded in the calculation of regulatory capital ratios 
excluding the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income  shareholders equity decreased million  or 
in order to preserve capital  united suspended its cash dividend in the third quarter of and declared a stock dividend of new share for every shares held in the third and fourth quarters of and each of the first three quarters of united reported million in dividends on series a and series b preferred stock  for the year ended december  compared to  for united recognizes that cash dividends are an important component of shareholder value  and therefore  we intend to provide for cash dividends on common stock when earnings  capital levels and other factors permit 
the federal reserve has issued guidelines for the implementation of risk based capital requirements by us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
however  to be considered well capitalized under the guidelines  a total risk based capital ratio is required  of which must be tier capital 
tier i capital consists of shareholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income  intangible assets goodwill and deposit based intangibles  and disallowed deferred tax assets  plus qualifying capital securities 
united s tier i capital totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include supplemental capital such as the qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier i capital plus tier ii capital is referred to as total risk based capital and was million at december  the ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  on december   united participated in treasury s cpp by selling  shares of series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares  shares  as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a reduction following united s recent stock offering of united s common stock to treasury 
the proceeds of million were allocated between the series b preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values at the time of the sale 
of the million in proceeds  million was allocated to the series b preferred stock and million was allocated to the warrant 
the discount recorded on the series b preferred stock that resulted from allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrant is being accreted directly to into retained earnings over a five year period applying a level yield 
the exercise price of the warrant is per share per share  as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and is exercisable at any time on or before december  the series b preferred stock qualifies as tier i capital under risk based capital guidelines and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
the series b preferred stock may be redeemed after december  at the stated amount of  per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
prior to december   the series b preferred stock may be redeemed only with proceeds from the sale of qualifying equity securities 
the series b preferred stock is non voting except for class voting rights on matters that would adversely affect the rights of the holders of the series b preferred stock 
on october   united s subsidiaries united community statutory trust ii and united community statutory trust iii issued trust preferred securities through a private placement 
united community statutory trust ii  which pays interest at a fixed rate of  issued million in trust preferred securities and  in common securities 
united community statutory trust iii  which pays interest at a variable rate of prime plus  issued million in trust preferred securities and  in common securities 
united purchased all of the common securities issued by each trust and received the proceeds from the sale of the common and trust preferred securities by entering into a junior subordinated debenture agreement with the trusts 
the junior subordinated debentures have terms that match the terms of the trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities mature on october  and are callable any time after october  at par 
the trust preferred securities were issued with warrants that allow the holder to redeem the trust preferred securities for united s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants can be exercised at any time prior to october   at which time the warrants expire 
the proceeds of the issuance of the trust preferred securities were allocated between the trust preferred securities and the warrants based on their relative fair values on the date of issuance 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier i capital under risk based capital guidelines 
united has other outstanding junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities totaling million at december  the related trust preferred securities of million excluding common securities qualify as tier i capital under risk based capital guidelines provided that total trust preferred securities do not exceed certain quantitative limits 
at december   all of united s trust preferred securities qualified as tier i capital 
further information on united s trust preferred securities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the bank issued a million subordinated variable rate note  due august  the subordinated note qualifies as tier ii capital under risk based capital guidelines 
the note bears interest at a rate of three month libor 
the note is callable at par at any time 
the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
of the million in subordinated debt that united had outstanding at december   million qualified at tier ii capital under risk based capital guidelines 
late in the third quarter of  united issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
this increased shareholders equity by million  after payment of issuance costs 
the proceeds from the stock issuance were immediately invested in united s wholly owned bank subsidiary  united community bank 
a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier i capital divided by quarterly average assets reduced by the amount of goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs  but the federal reserve requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve 
the federal reserve uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
management believes that united s capital must be well above the minimum capital requirements to maintain its business plan 
united s leverage ratio at december  was 
the following table shows united s capital ratios  as calculated under regulatory guidelines  at december  and table capital ratios dollars in thousands united community banks  inc consolidated united community bank regulatory guidelines well as of december  as of december  minimum capitalized risk based ratios tier i capital total capital leverage ratio tier i capital total capital united monitors these capital ratios to ensure that united and the bank remain within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios of united and the bank is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effect of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a general business corporation in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important effect on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than nominal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
united s management believes the effect of inflation on financial results depends on united s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary effect on performance 
united has an asset liability management program to monitor and manage united s interest rate sensitivity position 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity management the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant effect on united s profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates  in order to achieve united s overall financial goals 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
united s net interest revenue  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
united manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the alco 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing united s interest rate sensitivity 
one of the tools management uses to estimate the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changes in interest rates is an asset liability simulation model 
resulting estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  loan and deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
alco regularly reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations  however  actual net interest revenue may differ from model results 
the primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over a twelve month period under multiple interest rate scenarios 
the base scenario assumes rates remain flat over the next twelve months and is the scenario to which all others are compared to in order to measure the change in net interest revenue 
gradual rising and falling rate scenarios are compared to this base scenario 
another commonly analyzed scenario is a most likely scenario that projects the most likely change in rates over the next twelve months based on the slope of the yield curve 
other scenarios analyzed may include rate shocks  narrowing or widening spreads  and yield curve steepening or flattening 
longer time horizons are also modeled 
united s policy is based on the month impact on net interest revenue of interest rate ramps that increase basis points and decrease basis points from the base scenario 
in the ramp scenarios  rates change basis points per month over the initial eight months 
the policy limits the change in net interest revenue over months to a decrease in either scenario 
the policy ramp and base scenarios assume a static balance sheet 
historically low rates on december  made use of the down basis point scenario problematic 
at december  united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue over the next twelve months and a basis point decrease in rates would cause an approximate 
increase in net interest revenue over the next twelve months 
at december   united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate decrease in net interest revenue 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate changes on net interest revenue 
united may have some discretion in the extent and timing of deposit repricing depending upon the competitive pressures in the markets in which it operates 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly even when the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  due to the two instruments repricing according to different indices 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
these prepayments may have significant effect on the net interest margin 
because of these limitations  an interest sensitivity gap analysis alone generally does not provide an accurate assessment of exposure to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the contractual maturity of investment securities by maturity date and average yields based on amortized cost for all obligations on a fully taxable basis 
the composition and maturity repricing distribution of the securities portfolio is subject to change depending on rate sensitivity  capital and liquidity needs 
table expected maturity of available for sale investment securities as of december  in thousands maturity by years or less to to over total us government agencies state and political subdivisions other securities total securities available for sale weighted average yield includes mortgage backed securities based on amortized cost  taxable equivalent basis in order to assist in achieving a desired level of interest rate sensitivity  united has entered into off balance sheet contracts that are considered derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments can be a cost effective and capital effective means of modifying the repricing characteristics of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
these contracts consist of interest rate swaps under which united pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate and interest rate floor contracts in which united pays a premium to a counterparty who agrees to pay united the difference between a variable rate and a strike rate if the variable rate falls below the strike rate 
united s derivative financial instruments are classified as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
the changes in fair value of derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income from which amounts are reclassified into interest income over time as the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
fair value hedges recognize currently in earnings both the effect of the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the offsetting effect of the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability 
at december  united had interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of million that were designated as cash flow hedges of prime based loans 
united had interest rate floor contracts with a total notional amount of million that were also designated as cash flow hedges of prime based loans 
at december   united had receive fixed  pay libor swap contracts with a total notional amount of million that were accounted for as fair value hedges of brokered deposits 
from time to time  united will terminate swap or floor positions when conditions change and the position is no longer necessary to manage united s overall sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
in those situations where the terminated swap or floor was in an effective hedging relationship at the time of termination and the hedging relationship is expected to remain effective throughout the original term of the swap or floor  the resulting gain or loss is amortized over the remaining life of the original contract 
for swap contracts  the gain or loss is amortized over the remaining original contract term using the straight line method of amortization 
for floor contracts  the gain or loss is amortized over the remaining original contract term based on the original floorlet schedule 
at december   united had million in gains from terminated derivative positions included in other comprehensive income that will be amortized into earnings over their remaining original contract terms 
united s policy requires all derivative financial instruments be used only for asset liability management through the hedging of specific transactions or positions  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
management believes that the risk associated with using derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk sensitivity is minimal and should not have any material unintended effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in order to mitigate potential credit risk  from time to time united may require the counterparties to derivative contracts to pledge securities as collateral to cover the net exposure
