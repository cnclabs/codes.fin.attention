item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management discussion and analysis md a together with the risk factors set forth in item a  and with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview applied energetics is a leader in the development and manufacture of applied energy systems for military and commercial applications 
through our efforts in developing our core technology  laser guided energy lge  we have gained expertise and proprietary knowledge in high performance lasers  high voltage electronics  advanced dynamic optics and atmospheric and plasma interactions 
we apply these technologies to deliver innovative solutions to urgent military requirements  including neutralizing improvised explosive devices ieds and other high priority missions of us and allied military forces 
additionally  we develop and manufacture high voltage and laser products for government and commercial customers for a range of applications 
applied energetics was founded on the premise that an entrepreneurial approach to technology development would accelerate the advancement of laser guided energy lge to solve critical needs in the directed energy weapon arena 
we have developed an effective and robust counter ied technology as a result of our research and development 
lgetm and lipc technologies applied energetics is the developer of lge and laser induced plasma channel lipc technologies 
these revolutionary technologies can precisely deliver high voltage electrical charges by using a laser to create a conductive path in the atmosphere 
we are developing applications that can deliver tailored weapon and countermeasure effects to targets with laser accuracy  and with manageable effects to reduce the potential for inadvertent injury and minimize collateral damage 
this technology has been in development since our inception in  and we have protected what we believe to be the enabling intellectual property through us patent filings 
lge development has been funded through multiple department of defense contracts in support of us navy  army  air force  and the office of secretary of defense programs as well as through internally funded research initiatives 
on august   we received a million contract from the us army s research  development and engineering command for the continued advancement and development of our lge technology 
the contract is for a period of three years  with a potential contract ceiling of million 
counter ied technologies working with the united states marine corps  we have developed and delivered a system that demonstrates significant capability in countering ieds  a major threat to military operations throughout the world 
technical and field results of such cied technologies are highly sensitive or classified  but we are satisfied that our technology has performed well in addressing this critical mission 
we have integrated our cied technologies into military vehicles 
we anticipate additional product variations may be utilized on other military platforms in the future as military customers identify new mission areas for implementation of our technologies 
we continue to work actively with our customers to field these innovative cied technologies 
during  our focus was on completing work on a million contract  which included additional funding through contract modifications for our us marine corps program for approximately  of which  was received in september 
additionally  we received  in continued funding in november of to support further development and operational assessment of the technology 
in january  we received a million contract increase to continue further operational assessment of the technology  develop additional systems  provide training and field support for systems  develop a smaller version of the technology for installation on other us marine corps and us army vehicles and platforms  and to upgrade the engineering documentation of the system to facilitate future transition to low rate initial production 
our counter ied technology continues to perform well and has received favorable evaluations by the us marine corps 
the delivery and successful employment of this technology by a customer in a rugged field environment is an important milestone for applied energetics  as we believe it validates our ability to transition technologies from the laboratory to the field and provide customer support throughout the product life cycle 
in late january  the commanding general of the marine corps systems command mcsc made the decision to begin transitioning this program from the marine corps warfighting laboratory to mcsc for program oversight and further development 
applied energetics was informed that its technology would become part of an existing program of record for ground support equipment for combat engineers within the marine corps 
this group is responsible for counter ied operations for the marines 
this decision is another significant milestone for the company  as this transition is the first indication that one of our technologies is expected to be produced for regular military procurement as opposed to developmental activities 
furthermore  we believe that the acceptance of this technology by a military customer will have a positive effect on development activities for lge for use of that technology for additional counter ied missions 
in preparation for the transition of our counter ied technology to regular production  applied energetics has entered into discussions with large defense contractors to investigate teaming agreements or other arrangements to enable us to rapidly increase production rates while focusing on the areas that are within our core areas of expertise 
such arrangements would take advantage of the scale and resources that these organizations possess  along with their considerable experience and reputation in delivering certified products to military customers 
it is expected that applied energetics would maintain the position of prime contractor for these future production contractors  with the other organizations acting as subcontractors within their areas of expertise 
high voltage technologies since the company s inception  it has acquired and developed unique high voltage capabilities 
operating within the company is a group focused on providing customized high voltage solutions for semiconductor  aerospace  chemical processing  and other military and commercial activities 
opportunities currently in process or under development include advanced electron beam technologies  nested high voltage generators and other unique power solutions for a wide range of applications 
during  we delivered several high voltage products to commercial customers 
we also received an order for development of an electron beam system that uses our nested high voltage generator as a power source for delivery in the second quarter of while the dollar value of these contracts are relatively small compared to the multi million dollar government contracts for counter ied and lge  we believe that these continuing orders will allow us to build expertise and markets within the commercial sector for our high voltage technologies and systems 
laser technologies the company has the capability to design and build rugged solid state lasers and unique laser components for military and commercial applications 
the company has the expertise to build very unique  rugged ultra short pulse lasers for key applications 
on july   we received a  contract for the design  development and delivery of a laser system to the us navy 
emerging markets and applications in the third quarter of  we initiated a new strategic plan 
the objective of this effort was to identify the areas in which our core strengths can be developed to increase our business across new applications in the military  government and commercial sectors 
the goals for the strategic plan include increasing revenues  achieving positive cash flow  profitability  development of new products and markets  and controlling costs to improve margins 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its assumptions on historical experiences and on various other inputs and estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in addition  management considers the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
significant estimates include revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  estimate to forecast loss on contracts under the completed contract method of accounting  the valuation of inventory  estimates of long lived asset value  and estimate to forecast expected forfeiture rate on stock based compensation and stock based compensation expense 
revenue recognition revenue has been derived from ongoing contract work for systems development  effects testing and the design and development of demonstration systems and sub systems for our government and commercial customers 
this work is expected to be generally performed under cost plus contracts with government customers 
revenue under long term government contracts is generally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
revenue  billable monthly  under cost plus fixed fee contracts is recorded as costs are incurred and includes estimated earned fees in the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs 
costs include direct labor  direct materials  subcontractor costs and overhead 
general and administrative expenses allowable under the terms of the contracts are allocated per contract depending on its direct labor and material proportion to total direct labor and material of all contracts 
as contracts can extend over one or more accounting periods  revisions in earnings estimated during the course of work are reflected during the accounting period in which the facts become known 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period in which the facts become known 
management evaluates many variables and makes various assumptions related to the estimation of total cost of completion of long term contracts 
management reviews the progress and performance of all contracts monthly 
the asset caption accounts receivable includes costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  which represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
such revenue is billable under the terms of the contracts at the end of the year  yet was not invoiced until january   and is generally expected to be collected within one year 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenue recognized 
revenue for other products and services is recognized when such products and services are delivered or performed and  in connection with certain sales to certain customers  when the products and services are accepted  which is normally negotiated as part of the initial contract 
revenue from commercial  non governmental customers has historically been based on fixed price contracts where the sale is recognized upon acceptance of the product or performance of the service and when payment is probable under the completed contract method of accounting 
contract costs are accumulated in the same manner as inventory costs and are charged to operations as the related revenue from contract is recognized 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period in which the facts become known 
inventories inventories include material  direct labor and related manufacturing administrative overhead and are stated at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis or market for raw materials and work in process inventory 
when actual contract cost and the estimate to complete exceed the estimated contract revenues  a loss provision is recorded 
due to the nature of our inventory  we analyze inventory on an item by item basis compared to future usage and sales for obsolescence quarterly 
share based payments stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
we make the following assumptions relative to this model i the annual dividend yield is zero as we do not pay dividends  ii the weighted average expected life is based on historical share option exercises  pre and post vesting terminations and share option term expiration  iii the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury security rate for the expected life  and iv the volatility is based on the level of fluctuations in our historical share price for a period equal to the weighted average expected life 
we estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and adjust this estimate over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative adjustment  which is recognized in the period of change and which impacts the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
results of operations our consolidated financial information for the years ending december   and is as follows revenue cost of revenue general and administrative settlement expenses selling and marketing research and development other expense income interest expense interest income other income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss revenue revenue decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to our counter ied revenue decreased by million to million in due to revenues being derived mostly from operational support and testing of our counter ied systems compared to manufacturing of counter ied systems and spares in lge revenues decreased by million to million in mostly attributable to ending of certain lge contracts in the first half of and then increasing in the second half of with the announcement of two new contracts 
high voltage revenue decreased by million in to  due to reduced hardware sales in the commercial markets 
laser revenues  a new product line  increased by cost of revenue cost of revenue includes manufacturing labor  benefits and overhead  and an allocation of allowable general and administration and research and development costs in accordance with the terms of our government contracts 
cost of revenue for decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in cost of revenue directly tied to the decrease in sales activity  and to a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of million and loss provisions of approximately million that occurred in by product line  counter ied costs decreased by approximately million  lge costs decreased by approximately million  high voltage costs decreased by million  and were offset by an increase in laser costs of approximately million 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in g a expenses was primarily driven by the decision to right size the company in terms of both employees and cost reduction initiatives based on a shortfall of revenue  which became evident in the second quarter of salaries and wages decreased by approximately million  non cash compensation costs decreased by approximately million  supplies and building related expenses decreased by approximately  travel expenses decreased by approximately  relocation expenses decreased by approximately  depreciation expenses decreased by approximately  and professional services decreased by  the decreases in expenses were offset by a decrease in applied labor  overhead and material handling costs allocated to cost of revenue of approximately million and to asset disposals associated with leasehold improvement of approximately  at december   there were approximately  of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested restricted stock awards  net of estimated forfeitures and approximately  of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options  net of estimated forfeitures 
these costs are expected to be recognized on a weighted average basis over periods of approximately one year for restricted stock awards and two years for unvested stock options 
litigation settlement litigation settlement expenses for were approximately million 
this includes the fair value of the  shares issued in settlement of the class action lawsuit filed by george wood and raymond deedon  and the derivative action filed by john t 
johnasen on september   and the legal fees not covered by insurance proceeds 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the increase was mostly due to increases in labor allocation and travel related to business development  and bids and proposals activities that enabled new contracts aggregating approximately million for tied to lge contracts and a million contract received in january research and development research and development expenses decreased approximately  for the year ended december  compared to our internal research and development costs involve experimentation  design  development and enhancement of proprietary technologies and new products 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of interest income and interest expense 
net interest income for was lower by approximately  from primarily due to the lower balance of invested funds and lower interest rates in net loss our operations in resulted in a net loss of approximately million  an increase of approximately  when compared to the approximately million net loss for our net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share basic and diluted decreased from per share to per share  partially due to the increased number of shares outstanding in inflation and seasonality we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on the operations or financial condition of our business  nor do we believe that we are subject to significant seasonal swings in our business 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  and  in a certificate of deposit 
in  we used approximately million of cash in operating activities 
this amount is comprised primarily of our net loss of approximately million  increases in inventories of  due to a new contract  and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of approximately  offsetting these amounts were non cash stock option compensation expense of approximately million  a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million  litigation costs paid in common stock of approximately million and depreciation and amortization of approximately  also in  investing activities used approximately  and financing activities used approximately  we anticipate that short term and long term funding needs will be provided from the cash flow from servicing our government contracts 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital to fulfill existing contracts and expected contracts in and into the government contracts  that presently represent a major portion of our current activity  are on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
this means all work performed is done at our government approved rates  which include general and administrative costs  overhead  labor and materials  fees and profit 
these costs are accrued as incurred and billed monthly 
backlog at december  and  respectively  we had a backlog ie work load remaining on signed contracts of approximately million  and million  respectively  to be completed within the twelve months following those dates 
as of february   our backlog was million 
operating leases we generally operate in leased premises under operating leases that have options permitting renewals for additional periods 
total rent expense on premises amounted to approximately  and  for and  respectively 
in february  we purchased our principal office  manufacturing  storage  and primary research and development facility in tucson  arizona for approximately million 
preferred stock the series a preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share 
the series a preferred stock bears dividends at the rate of of the liquidation preference per share per annum  which accrues from the date of issuance  and is payable quarterly  when declared 
dividends are payable in i cash  ii shares of our common stock valued for such purpose at of the weighted average of the last sales prices of our common stock for each of the trading days in the ten trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the applicable dividend payment date  provided that the issuance and or resale of all such shares of our common stock are then covered by an effective registration statement or iii any combination of the foregoing 
as of december   there were  shares of series a preferred stock outstanding
