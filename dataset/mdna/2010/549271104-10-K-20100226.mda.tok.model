historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated financial statements  including trends that might appear  should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those described under the section cautionary statements for safe harbor purposes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview general we are an innovative specialty chemical company that produces and supplies technologies that improve the quality  value and performance of our customers products in the global transportation  industrial and consumer markets 
our business is founded on technological leadership 
innovation provides opportunities for us in growth markets as well as advantages over our competitors 
from a base of approximately  patents  we use our product development and formulation expertise to sustain our leading market positions and fuel our future growth 
we create additives  ingredients  resins and compounds that enhance the performance  quality and value of our customers products  while minimizing their environmental impact 
our products are used in a broad range of applications and are sold into relatively stable markets such as those for engine oils  specialty driveline lubricants and metalworking fluids  as well as higher growth markets such as personal care and over the counter pharmaceutical products  performance coatings  medical products and compressor lubricants 
our specialty chemical products also are used in a variety of industries  including the construction  sporting goods  medical and automotive industries 
we are diverse geographically  with an extensive global manufacturing  supply chain  technical and commercial infrastructure 
we operate facilities in countries  including production facilities in countries and laboratories in countries  in key regions around the world through the efforts of approximately  employees 
we sell our products in more than countries and believe that our customers recognize and value our ability to provide customized  high quality  cost effective performance formulations and solutions worldwide 
we also believe our customers highly value our global supply chain capabilities 
we use a broad range of raw materials in our manufacturing processes 
the majority of our raw materials are feedstocks derived from petroleum and petrochemicals  with lubricant base oil being our single largest raw material 
the cost of our raw materials can be highly volatile 
as a result  our financial performance is influenced significantly by how effectively we manage the margin between our selling prices and the cost of our raw materials 
we are organized into two operating and reportable segments called lubrizol additives and lubrizol advanced materials  and we are an industry leader in many of the markets in which our product lines compete 
lubrizol additives consists of two product lines i engine additives and ii driveline and industrial additives 
engine additives is comprised of additives for lubricating engine oils  such as for gasoline  diesel  marine and stationary engines  and additives for fuels  refinery and oil field chemicals 
driveline and industrial additives is comprised of additives for driveline oils  such as automatic transmission fluids  gear oils and tractor lubricants and industrial additives  such as additives for hydraulic  grease and metalworking fluids  as well as compressor lubricants 
both product lines sell viscosity modifiers  as well as provide services for supply chain and knowledge center management 
the lubrizol advanced materials segment consists of three product lines i engineered polymers  ii noveon consumer specialties and iii performance coatings 
the engineered polymers product line includes products such as estane thermoplastic polyurethane and temprite engineered polymers used within the construction  automotive  telecommunications  electronics and recreation industries 
the noveon consumer specialties product line includes acrylic thickeners  film formers  fixatives  emollients  silicones  specialty surfactants  methyl glucoside  lanolin derivatives and cassia hydrocolloids used within cosmetics  personal care and household products 
the performance coatings product line includes high performance polymers and additives for specialty paper  graphic arts  paints  textiles and coatings applications that are sold to customers worldwide 
the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents lubrizol additives segment we believe we are the market leader in lubricant additives and intend to remain the leader by continuing to invest in this business 
our lubrizol additives segment s growth strategy is to continue to optimize our product mix while closely aligning production capacity with product demand 
challenging market forces and conditions continue to influence the lubrizol additives segment 
a key factor is the low long term global growth rate for this market  which we believe is in the range of approximately to per year 
additional characteristics of this market are frequent product specification changes primarily driven by original equipment manufacturers oems and the impact of environmental and fuel economy regulations on the oems 
the specification changes require us to incur product development and testing costs  but also enable us to apply our technology know how to create products and solve problems 
we believe our technology  and our expertise in applying it  are key strengths 
improved engine design  which can result in longer lubricant drain intervals 
longer drain intervals reduce demand for finished lubricants 
new vehicle production levels  which affect our driveline fluids in particular because the initial factory fill is an important market factor in that product line 
reliance on raw material feedstocks derived from petroleum and petrochemicals  the costs of which can be highly volatile 
our lubrizol additives segment represented approximately of consolidated revenues 
lubrizol advanced materials segment our lubrizol advanced materials segment s growth strategy involves a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
our internal growth strategy is to use our strengths  including our technology  formulating skills and broad geographic infrastructure  to develop and invest in new performance technologies in higher growth industrial and consumer markets 
in addition to internal growth  we intend to pursue bolt on acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the thermoplastic polyurethane business from the dow chemical company dow in  which we expect to provide cost synergies  new technology and the opportunity to take existing products into new geographies 
key factors to our success continue to be the introduction of new products  development of new applications for existing products  ability to manage margins  geographic expansion and the integration of future acquisitions 
our lubrizol advanced materials segment represented approximately of consolidated revenues 
primary factors affecting results the following factors most affected our consolidated results the global recession affected the markets we serve and negatively impacted our sales volume 
volume declined compared with as demand declined sharply and customers reduced their inventory levels 
however  we believe inventory destocking substantially was complete by the end of the second quarter as we experienced significant demand recovery in the second half of influenced by customers replenishing their inventories 
our disciplined margin management and cost reduction initiatives offset the decline in volume and resulted in an increase in our gross profit percentage to from in our inventory reduction initiatives contributed to the significant increase in cash flow from operations 
we ended with abnormally high inventories as a result of a severe decline in demand in the fourth quarter of in  in response to the lower sales volume  we reduced production in order to reduce inventories 
as a result of our abnormally low production  we incurred million of unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
the reduction in inventory also resulted in charges of million due to the liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at higher costs 
our aggressive cost reduction actions and organizational restructuring increased operating efficiencies and improved profitability 
we reduced expenses by curtailing production and reducing spending on supplies and services  information technology and travel expenses 
manufacturing and star selling  testing  administrative and research expenses also both benefited from a favorable currency impact 
however  the effect of our cost reduction initiatives was offset by the increase in incentive and deferred compensation expenses described below 
in conjunction with our cost reduction actions  we incurred million of severance and benefit charges and million of asset impairment charges 
the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents our actual and projected financial performance relative to our annual and long term incentive compensation plan targets resulted in additional incentive compensation expense of million compared with further  appreciation in the liabilities recorded for our deferred compensation plans and stock appreciation rights  which primarily are based on the value of lubrizol stock  resulted in additional compensation expense of million compared with the issuance of million of notes and the million term loan  coupled with lower interest income  increased our net interest expense 
the proceeds from these borrowings provided us with sufficient funds to retire in full the notes due  repay in full our outstanding us revolver balance  fund the acquisition of the thermoplastic polyurethane business from dow and strengthen our liquidity with approximately million of additional cash

cost of sales the decrease in cost of sales compared with primarily was due to lower volume and a decline in average raw material cost 
total manufacturing expenses were level compared with as lower utility costs  a favorable currency impact  reductions in spending on supplies and services  and lower salaries and benefits were offset by increased incentive compensation expense and incremental costs from acquisitions 
in response to the lower sales volume  we reduced production in order to reduce inventories  and  as a result  we incurred million of unabsorbed manufacturing costs due to abnormally low production 
manufacturing costs in included million of unabsorbed costs associated with the temporary shutdown of our two houston area manufacturing facilities due to hurricane ike and the temporary shutdown of production lines in the fourth quarter to reduce inventories 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  compared with primarily due to lower raw material costs and an improvement in the combination of price and product mix  which more than offset lower volume and an unfavorable currency impact 
our gross profit percentage increased to compared with in as a result of lower average raw material cost and price increases initiated in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  compared with primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense of million  deferred compensation expense of million and million of charitable contributions to the lubrizol foundation  partially offset by our cost reduction initiatives that included lower expenses for information technology and travel  and a favorable currency impact 
research  testing and development expenses the timing and amount of research  testing and development expenses are affected by lubricant additives product standards  which change periodically to meet new emissions  efficiency  durability and other performance factors as oems improve engine and transmission designs 
research  testing and development expenses decreased million  or  compared with primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives that included lower expenses for supplies  services and travel  along with a favorable currency impact  partially offset by increased incentive compensation 
restructuring and impairment charges the components of the restructuring and impairment charges are detailed as follows year ended december  in millions of dollars asset impairments other plant exit costs severance and benefits total corporate organizational restructuring long lived asset impairments lubrizol advanced materials plant closures and workforce reductions lubrizol additives plant closure and workforce reductions performance coatings business improvement initiatives total restructuring and impairment charges restructuring charges of million related to our organizational restructuring initiated during  which increased operating efficiencies and improved profitability 
long lived asset impairments of million primarily related to the write off of preliminary process engineering design work associated with our plan  announced in march  to build a lubricant additives plant in china 
due to lower expected demand caused by the global recession  significant uncertainty arose regarding the timing of the china project and resulted in revisions to the scope and location of the plant 
as a result  the recoverability of the asset for preliminary process engineering design work performed was affected adversely and the associated asset was impaired 
restructuring charges of million related to our decision to cease manufacturing at two us facilities to improve profitability within the performance coatings and engineered polymers product lines of the lubrizol advanced materials segment 
manufacturing of engineered polymers products at one of the closed facilities will be transferred to other facilities to improve the utilization of existing assets 
the long lived asset impairment charges represent the excess of the carrying value of the asset groups over their fair value 
the fair value of the asset groups was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows attributable to the asset groups over their remaining useful life

the increase in manufacturing expenses partially was offset by lower environmental related charges in gross profit gross profit increased million compared with  as improvements in the combination of price and product mix and a favorable currency impact were offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs and lower volume 
our gross profit percentage decreased to compared with in as the increase in revenues from pricing improvements to recover higher raw material and manufacturing costs was substantially greater than the increase in gross profit dollars 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  compared with primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense  partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact and increased project costs associated with the implementation of a common information systems platform primarily in the lubrizol advanced materials segment 
research  testing and development expenses technology expenses increased million  or  compared with primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits and higher outside testing expenses 
write off of acquired in process research and development we incurred a charge of million in to write off the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development ipr d projects associated with the acquisition of the thermoplastic polyurethane business from dow 
costs to acquire ipr d projects that have no alternative future use and that have not yet reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed for acquisitions completed prior to january  restructuring and impairment charges the components of the restructuring and impairment charges are detailed as follows year ended december  in millions of dollars asset impairments other plant exit costs severance and benefits total goodwill impairment charges performance coatings business improvement initiatives lubrizol advanced materials plant closures and workforce reductions lubrizol additives plant closure and workforce reductions total restructuring and impairment charges after performing our annual goodwill impairment test as of october   we determined that million of goodwill associated with our estane  temprite and performance coatings reporting units was impaired as the carrying value of goodwill within these reporting units exceeded its fair value 
we use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the impairment charge included the partial the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents impairment of the goodwill of the estane and temprite reporting units and the full impairment of the goodwill of the performance coatings reporting unit 
the impairment charge for the estane reporting unit was driven mainly by the increase in our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of the impairment charge for the temprite reporting unit was driven mainly by the increase in our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in the reporting unit s near term earnings outlook 
the impairment charge for the performance coatings reporting unit was driven mainly by the reporting unit s weak performance and outlook in light of economic conditions 
business improvement initiatives and impairments of long lived assets primarily within the performance coatings product line of the lubrizol advanced materials segment resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million during we completed the disposition of a textile compounding plant and recognized an asset impairment for a textile coatings production line in the first quarter of in the second quarter of  we announced additional steps to improve the profitability of our us performance coatings business 
manufacturing of select products at various locations ceased or was transferred to more efficient production facilities in order to align manufacturing with its end use markets 
in addition  we restructured the sales  marketing and research and development organizations within our performance coatings product line 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge associated with long lived assets in our performance coatings product line as a result of declining demand in our textile applications 
the long lived asset impairment charges represent the excess of carrying value of the asset groups over their fair value 
in the third quarter of  we decided to close a lubrizol additives blending  packaging and warehouse facility in ontario  canada  which resulted in charges of million 
the components of the restructuring and impairment charges are detailed as follows year ended december  in millions of dollars asset impairments other plant exit costs severance and benefits total lubrizol advanced materials plant closures and workforce reductions bromborough  uk plant closure and sale corporate other workforce reductions total restructuring and impairment charges in  we recorded aggregate restructuring and impairment charges of million primarily related to impairment charges in the lubrizol advanced materials segment  partially offset by a gain recorded on the sale of a lubrizol additives manufacturing facility located in bromborough  united kingdom 
in connection with the sale of our bromborough facility  we received net cash proceeds of million and recorded a pretax gain of million 
other income net other income net was million compared with other income net of million in the increase in other income net primarily was due to increased foreign currency gains  partially offset by the non recurrence of a million gain on the sale of land recognized during interest expense net the increase in interest expense net compared with primarily was due to a decrease in interest income of million as a result of our lower cash and cash equivalents balances  partially offset by lower interest expense of million associated with our reduced debt balances 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was over compared with in the increase in the effective tax rate primarily was due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge  the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes  and an increase in non deductible foreign currency translation losses associated with international subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar 
these factors were offset partially by an improvement in our geographic earnings mix and the favorable resolution of prior years uncertain tax positions 
excluding the impact of restructuring and impairment charges  our effective tax rate would have been in net loss income attributable to the lubrizol corporation primarily as a result of goodwill impairment charges along with the other factors discussed above  net loss attributable to the lubrizol corporation was million per diluted share compared to net income of million per diluted share in the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents segment analysis we primarily evaluate performance and allocate resources based on segment operating income as well as projected future performance 
segment operating income is defined as revenues less expenses identifiable to the segment 
segment operating income will reconcile to consolidated income before income taxes by deducting corporate expenses and corporate other income that are not attributable to the segments  the write off of acquired ipr d  restructuring and impairment charges and net interest expense

in february  we entered into a million term loan that we subsequently repaid in full in december the term loan was an unsecured  senior obligation that bore interest based upon libor plus a specified credit spread 
the term loan was prepaid without penalty 
in january  we issued senior unsecured notes having an aggregate principal amount of million at a price of 
the notes mature in february and bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually on february and august of each year 
including debt issuance costs  original issue discounts and losses on treasury rate lock agreements  the notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 
the notes include a step up in interest payable in the event of certain ratings downgrades by credit rating agencies 
upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event  as defined in the indenture  we would be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at of their principal amount 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from these notes to repurchase million of the notes in march and repay in full on october   the remaining aggregate principal amount of the notes 
under the us and euro bank credit agreements  we are required to comply with financial ratios of debt to consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary  unusual or non recurring non cash gains or losses  including the sale of property and equipment and goodwill impairments  and non cash gains or losses from less than wholly owned subsidiaries and investments consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreements  and consolidated ebitda to interest expense 
at december   the credit agreements required that the ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda be less than and the ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense be greater than at december   we maintained a ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda of and a ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents on january   we announced our decision to proceed with a year phased investment plan to upgrade operations and increase global capacity in our lubrizol additives segment 
we plan to make a greenfield investment in china as well as implement a debottlenecking program at our existing facilities in the united states and europe 
as part of the year plan  we signed a letter of intent to reserve land use rights in china for a wholly owned manufacturing plant  which will be developed and phased in as market needs require 
by phasing in selective capacity additions in china  we aim to match our manufacturing capability with lubricant growth in asia 
we expect that the china plant will require an investment in excess of million over the next three years 
in addition  we plan to accelerate reinvestment at existing plants for upgrading infrastructure  as well as ensuring compliance with ever increasing health  safety and environmental requirements 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity under the credit facilities and our current cash and cash equivalents provide sufficient liquidity to maintain our current operations and capital expenditure requirements  pay dividends  resume our share repurchase program  pursue acquisitions and service our debt 
contractual cash obligations the following table shows our contractual cash obligations under debt agreements  leases  non cancelable purchase commitments and other long term liabilities at december  payments due by period in millions of dollars total and after total debt interest operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations total debt includes both the current and long term portions of debt as reported in note to the consolidated financial statements  excluding original issue discounts and unrealized gains on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt 
interest represents estimated contractual payments for fixed rate debt only 
we are not able to estimate reasonably the cash payments for interest associated with variable rate debt due to the significant estimation required relating to both market interest rates as well as projected principal payments 
non cancelable purchase commitments primarily include raw materials purchased under take or pay contracts  drumming  service contracts  utility purchase agreements and toll processing arrangements 
we are required to make minimum contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans pursuant to the minimum funding requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and the employee retirement income security act of  as amended 
funding requirements for plans outside the united states are subject to applicable local regulations 
in  we expect to make employer contributions of approximately million to the qualified plans to satisfy these minimum statutory funding requirements 
the expected payments associated with these plans represent an actuarial estimate of future assumed payments based upon retirement and payment patterns 
in addition  we expect non pension postretirement benefit payments to approximate million in we have included these expected contributions of million in the above table 
due to uncertainties regarding the assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our pension and non pension postretirement benefit plans  including i interest rate levels  ii the amount and timing of asset returns  and iii what  if any  changes may occur in pension funding legislation  the estimates in the table may differ materially from actual future payments 
we cannot reasonably estimate payments beyond other long term liabilities disclosed in the table represent long term liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheet at december   under noncurrent liabilities  excluding postemployment  environmental and other non contractual liabilities 
at december   we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million relating to uncertain tax positions 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these tax positions  we are unable to estimate when cash settlement may occur 
our debt level will require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments  thereby reducing the availability of our cash for acquisitions or other purposes 
nevertheless  we believe our future operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover debt service  capital expenditures  dividends  share repurchases and other obligations  and we have untapped borrowing capacity that can provide us with additional financial resources 
we currently have a shelf registration statement filed with the sec pursuant to which the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents debt securities  preferred or common shares  or warrants may be issued 
in addition  at december   we maintained cash and cash equivalents balances of million and had million available under the us revolving credit facility and million million available under the euro revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no special purpose entities or off balance sheet debt  other than operating leases in the ordinary course of business that are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million of contingent obligations under standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business to financial institutions  customers and insurance companies to secure short term support for a variety of commercial transactions  insurance and benefit programs 
in connection with the sale of our food ingredients and industrial specialties business to spm group holdings  llc  now known as emerald performance materials  llc emerald  in may  we provided indemnifications to emerald with respect to the business sold 
these indemnifications have been associated with the price and quantity of raw material purchases  permit costs  costs incurred due to the inability to obtain permits and environmental matters 
the indemnifications related to the price of raw material purchases expired on december   with the remaining indemnifications expiring on december  in each of these circumstances  our payment is dependent on emerald filing a claim 
in addition  our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount 
for those indemnification agreements where a payment by us was probable and estimable  we recorded a liability at december  we believe that if losses are incurred in any of these matters  such losses would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
transactions with related parties we enter into a number of business arrangements with related parties  principally with the noncontrolling interests in consolidated companies and our equity affiliates 
these arrangements primarily include the sale of lubricant additives and the purchase of raw materials

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates at a specific point in time that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have utilized available information including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming our estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating our estimates inherent in these financial statements may not materialize 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to similar businesses 
accounting for sales discounts  allowances and rebates we offer sales discounts and rebates to certain customers to promote customer loyalty and to encourage greater product sales 
these rebate programs provide that upon the attainment of pre established volumes or the attainment of revenue milestones for a specified period  the customer receives credits against purchases 
we estimate the provision for rebates based upon the specific terms in each agreement at the time of shipment and an estimate of the customer s achievement of the respective revenue milestones 
we accrue customer claims  returns and allowances and discounts based upon our history of claims and sales returns and allowances 
the estimated provisions significantly could be affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
accounting for reserves and contingencies our accounting policies for reserves and contingencies cover a wide variety of business activities  including reserves for potentially uncollectible receivables  slow moving or obsolete inventory and legal and environmental exposures 
we accrue these reserves when our assessments indicate that it is probable that we have incurred a liability or will not recover an asset and we can reasonably estimate an amount 
for income tax exposures  we only recognize the economic benefit associated with a tax position if it is more likely than not that we ultimately will sustain a tax position 
after this threshold is met  we report an income tax position at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not ultimately to be sustained 
we review these estimates quarterly based on currently available information 
actual results may differ from our estimates  and our estimates may be revised depending upon the outcome or changed expectations based on the facts surrounding each exposure 
we discuss annually with the audit committee of our board of directors our reserves and contingencies  as well as our policies and processes for evaluating them 
the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents capitalization of inventory costs our inventories are stated at cost  which includes expenditures directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventory to its finished state and location 
we capitalize variable production overhead to each unit of production on the basis of the actual use of our production facilities 
we capitalize fixed production overhead based on the normal capacity of our production facilities 
normal capacity represents a range of production levels expected to be achieved over a number of periods under normal operating conditions 
the determination of normal capacity requires a significant amount of management judgment 
our range of normal capacity is based on our historical production levels  taking into consideration any changes in production capabilities at our facilities 
in periods of abnormally low production  fixed production overhead that exceeds normal levels is expensed in the current period 
in periods of abnormally high production  the amount of fixed overhead capitalized to each unit of production is decreased so that inventories are not measured above cost 
in  in response to the lower sales volume  we reduced production in order to reduce inventories  and  as a result  we incurred million of unabsorbed manufacturing costs due to abnormally low production 
in  manufacturing costs included million of unabsorbed costs associated with the temporary shutdown of our two houston area manufacturing facilities due to hurricane ike and the temporary shutdown of production lines in the fourth quarter to reduce inventories 
determination of net periodic pension cost each year we review with our actuaries the actuarial assumptions used in the determination of net periodic pension cost 
the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  which are influenced significantly by conditions within the debt and equity markets 
other assumptions include the rate of compensation increase and demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover 
we review the critical assumptions for our pension plans with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our net periodic pension cost for our us pension plans was million in  million in and million in our net periodic pension cost for all pension plans was million in  million in and million in the net periodic pension cost for all plans included settlement losses of million in and million in no settlement losses were incurred in in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect the expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we are required to select a discount rate  which represents our best estimate of the cost in the marketplace to settle all pension obligations through annuity purchases  to determine the value of future pension plan obligations 
we determine the discount rate based upon current market indicators  including yields from published bond portfolios that provide for a general matching of bond maturities with the projected benefit cash flows from our plans 
the published bond portfolios consist of non callable corporate bonds that are at least aa quality 
volatility in the corporate debt markets directly impacts our assumed discount rate 
in determining net periodic pension cost for the year ended december   we set our weighted average discount rates for the us pension plans and us pension plans at and on a weighted average basis for all plans  respectively 
a change in the discount rate of basis points would have had the following effects on net periodic pension cost basis point in millions of dollars increase decrease us pension plans international pension plans all pension plans in developing our assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we considered historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio 
a sustained depression in the returns of debt and equity securities could cause a reduction in our assumed return on plan assets 
at december   our us pension plans assets had an investment mix that approximated in equity securities and in fixed income and other securities  while our non us pension plans assets had an investment mix that approximated in equity securities and in fixed income and other securities 
in determining net periodic pension cost for the year ended december   we set our weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the us pension plans and us pension plans at and on a weighted average basis for all plans  respectively  based on our investment mix and projected market conditions 
we believe our expected long term rates of return represent reasonable returns that could be achieved over the long term using our current asset allocations 
the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents a change in the rate of return of basis points would have had the following effects on net periodic pension cost basis point in millions of dollars increase decrease us pension plans international pension plans all pension plans we expect the pension expense to be approximately million  excluding expected settlement charges 
for the year ended december   our weighted average discount rate assumptions for net periodic pension cost for the us pension plans and us pension plans are and on a weighted average basis for all plans  respectively 
our weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the us pension plans and us pension plans are and on a weighted average basis for all plans  respectively 
the expected increase in pension expense in primarily is due to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses 
accounting for business combinations we allocate the purchase price of business combinations to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the date of acquisition 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  we consider information obtained during our due diligence process and utilize various valuation methods including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows 
we are required to make subjective estimates in connection with these valuations and allocations 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  including disposition  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
in order to determine if an asset has been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable  independent  cash flows are available 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets 
fair value generally is determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires us to make significant estimates and consider the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could impact materially our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   we recorded long lived asset impairment charges of million primarily related to the write off of preliminary process engineering design work associated with our plans  announced in march  to build a lubricant additives plant in china and our decision to cease manufacturing at two us facilities within the lubrizol advanced materials segment 
the impairment charges represent the excess of carrying value of the asset groups over their fair value 
the fair value of the asset groups was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows attributable to the asset groups over their remaining useful life 
accounting for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
we assign goodwill arising from businesses acquired to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
our reporting units are either at the operating segment level or a component one level below our operating segments that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we have determined that our lubrizol additives operating segment constitutes a reporting unit  and that our estane engineered polymers business  temprite engineered polymers business  noveon consumer specialties product line and performance coatings product line within our lubrizol advanced materials operating segment constitute separate reporting units 
we assign assets and liabilities  including deferred income taxes  to our reporting units if the asset or liability relates to the operations of a reporting unit and is considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
cash and debt obligations are excluded from the carrying value of our reporting units 
goodwill is tested annually each october  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
at december   the remaining value of goodwill associated with our lubrizol additives  estane  temprite and noveon consumer specialties reporting units totaled million  million  million and million  respectively 
no goodwill remains within our performance coatings reporting unit at december  the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of after tax earnings  foreign currency exchange rates  expected capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which are based upon our long range plan 
our long range plan is updated each fall as part of our annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management and our board of directors 
a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit  and is added to the present value of the forecasted cash flows 
the growth rate is the rate at which a reporting unit s cash flow is expected to grow beyond the period covered by the long range plan 
lastly  we develop a weighted average cost of capital to discount the expected future cash flows 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise  with the weighting of returns based on the capitalization of comparable companies 
the sum of the calculated fair values of the reporting units is then reconciled to our total market capitalization  which includes an estimated control premium based on levels being paid currently within our industry 
we include a control premium as the quoted market price of a single share of our common stock does not reflect the value that would be derived from owning a controlling interest in our individual reporting units 
we corroborate our estimated control premium by comparing it to those paid in recent acquisitions within the chemical industry 
if the discounted cash flow analysis yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we would proceed to step two of the impairment test 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
in performing this allocation of fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  we obtain appraisals of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets from third party valuation firms to support the fair values allocated 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and  if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and weighted average cost of capital assumptions  however  actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly 
no impairment of goodwill was identified in connection with the annual impairment test 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units at october   were the expected after tax cash flows for the period of to  terminal growth rates of to and weighted average costs of capital of to 
a decrease in the fair value of our temprite reporting unit could indicate the potential for an impairment of its goodwill 
our temprite reporting unit serves customers who produce plastic piping for residential and commercial plumbing  fire sprinkler systems and industrial piping applications  and is thus subject to cyclical demand patterns within these markets 
to the extent the weakness in the residential and commercial markets persists longer than expected  or the capital markets deteriorate  our temprite reporting unit may experience a decline in fair value that could result in an impairment 
a decrease in the fair value of our estane reporting unit could indicate the potential for an impairment of its goodwill 
the products within our estane reporting unit are used within film and sheet coating processes  wire and cable insulation  athletic equipment such as footwear  medical products  pneumatic tubing and automotive molded parts  and are subject to overall economic conditions 
to the extent the weakness in the economy persists longer than expected  or the capital markets deteriorate  our estane reporting unit may experience a decline in fair value that could result in an impairment 
the fair value of our noveon consumer specialties and lubrizol additives reporting units would have to decline by over and  respectively  to indicate the potential for an impairment of their goodwill 
after performing our annual goodwill impairment test as of october   we determined million of goodwill associated with our estane  temprite and performance coatings reporting units was impaired as the carrying value of goodwill within these reporting units exceeded its fair value 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our estane  temprite and performance coatings reporting units at october   were the expected after tax cash flows for the period of to  a terminal growth rate of and a weighted average cost of capital of  representing an increase from the weighted average cost of capital of used in the impairment charge included the partial impairment of the goodwill of the estane and temprite reporting units and the full impairment of the goodwill of the performance coatings reporting unit 
the impairment charge for the estane reporting unit was driven mainly by the increase in our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of the impairment charge for the temprite reporting unit was driven mainly by the increase in our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in the reporting unit s near term earnings outlook 
the increase in our cost of capital accounted for the entire decline in fair value of our estane reporting unit and approximately of the decline in fair value of our temprite reporting unit from the prior year 
the impairment charge for the per the lubrizol corporation 
table of contents formance coatings reporting unit was driven mainly by the reporting unit s weak performance and outlook in light of economic conditions 
the table below presents the impact a change in the following significant assumptions would have had on our impairment charge recognized at october   assuming all other assumptions and factors remained constant approximate increase decrease to impairment charge in millions of dollars change estane temprite performance coatings weighted average cost of capital weighted average cost of capital after tax cash flows after tax cash flows the major components of the company s other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions are customer lists  technology  trademarks  patents  land use rights  favorable lease arrangements and non compete agreements 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives that range between and years  except for land use rights that have useful lives up to years 
intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
we have elected october as the annual evaluation date to test for potential impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
a relief from royalty model is used to determine whether the fair value of an intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount 
the relief from royalty calculations require us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenues related to the intangibles  market royalty rates for intellectual property  future tax rates and amortization related tax benefits  and discount rates 
as of october   we assumed market royalty rates ranging from to of future levels of revenues and discount rates ranging from to 
after performing our annual impairment test as of october   we determined million of indefinite lived intangibles within our performance coatings product line was impaired 
as part of the annual impairment test  the non amortized intangible assets are reviewed to determine if the indefinite life determination remains appropriate 
asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro at the time it is identified and when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
we have recognized liabilities for aros related to certain of our leased facilities 
in addition  we have identified aros for asbestos remediation activities that may be required at other company owned facilities in the future 
however  due to the long term  productive nature of some of our manufacturing operations  absent plans or expectation of plans to initiate asset retirement activities  we are unable to reasonably estimate the fair value of such asbestos remediation liabilities since the potential settlement dates cannot be determined at this time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate manufacturing and blending facilities  laboratories and offices around the world and utilize fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our global operations 
as a result  we are subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainties  import and export limitations  and market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe the political and economic risks related to our foreign operations are mitigated due to the relative stability of the countries in which our largest foreign operations are located 
in the normal course of business  we use derivative financial instruments including interest rate and commodity hedges and forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage our market risks 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on our earnings and cash flow 
our objective in managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on our earnings and cash flow associated with such changes 
our primary currency exposures are the euro  the pound sterling  the japanese yen and the brazilian real
