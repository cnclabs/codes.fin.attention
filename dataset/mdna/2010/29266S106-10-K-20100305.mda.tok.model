item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item a of part i  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the development  manufacturing  marketing and sale of minimally invasive treatments for aortic disorders 
our primary focus is the marketing and sale of the powerlink system  a catheter based alternative treatment to surgery for aaa 
beginning in  our sole source of revenue is sales of the powerlink system 
prior to  we also generated license revenue from the licensing of our technology from our previous line of business 
for the year ended december   we had net sales of million  which was an increase of approximately from the year ended december   and incurred a net loss of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have experienced year over year sales growth since the commercial launch of the powerlink system in the united states in we now sell our products in the united states  europe  asia and south america 
as a result of our history of operating losses  we had limited resources with which to develop additional products beyond the powerlink system 
however  in we generated approximately million of cash flow from operations and received approximately million net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock  as well as entered into a new long term credit facility whereby we may borrow up to million 
based on this increase in capital resources  we have the ability to increase our research and development efforts to develop new technologies for the treatment of aortic disorders  which we believe is vital to the future growth of our business 
summary of accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the following critical accounting policies and estimates were used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the relevant receivable is probable at the time of sale  and products have been shipped or used and the customer has taken ownership and assumed risk of loss 
for domestic sales  we generally recognize revenue upon completion of a procedure  when our product is implanted in a patient 
for international sales  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of our products to a distributor 
in the past  we have earned royalty revenue  which was included in license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations  as a result of the sale of product rights and technologies to third parties 
royalties were recognized upon the sale of products subject to the royalty by the third party 
we do not offer rights of return and we have no post delivery obligations other than our specified warranty 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to us indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations could cause us to write down the asset value and record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is potential goodwill impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets include legal and regulatory considerations 
income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the financial statements  as well as operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero  because we believe that  based upon a number of factors  it is more likely than 
table of contents not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense over a stock option award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock option grants 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and the option s expected life 
the financial statements include such amounts based on our best estimates and judgments 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to the increased productivity of our sales force  the introduction of new products including powerlink xl  our suprarenal proximal extension  and the intuitrak delivery system  and increased physician acceptance of the powerlink system 
domestic sales increased from million to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states increased from million in to million in this increase was driven primarily by the introduction of intuitrak to most of our international distributors 
additionally  we had higher sales to our distributors in south america and japan and an initial sale generating stocking order from our distributor in china 
we expect that product sales will increase in by an estimated to from  to million to million 
based on the timing of new product launches and continued improvements in sales force productivity  we expect that the majority of the revenue growth will be weighted in the second half of the year 
outside the united states  we expect growth in each of our major markets of europe  asia  and south america 
cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue  which includes labor  overhead  materials and parts  rent  depreciation  small tools and supplies  samples for destructive testing  and utilities  among other items  increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of powerlink system sales  partially offset by efficiencies in our manufacturing process 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to and from a favorable product mix due to new product introductions  which have a higher average selling price 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in for these reasons 
we believe that gross profit dollars will increase in due to higher commercial sales of the powerlink system both in and outside of the united states 
we also expect that gross profit as a percentage of product revenues will increase due to efficiencies from higher manufacturing volumes required to support sales growth 
research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses increased by to million from million in the increase primarily resulted from costs associated with the development of new products for the treatment of aortic disorders 
we expect that these expenses will significantly increase in as we pursue opportunities to develop additional new products for the treatment of aortic disorders and costs associated with the bilateral percutaneous clinical trial 
we also expect expenses to increase in subsequent years as we increase our new product development activities 

table of contents marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to higher sales commission payouts on the growth in domestic sales revenue and an increase in marketing efforts related to our product launches in we expect that marketing and sales expense will increase in due to higher commission expense on the expected increase in sales and due to higher compensation costs associated with the expected increase in the number of sales territories by approximately by the end of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to  in costs associated with our chief executive officer succession  which occurred in may  and significant legal fees that occurred in these reductions were partially offset by higher stock based compensation charges and incentive comepensation accruals based on performance metrics in we expect that general and administrative expenses in will be approximately unchanged from other income expense 
other income expense decreased to  in from  in an increase in interest income was offset by expenses related to interest expense incurred in the first three quarters of we expect that other income will increase due to interest income on a higher average cash balance in  and lower interest expense 
comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to the increased productivity of our domestic field sales personnel  and the introduction of our suprarenal proximal extensions and powerlink xl products 
domestic sales increased from million to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to sales to our distributor in japan  as well as an increase in sales to distributors in south america 
license revenue 
license revenue decreased to  in from  in license revenue from abbott remained at the contractual minimum level of  for  and expectedly declined sharply in as the minimum royalty provision of the agreement expired at december  the license expired and was fully paid up in june additionally in  due to our licensing agreement with biolucent  we received  in royalties and fees  including a one time payment of  in exchange for a fully paid up license to certain of our patents in a certain field of use 
beginning january   sales of our powerlink system were our only material source of revenue 
cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue  which includes labor  overhead  materials and parts  rent  depreciation  small tools and supplies  samples for destructive testing  and utilities  among other items  decreased to million from million in this decrease is directly attributable to the substitution of lower cost in house produced graft material in a majority of the products sold in gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to and a reduction in the per unit cost of product due to substitution of lower cost in house produced graft material in a majority of the products sold in gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in for these reasons 
research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to million from million in the decrease primarily resulted from lower costs associated with clinical trials in the period 
we recorded  in and  in  of stock compensation expense 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to higher sales commission payouts on the growth in domestic sales revenue  severance payments  and the implementation of an in depth sales training program 
we recorded million in and  in  respectively  of stock compensation expense 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in the increase was due primarily to increases in patent and legal fees  settlement of the legal dispute with cook  our chief executive officer succession process  and our analysis and response to the unsolicited acquisition proposal from elliott associates 
in addition  stock based compensation expense totaled million in as compared to  in termination of supply agreement 
termination of supply agreement expense was  in the expense was due to the third amendment to our supply agreement for eptfe graft material with bard peripheral  dated september   which reduced the minimum purchase requirement for the year from million to million  and wherein both parties agreed to terminate the agreement on december  in consideration for the reduction in the minimum purchase requirement for the year  we paid  to bard peripheral 
other income 
other income decreased to  from million in the decrease in other income was primarily the result of a realized gain of  on our investment in biolucent in  lower interest income  and higher interest expense in due to drawing down on the term loan and revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank in september liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
historically  we have relied on the sale and issuance of equity securities to provide a significant portion of funding for our operations 
in august  we completed a sale of our common stock that resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
in  we began to generate positive cash flows from operations for the first time in our history 
in october  we entered into a revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  or wells  whereby we may borrow up to million 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the greater of day libor  the federal funds rate  or the lender s prime rate  plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the unused portion is subject to an unused revolving line facility fee  payable quarterly  in arrears  on a calendar year basis  in an amount equal to per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line  as determined by wells 
the credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business and financial covenants relating to ratios of current assets to current liabilities and tangible net worth during any calendar quarter and is collateralized by all of our assets with the exception of our intellectual property 
all amounts owing under the credit facility will become due and payable on april  as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we generated million of operating cash flow in we believe that our current cash balance  in combination with cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
if we do not realize expected revenue and gross profit margin levels  are unable to manage our operating expenses in line with our revenues  cannot maintain our days sales outstanding accounts receivable level  we may not continue to achieve positive cash flow from operations  we may need to obtain additional financing 
we believe that the future growth of our business will depend upon our ability to successfully develop new technologies for the treatment of aortic disorders and bring these technologies to market  and to increase the size and productivity of our direct sales force 
in order to achieve these objectives  we may need to seek additional sources of financing 
in the event that we require additional funding  we will attempt to raise the required capital through either debt or equity arrangements 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the need for additional capital to fund future development programs or sales force expansion  the need for additional capital to fund business development acquisition s  our requirements for additional facility space or manufacturing capacity  
table of contents our requirements for additional information technology infrastructure and systems  and adverse outcome s from current or future litigation and the cost to defend such litigation 
if we are required to obtain additional financing  we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain such financing it may cause substantial dilution for our stockholders  in the case of an equity financing  or may contain burdensome restrictions on the operations of our business  in the case of debt financing 
accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to the increase in product sales in inventories 
inventories decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of a lower cost basis of the eptfe graft material and the complete transition to the intuitrak product line 
accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily attributable higher accruals in related to incentive bonus and commission programs and higher accrued legal services cash provided by used in operations 
in  cash provided by operations was million as compared to cash used in operations of in the change was primarily attributed to a higher sales volume and improved inventory turns 
cash used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the change was due to the elimination of a restricted cash requirement of  from our primary lender 
cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our equity offering of million in in  we borrowed million  which was repaid in off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements
