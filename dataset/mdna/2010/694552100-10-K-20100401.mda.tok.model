vs 
pacific mercantile bank  filed in may in the california superior court for the county of orange case no 

this lawsuit was initially filed as an individual action by two plaintiffs for alleged violations by the bank of the federal truth in lending act the tila 
the two plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint on three occasions  between november and may  seeking to convert their individual action into a class action suit and adding additional allegations and seeking rescission of all loans made to the members of the class and damages based on allegations of fraud in the inducement of certain loans  unfair business practices and violations of tila 
in each case  the bank filed demurs in which the bank asserted that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a legal basis for any recovery and in each case the trial court sustained the bank s demurs and dismissed the plaintiffs lawsuit 
plaintiffs subsequently appealed the trial court s rulings 
in january  the appellate court  in a published decision  affirmed the trial court s order dismissing the plaintiffs suit  finding that plaintiffs had no right to assert class wide claims of rescission 
plaintiffs then appealed this decision to the us supreme court which  in may  denied plaintiffs petition for review  effectively sustaining the appellate court s ruling 
plaintiffs  abandoning their claims of fraud and unfair business practices on the part of the bank  then filed a motion with the trial court for class certification limited to the tila and certain related statutory claims 
following a hearing  in january the trial court denied the motion for class certification  finding that plaintiffs had not shown evidence that there were common questions of law or fact to justify certifying a class and had been unable to introduce any admissible evidence establishing that any statutory violations had occurred during the relevant class period 
as a result of the trial court s ruling  the two named plaintiffs were left only with individual claims for statutory damages under tila  which would not have been material in amount 
however  in april  plaintiffs filed an appeal of the trial court s denial of their motion for class certification on the claims under tila and certain other related statutory claims 
in april the appellate court issued an order certifying plaintiff s class action with respect to the tila claims and remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings 
as a result  although it has not yet done so  the trial court may set a trial date to adjudicate those claims 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail in such a trial  they could recover damages of up to  but not to exceed   and their attorneys fees in an amount that would be determined by the trial court 
we believe that the bank has strong defenses to the plaintiffs claims and will prevail at trial 
however  because the trial is likely to be heard before a jury and the outcome of jury trials is inherently uncertain  it is not possible to predict  with any certainty  the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit 
we also are subject to legal actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
currently there are no other pending legal proceedings that we believe will become material to our financial condition or results of operations

dividend policy and share repurchase programs our board of directors has followed the policy of retaining earnings to maintain capital and  thereby  support the growth of the company s banking franchise 
on occasion  the board also considered paying cash dividends out of cash generated in excess of those capital requirements and  in february  the board of directors declared a cash dividend  in the amount of per share of common stock  that was paid on march  the board also has authorized share repurchase programs  in june and in october  when the board concluded that  at prevailing market prices  the company s shares represented an attractive investment opportunity and  therefore  that share repurchases would be a good use of company funds 

table of contents in the first quarter of  the board of directors decided that the prudent course of action  in light of the economic recession  was to preserve cash and earnings to enhance the bank s capital position and to be in a position to take advantage of improved economic and market conditions in the future 
moreover  in july  both the bank and the company entered into a memorandum of understanding an mou with the federal reserve bank of san francisco  their primary federal banking regulator the frb and the california department of financial institutions  the bank s state banking regulator the dfi 
the mou prohibits the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases without the approval of the frb and the dfi 
see item business supervision and regulation pacific mercantile bancorp regulatory action taken by the frb and the dfi 
accordingly  we do not expect to pay dividends or make share purchases at least for the foreseeable future 
restrictions on the payment of dividends cash dividends from the bank represent the principal source of funds available to the bancorp  which it might use to pay dividends or for other corporate purposes  such as expansion of its business 
therefore  government regulations  including the laws of the state of california  as they pertain to the payment of cash dividends by california state chartered banks  limit the amount of funds that would be available to the bancorp to pay cash dividends to our shareholders or fund other expenditures by the bancorp in the future 
in particular  under california law  cash dividends by a california state chartered bank may not exceed  in any calendar year  the lesser of i the sum of its net income for the year and its retained net income from the preceding two years after deducting all dividends paid during the period  or ii the amount of its retained earnings 
additionally  because the payment of cash dividends has the effect of reducing capital  the capital requirements imposed on bank holding companies and commercial banks often operate  as a practical matter  to preclude the payment  or limit the amount of  cash dividends that might otherwise be permitted by california law  and the federal bank regulatory agencies  as part of their supervisory powers  generally require insured banks to adopt dividend policies which limit the payment of cash dividends much more strictly than do applicable state laws 
as previously discussed above  we are prohibited from paying dividends without the prior approval of the frb and the dfi and  accordingly  we do not expect to pay dividends  and we plan to retain any earnings we generate  at least for the foreseeable future 
restrictions on inter company transactions section a of the federal reserve act limits the amounts that a bank may loan to its bank holding company to an aggregate of no more than of the bank subsidiary s capital surplus and retained earnings and requires that such loans be secured by specified assets of the bank holding company see business supervision and regulation restrictions on transactions between the bank and the company and its other affiliates 
we do not have any present intention to obtain any borrowings from the bank

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview forward looking statements the following discussion contains statements which are commonly referred to as forward looking statements which discuss our beliefs or expectations about i operating trends in our markets and in economic conditions more generally  and ii our future financial performance and future financial condition 
the consequences of those operating trends on our business and the realization of our expected future financial results  which are discussed in those forward looking statements  are subject to the uncertainties and risks that are described above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
due to those uncertainties and risks and the uncertainties with respect to the duration and effects of those operating trends on our business  our future financial performance may differ  possibly significantly  from the performance that is currently expected as set forth in the forward looking statements 
as a result  you should not place undue reliance on those forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of the forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is pacific mercantile bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income and assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 

table of contents overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth information comparing our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operations in the years ended december  and year ended december amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands  except per share data interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss per share data diluted net income loss per share diluted weighted average number of diluted shares net of taxes 
as the above table indicates  in we incurred a net loss of million  or per diluted share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in  due primarily to i a decrease in net interest income of nearly million  or  in  as compared to  ii provisions that we had to make for loan losses in totaling nearly million  and iii a million  or increase in noninterest expense  which was only partially offset by a million  increase in non interest income in  as compared to the following provides additional information regarding the significant changes in our operating results in fiscal  which are discussed in greater detail in the discussion that follows this overview 
decrease in net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  despite an increase in lending 
that decrease was primarily the result of a million  or  decline in interest income  only partially offset by a million  or  decrease in interest expense  which were primarily attributable to i a reduction in prevailing market rates of interest resulting from interest rate reductions implemented by the federal reserve board to stimulate the economy and spur borrowings by businesses and consumers  and ii an increase  during fiscal  of million  or  in non performing loans  on which we were required to cease accruing interest 
provision for loan losses 
we made provisions for loan losses in totaling nearly million i to provide for increases in non performing loans and loan write downs and charge offs totaling nearly million that were primarily the result of the economic recession  increases in unemployment  further declines in real property values and a tight credit market  and ii to increase the allowance for loan losses after giving effect to those loan charge offs and write downs  to approximately million  or of outstanding loans  at december  from million  or of outstanding loans  at december   which we believe was prudent in light of prospect that the economic recession  persistent high unemployment  and declines in real estate values would continue until at least the latter half of increase in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to i a million increase in professional fees  primarily as a result of increased legal fees and costs incurred to manage our increased level of non performing loans  ii a million increase in salaries and employee benefits due principally to the addition of credit administrators and mortgage banking personnel  iii a million increase in fdic insurance premiums due to the imposition by the fdic of higher insurance 
table of contents premiums on all federally insured depository institutions  and iv a  increase in expenses incurred in connection with real properties acquired from borrowers on or in lieu of foreclosures commonly referred to as real estate owned or reo 
on the other hand  we increased our non interest income in by million  or  as compared to  due primarily to i a decrease of million in net impairment losses on securities available for sale in as compared to  ii the addition of mortgage banking fees totaling  as a result of the commencement of our mortgage banking operations during  and iii a  increase in transaction fees and service charges 
set forth below are certain key financial performance ratios and other financial data for or at the end of the periods indicated year ended december  return on average assets return on average shareholders equity ratio of average equity to average assets net interest margin net interest income expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets 
changes in financial condition reduction in real estate lending 
to reduce our exposure to the deteriorating conditions in the real estate markets  we have been reducing the volume of single family residential and real estate construction loans since the fourth quarter of  while increasing the volume of commercial and business loans 
as a result  as of december   single family residential and real estate construction loans accounted for of the loans in our loan portfolio  as compared to at december  moreover  in we essentially ceased making new real estate construction loans 
increase in the allowance for loan losses 
as noted above  we increased the allowance for loan losses to million  or of loans outstanding at december   from million  or of loans outstanding at december   to provide for additional loan charge offs that may occur in due to the continuing economic recession 
sale of convertible preferred stock and capital ratios 
although we incurred a net loss of million in  the effect of that loss on our shareholders and tangible book value per share was partially offset by million of equity capital that we raised in the fourth quarter of from the sale  in a private placement to a limited number of sophisticated investors  of series a convertible cumulative preferred stock the series a shares  which are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share 
moreover  although shareholders equity declined by million to million at december   from million at december   the ratio of our consolidated total capital to risk weighted assets  which is the principal federal regulatory measure of the financial strength of banking institutions  was 
as a result  we continued to be classified  under bank regulatory guidelines  as a well capitalized banking institution  which is the highest of the capital standards established under federal banking regulations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and general practices in the banking industry 
certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies  because they require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets 
those estimates and assumptions are made based on current information available to us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances 
if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our estimates or assumptions were based  or other unanticipated events were to occur that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates and to reduce the carrying values of the affected assets on our balance sheet  generally by means of charges against income 

table of contents our critical accounting policies relate to the determination of our allowance for loan losses  the fair value of securities available for sale and the realizability  and hence the valuation  of our deferred tax asset 
allowance for loan losses 
the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining the sufficiency of the allowance we establish for possible loan losses require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market conditions and trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations to us 
accordingly  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current economic and market conditions  other economic indicators and applicable bank regulatory guidelines  to determine the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
if unanticipated changes were to occur in those conditions or trends  or the financial condition of borrowers were to deteriorate  or there were changes to these loss factors or regulatory guidelines  actual loan losses could be greater than those that had previously been predicted 
in such an event  it could become necessary for us to increase the allowance for loan losses by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of the loans on our balance sheet  and the additional provision for loan losses taken to increase that allowance would reduce our income in the period when it is determined that an increase in the allowance for loan losses is necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  federal bank regulatory agencies adopted new and more stringent guidelines and methodologies for identifying losses in bank loan portfolios and determining the sufficiency of loan loss reserves  due to the worsening of the economic recession and the prospects that conditions would not improve during we applied those new guidelines and methodologies beginning in the fourth quarter of and continued applying throughout see the discussion in the subsections entitled provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 
fair value of securities available for sale 
we determine the fair value of our investment securities by obtaining quotes from third party vendors and securities brokers 
when quotes are not available  a reasonable fair value is determined by using a variety of industry standard pricing methodologies including  but not limited to  discounted cash flow analysis  matrix pricing  option adjusted spread models  as well as fundamental analysis 
these pricing methodologies require us to make various assumptions relating to such matters as future prepayment speeds  yield  duration  monetary policy and demand and supply for the individual securities 
consequently  if changes were to occur in the market or other conditions on which those assumptions were based  it could become necessary for us to reduce the fair values of our securities  which would result in changes to accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheet 
if the company determines reductions in the fair values of any securities are other than temporary  it will be necessary for the company to take an impairment loss directly to our income statement 
utilization and valuation of deferred income tax benefits 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for tax credits 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach that considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence  including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income or stockholders equity if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans and ongoing tax planning strategies 
this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected operating performance  our actual results and other factors 
accordingly  we have included the assessment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a critical accounting policy 
our deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance of million  increased to million at december   from million at december  results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is its net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board which affect interest rates  the demand for loans by prospective 
table of contents borrowers  the competition among banks and other lending institutions for loans and deposits and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest income decreased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  decrease in interest income which was only partially offset by a million  or  decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest income in over was due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate earned i on loans to in from in  and ii decrease in the yields on short term investments to in from in those decreases were primarily attributable to interest rate reductions implemented by the federal reserve board during  in response to the economic recession and credit crisis 
those reductions caused interest rates on loans and other interest earning assets to remain at historic lows throughout the average interest rate on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities declined to in from in  primarily due to those same interest rate reductions by the federal reserve board  which enabled us to reduce interest rates on deposits and benefit from reductions in interest rates on our borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin for fiscal decreased to in from in fiscal  because the decrease in interest income exceeded the decrease in interest expense in due primarily to the effects on our interest expense of i an increase in the volume of our deposits  and ii a change in the mix of our deposits to a higher proportion of time deposits  on which we pay higher rates of interest than on other deposits  and a lower proportion of non interest bearing deposits 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest income decreased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of an million  or  decrease in interest income that more than offset a million  or  decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest income in over was due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate earned i on loans to in from in  and ii on short term investments to in from in  primarily as a result of the interest rate reductions implemented by the federal reserve board in response to the worsening economic recession and credit crisis during the average interest rate paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities declined to in from in  primarily due to those same interest rate reductions by the federal reserve board  which enabled us to reduce interest rates on deposits and benefit from reductions in interest rates on our borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin for fiscal decreased to in from in fiscal  as the decrease in interest income exceeded the decrease in interest expense in  because the beneficial impact of the decline in interest rates on our interest expense was partially offset by the effects on interest expense of i an increase in the volume of our deposits and ii a change in the mix of our deposits to a higher proportion of time deposits  on which we pay higher rates of interest than on other deposits  and a lower proportion of non interest bearing deposits

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in interest income  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december   and and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in i the volumes of or in the rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and ii the volumes of or in the rates of interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities

the above table indicates that i the million decline in net interest income in was primarily attributable to declines in interest rates on interest earning assets  which were only partially offset by decreases in interest rates on interest bearing liabilities  and ii the million decrease in net interest income in  was also primarily attributable to declines in interest rates  partially offset by a  increase in net interest income that was attributable to increased loan volume 
provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining an allowance to provide for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced written down to what management believes is its realizable value or  if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value  the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety a loan charge off 
loan charge offs and write downs are charged against that allowance the allowance for loan losses or the all 
the amount of the all is increased periodically i to replenish the all after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs  ii to reflect increases in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential loan losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or adverse changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses below in this item increases in the all are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of operations  referred to as the provision for loan losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to the all and  therefore  have the effect of increasing the all and reducing the amount of the provision that might otherwise have had to be made to replenish or increase the all 

table of contents we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines  industry standards and our own historical loan loss experience  as well as a number of more subjective qualitative factors  to determine both the sufficiency of the all and the amount of the provisions that are required to be made for potential loan losses 
however  those determinations involve judgments about trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us and a weighting among the quantitative and qualitative factors we consider in determining the amount of the all 
moreover  the duration and anticipated effects of prevailing economic conditions or trends can be uncertain and can be affected by number of risks and circumstances that are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors we could incur losses on the loans we make and the discussion below in this item under the caption financial condition nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses 
if changes in economic or market conditions or unexpected subsequent events were to occur  or if changes were made to bank regulatory guidelines or industry standards that are used to assess the sufficiency of the all  it could become necessary to incur additional  and possibly significant  charges to increase the allowance for loan losses  which would have the effect of reducing our income or causing us to incur losses 
in addition  the frb and the dfi  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the adequacy of our all 
these agencies may require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses  over and above the provisions that we have already made  the effect of which would be to reduce our income or increase any losses we might incur 
we made provisions for loan losses in totaling nearly million i to provide for increases in non performing loans and net loan write downs and charge offs totaling nearly million that were primarily the result of the economic recession  increases in unemployment  further declines in real property values and a tight credit market  and ii to increase the allowance for loan losses after giving effect to those loan charge offs and write downs  to approximately million at december  from million at december   which we believe was prudent in light of prospect that the economic recession  persistent high unemployment  and declines in real estate values would continue until at least the latter half of

year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy equipment and depreciation data processing customer expense fdic insurance other real estate owned expenses   n m professional fees other operating expenses total non interest expense other operating expenses primarily consist of telephone  advertising  and investor relations  promotional  business development  and regulatory expenses  insurance premiums and correspondent bank fees 
the increase in noninterest expense in was primarily attributable to i a million increase in professional fees  primarily due to increased legal fees and costs incurred to manage our increased level of non performing loans  which required 
table of contents us to initiate legal proceeding to recover amounts due us by defaulting borrowers  to foreclose real properties and other assets securing non performing loans  and to implement loan restructurings for those borrowers who demonstrated to us an ability to meet their loan obligations on extended or modified terms  ii a million increase in salaries and employee benefits due principally to the addition of mortgage banking personnel and loan administrators  iii a million increase in fdic insurance premiums  due to the imposition by the fdic of substantially higher insurance premiums on all federally insured depository institutions in order to replenish the bank insurance fund which had been depleted by bank failures  and iv a  increase in in expenses incurred in connection with real properties acquired from borrowers on or in lieu of foreclosures 
a measure of our ability to control noninterest expense is our efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expense to net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income 
as a general rule  a lower efficiency ratio indicates an ability to generate increased revenue without a commensurate increase in the staffing and equipment and third party services and  therefore  would be indicative of greater operational efficiencies 
however  a bank s efficiency ratio can be adversely affected by factors such as the opening of new banking offices or  in the bank s case  the commencement  in the second quarter of  of our mortgage banking operations  and increases in fdic insurance premiums 
as a result of the combined effects of the decrease in our net interest income and the increase in noninterest expense in  our efficiency ratio was in  as compared to in and in expense reduction initiatives 
in february  we initiated a number of cost cutting measures that are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and reduce our noninterest expense 
those measures included a work force reduction  a freeze on salaries  elimination of a bonus program for  and suspension of company k plan contributions 
our objective is to reduce noninterest expense by at least in however  there is no assurance that we will achieve that objective  because the amount of our noninterest expense can be affected by events that are outside of our control  such as the costs of managing non performing loans and foreclosing and reselling reo and the amount of the fdic insurance premiums that we are required to pay 
income tax expense benefit due primarily to the pre tax loss we incurred in  our deferred tax assets increased from million at december  to million  net of a valuation allowance of million  at december  we recognized and established the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount we considered to be recoverable after we had made a determination that it had become less likely than not that we would be able to use the tax deductions and tax credit carryforwards comprising the deferred tax assets  in full  prior to their expiration 
the valuation allowance was established by a non cash charge to our statement of operations that was reflected in the income tax benefit recorded for the factors that led us to record a partial valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets are discussed above in critical accounting policies utilization and valuation of deferred income tax benefits of this item and in the notes to consolidated financial statements note  income taxes 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods 
we will continue to monitor available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining deferred tax assets 
if we determine  in the future  that a full recovery of our remaining deferred tax assets has become unlikely  we would record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate may not be recoverable 
our income tax expense or benefit in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases to our valuation allowance 
financial condition assets our total consolidated assets increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december   because we increased our cash and cash equivalents during in order to increase our liquidity in response to the worsening of the economic recession and its impact on california  which has seen significant declines in real property values  increases in real estate foreclosures and sharp increases in unemployment exceeding the national average

investment policy and securities available for sale our investment policy is designed to provide for our liquidity needs and to generate a favorable return on investment without undue interest rate risk  credit risk or asset concentrations 
our investment policy authorizes us to invest in obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the united states government  certain federal agency obligations  time deposits issued by federally insured depository institutions  municipal securities and in federal funds sold  provides that the weighted average maturities of us government obligations and federal agency securities cannot exceed years and municipal obligations cannot exceed years  provides that time deposits that we maintain at other financial institutions must be placed with federally insured financial institutions  cannot exceed the maximum fdic insured amount in any one institution and may not have a maturity exceeding months  and prohibits engaging in securities trading activities 
securities available for sale 
securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but which may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs  in interest rates  or in prepayment risks or other similar factors  are classified as securities available for sale 
such securities are recorded on our balance sheet at their respective fair values and increases or decreases in those values are recorded as unrealized gains or losses  respectively  and are reported as other comprehensive income loss on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet  rather than included in or deducted from our earnings

we perform a quarterly assessment of the securities that have an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in fair value of those securities below their cost is other than temporary 
we adopted asc effective april  and  accordingly  we recognize other than temporary impairment for our available for sale debt securities 
in accordance with asc  when there are credit losses associated with an impaired debt security and i we do not have the intent to sell the security and ii it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  then  we will separate the amount of impairment that is credit related from the amount thereof related to non credit factors 
the credit related impairment is recognized in net gain on sale of securities in the consolidated statements of operations 
the non credit related impairment is recognized and reflected in other comprehensive income 

table of contents through the impairment assessment process  we determined that the investments discussed below were other than temporarily impaired otti at december  we recorded impairment credit losses in earnings on available for sale securities of  for the year ended december  certain of the otti amounts were related to credit losses and recognized in earnings  with the remainder recognized into other comprehensive loss

as of december   the security was rated aaa and a by standard and poor s and moody s  respectively  with negative outlooks  has an amortized cost of million and a fair value of thousand  for an approximate loss of thousand 
the principal collateral for this security is a pool of one to four family  fully amortizing residential first mortgage loans that have a fixed payment for approximately five years  after which they bear interest at variable rates with annual resets 
credit support at december  was approximately and delinquencies days and over totaled approximately 
factors considered in the impairment include the rating change of the security  the current level of subordination from other cmo classes  anticipated prepayment rates  cumulative default rates and the loss severity given a default 
we recognized a  impairment loss with respect to this cmo  constituting a credit loss  in earnings for the year ended december  the remaining loss of  on this security was recognized through other comprehensive loss 
this non credit portion of otti is attributed to external market conditions  primarily the lack of liquidity in these securities and risks of potential additional declines in the housing market 
asset backed securities at december   we had one asset backed security in our portfolio of investment securities available for sale 
this security is a multi class  cash flow collateralized bond obligation backed by a pool of trust preferred securities issued by a diversified pool of issuers consisting of us depository institutions and insurance companies at the time of the security s issuance in november the total amount of this security  as of its issue date  was million 
the security that we own cusip cae is the mezzanine class b piece that floats with month libor basis points and had a rating of aa aa by moody s and fitch at the time of issuance 
we purchased million face value of this security in november at a price of for a total purchase price of as of december  the amortized cost of this security was million with a fair value of  for an approximate unrealized loss of million 
currently  the security has a caa rating from moody s and bb rating with negative outlook from fitch and has experienced million in defaults of total current collateral and million in deferrals of total current collateral from issuance to december as of december   the book value of this security was million with a fair value of  for an approximate unrealized loss of million 
currently  the security has a caa rating from moody s and bb rating with negative outlook from fitch and has experienced million in defaults of total current collateral and million in deferrals of total current collateral from 
table of contents issuance to december we estimate that approximately million of potential additional deferrals and defaults would have to occur approximately of performing collateral before a temporary interest shortfall takes place and that million of deferrals and defaults would have to occur before we would not receive all of the contractual cash flows owed to us 
this analysis takes into account future default rates of  prepayment rates of until maturity  and recovery of future defaults 
we have recognized impairment losses in earnings of  and  in respect of this security for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
impairment losses on otti securities for the twelve months ended december asset backed security non agency cmo as a part of the company s otti assessment  we consider information available about the performance of the underlying collateral  including credit enhancements  default rates  loss severities  delinquency rates  vintage  as well as rating agency reports and historical prepayment speeds 
as a result  significant judgment must be made in connection with our analysis to determine the expected cash flows for its impaired securities 
in determining the component of the otti related to credit losses  we compare the amortized cost basis of each otti security to the present value of its expected cash flows  discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition 
we have made an assessment that we have the ability to continue to hold impaired investment securities 
we have concluded  on the basis of that assessment  along with our evaluation of the future performance of these otti securities  as indicated by the criteria discussed above  that the remainder of our impaired securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
in assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell any impaired security before its anticipated recovery  which may be at their maturity  we consider the significance of each investment  the amount of the impairment  as well as our liquidity position and the impact on our capital position 
based on our analyses  we have concluded that  at december   the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio which impairments have not been recognized are temporary 
loans held for sale during the second quarter of  we commenced a new mortgage banking business that originates residential real estate mortgage loans that qualify for resale into the secondary mortgage markets 
for the year ended december   the bank originated approximately million of conventional and fha va single family mortgage loans and sold approximately million of those loans in the secondary mortgage market 
a total of million of such loans was recorded to the loan portfolio as held for investment 
the loans classified as loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value

table of contents nonperforming loans and allowance for loan losses nonperforming loans 
non performing loans consist of i loans on non accrual status  which include loans restructured when there has not been a history of past performance on debt service in accordance with the contractual terms of the restructured loans  and ii loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
non performing assets consist of non performing loans and oreo  which consists of real properties which have been acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt 
generally  the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than days past due  unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
however  in certain instances  we may place a particular loan on non accrual status earlier  depending upon the individual circumstances involved in loan s delinquency 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income 
subsequent collections of cash are applied as principal reductions when received  except when the ultimate collectibility of principal is probable  in which case interest payments are credited to income 
non accrual loans may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for impaired loans not meeting the criteria for non accrual 
the following table sets forth information regarding nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned which  together  comprise our nonperforming assets  and restructured loans  at december  and december  at december  at december  nonaccrual loans commercial loans commercial real estate residential real estate construction and land development consumer loans total nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo construction and land development residential multi family residential single family commercial real estate total other real estate owned total nonperforming assets restructured loans accruing loans nonaccruing loans included in nonaccrual loans above total restructured loans the increases in non performing loans and oreo were attributable primarily to the continuing economic recession which adversely affected the ability of an increasing number of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations and the tightening of available credit that has prevented such borrowers from refinancing their loans with us 

table of contents loans that have been restructured remain in a non accrual status until there has been six months of satisfactory performance by the borrowers in accordance with the terms of those restructured loans  at which time the loans would be returned to accrual status 
during the year ended december   we entered into troubled debt restructuring agreements with respect to million of loans carried on a non accrual basis 
as a general rule  if such a loan performs in accordance with the terms of its restructuring agreement for that six month period  it will be returned to accrual status 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold two oreo properties with carrying values of million and million  respectively 
no material additional losses were recognized on the sale of either of those properties 
on the other hand  as of december   we were in the process of foreclosing two other properties collateralizing non performing loans with an estimated current market value totaling approximately million 
as a result  we may incur losses on those properties before we can complete their sale 
information regarding impaired loans 
at december   there were million of loans deemed impaired as compared to million at december  we had an average investment in impaired loans for the twelve months ended december  of million as compared to million for the year ended december  the interest that would have been earned during the twelve month period ended december  had the impaired loans in nonaccrual remained current in accordance with their original terms was million 
the following table sets forth the amount of impaired loans for which there is a related allowance for credit losses determined in accordance with asc and the amount of that allowance and the amount of impaired loans for which there is no allowance for credit losses  at december  and december  december  december  dollars in thousands impaired loans loans reserves for loan losses of reserves to loans loans reserves for loan losses of reserves to loans impaired loans with reserves impaired loans without reserves total impaired loans allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses the allowance at december  was million  which represented approximately of the loans outstanding at december   as compared to million  or  of the loans outstanding at december  the adequacy of the allowance is determined through periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other factors that can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations 
those factors are inherently subjective as the process calls for various significant estimates and assumptions 
among other factors  the estimates involve the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and fair value of collateral on impaired loans  estimated losses on loans based on historical loss experience and industry loss factors  various qualitative factors  and uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various loan portfolios  which may be subject to substantial change 
the allowance is first determined by assigning reserve ratios for all loans 
all non accrual loans and other loans classified as special mention  substandard or doubtful classified loans or classification categories are then assigned certain allocations according to type of loans  with greater reserve ratios or percentages applied to loans deemed to be of a higher risk 
these ratios are determined based on prior loss history and industry guidelines and loss factors  by type of loan  adjusted for current economic factors 

table of contents on a quarterly basis  we utilize a classification migration model and individual loan review analysis tools as starting points for determining the adequacy of the allowance 
our loss migration analysis tracks a certain number of quarters of loan loss history and industry loss factors to determine historical losses by classification category for each loan type  except certain loans automobile  mortgage and credit cards  which are analyzed as homogeneous loan pools 
these calculated loss factors are then applied to outstanding loan balances 
we also conduct individual loan review analysis  as part of the allowance allocation process  applying specific monitoring policies and procedures in analyzing the existing loan portfolios 
in determining whether and the extent to which we will make adjustments to our loan loss migration model for purposes of determining the allowance  we also consider a number of qualitative factors that can affect the performance and the collectibility of the loans in our loan portfolio 
such qualitative factors include the effects of changes that we may make in our loan policies or underwriting standards on the quality of the loans and the risks in our loan portfolios  trends and changes in local  regional and national economic conditions  as well as changes in industry specific conditions  and any other reasonably foreseeable events that could affect the performance or the collectibility of the loans in our loan portfolios  material changes that may occur in the mix or in the volume of the loans in our loan portfolios that could alter  whether positively or negatively  the risk profile of those portfolios  changes in management or loan personnel or other circumstances that could  either positively or negatively  impact the application of our loan underwriting standards  the monitoring of nonperforming loans or our loan collection efforts  changes in the concentration of risk in the loan portfolio  and external factors that  in addition to economic conditions  can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  such as fires  earthquakes and terrorist attacks 
determining the effects that these qualitative factors may have on the performance of our loan portfolios requires numerous judgments  assumptions and estimates about conditions  trends and events which may subsequently prove to have been incorrect due to circumstances outside of our control 
moreover  the effects of qualitative factors such as these on the performance of our loan portfolios are often difficult to quantify 
as a result  we may sustain loan losses in any particular period that are sizable in relation to the allowance or that may even exceed the allowance 
in response to the economic recession  which has resulted in increased and relatively persistent high rates of unemployment  and the credit crisis that has led to a severe tightening in the availability of credit  preventing borrowers from refinancing their loans  we have i implemented more stringent loan underwriting standards  ii strengthened loan underwriting and approval processes and iii added personnel with experience in addressing problem assets

as indicated above  loans days or more delinquent increased by million  or  to million at december   from million at december  on the other hand  loans to days delinquent declined by nearly million  or  to million at december   down from million at december  we believe that this decline represents a positive trend which  if it continues  could lead to a decrease in non accrual loans during there is no assurance  however  that such a decrease in non accrual loans will  in fact  occur  as the future direction of the economy and the speed of the economic recovery remain uncertain 
moreover  we are not yet able to determine the impact that this trend may have on our future operating results

we project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain sufficient liquid funds for unanticipated events 
our primary sources of cash include i payments on loans  and ii the sale or maturity of investments  iii growth in deposits  and iv borrowings 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on our customers lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding deposit withdrawals  reducing outstanding borrowings and paying operating expenses 
we maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
we also have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions which can be drawn upon to meet any additional liquidity requirements 
as of december   we had unused borrowing capacity of million with the federal home loan bank 
our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank frb and federal home loan bank fhlb stock totaled million or of total assets at december   as compared to million or of total assets at december  cash flow used in operating activities 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash in operating activities  primarily to fund the net loss of million  partially offset by adjustments for non cash expenses 

table of contents cash flow used in investing activities 
in the year ended december   we used cash flow of million in investing activities  primarily to fund a net increase in securities available for sale and an increase in loans 
cash flow provided by financing activities 
cash flow of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   the source of which consisted primarily of a net increase of million in deposits  which was partially offset by a million net decrease in borrowings  consisting of paydowns on fhlb debt 
the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides a useful measure of our liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields and higher interest income on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on assets 
at december   the ratio of loans to deposits was  compared to at december  off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  we had outstanding commitments to fund loans totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made can be as much as the amount of those commitments assuming amounts drawn by customer total of their commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were approving loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
as a consequence  our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future

junior subordinated debentures 
pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies are permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that will  subject to certain conditions  qualify as and  therefore  augment capital for regulatory purposes 
pursuant to those rulings  in  we formed subsidiary grantor trusts to sell and issue to institutional investors a total of million principal amount of floating junior trust preferred securities trust preferred securities
