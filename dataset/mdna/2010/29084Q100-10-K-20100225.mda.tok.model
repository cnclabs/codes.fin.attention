the operating income of our canada construction and facilities services segment also improved in compared to the improvement in operating margin in  when compared to  was in large part due to the increase in the gross profit margin in our domestic construction segments  as well as improved operating performance by our international operations 
the increase in the gross profit margin in  when compared to  was primarily the result of a improved margins within our united states electrical construction and facilities services segment as a result of the favorable resolution of uncertainties on projects nearing or at completion  b the turnaround in the performance of one of our operations  which had experienced large operating losses in  within our united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment and c the improved performance of our international operations 
these increases were partially offset by lower gross profit margin in our united states facilities services segment  primarily as a result of lower margins from our industrial services operations 
cash flows provided by operating activities of million in increased  when compared to  due to a reduction in our outstanding accounts receivable balances and other changes in our working capital 
we completed one acquisition during for an immaterial amount 
the acquired company  which provides mobile mechanical services  has been included in our united states facilities services segment and expands our service capabilities in a geographical area in which we had been already operating

backlog decreases as we perform work on existing contracts and increases with awards of new contracts 
the decrease in backlog as of december   compared to such backlog at december   in our united states electrical construction and facilities services and our united states mechanical construction and facilities services segments is primarily attributable to a decrease in contracts awarded for work in the commercial  hospitality  transportation and industrial markets  although the decrease was partially offset by increased awards of institutional and healthcare projects 
backlog is not a term recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles  however  it is a common measurement used in our industry 
backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of facilities services contracts 
however  if the remaining term of a facilities services contract exceeds months  the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only the next months of revenues

the terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies surety companies and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts 
the surety bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts  and we have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts  if any  paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees  surety bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
public sector contracts require surety bonds more frequently than private sector contracts  and accordingly  our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases 
as of december   based on our percentage of completion of our projects covered by surety bonds  our aggregate estimated exposure  had there been defaults on all our existing contractual obligations  would have been approximately billion 
the surety bonds are issued by surety companies in return for premiums  which vary depending on the size and type of bond 
in recent years  there has been a reduction in the aggregate surety bond issuance capacity of surety companies due to the economy and the regulatory environment 
consequently  the availability of surety bonds has become more limited and the terms upon which surety bonds are available have become more restrictive 
we continually monitor our available limits of surety bonds and discuss with our current and other surety bond providers the amount of surety bonds that may be available to us based on our financial strength and the absence of any default by us on any surety bond we have previously obtained 
however  if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are further changes in the surety industry  we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for surety bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of surety bonds such as letters of credit or guarantees by emcor group  inc  by seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement for surety bonds  by increasing our activities in business segments that rarely require surety bonds such as the facilities services segment  and or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require surety bonds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectuate alternatives to providing surety bonds to our customers or to obtain  on favorable terms  sufficient additional work that does not require surety bonds to replace projects requiring surety bonds that we may decline to pursue 
accordingly  if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of surety bonds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
we do not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein 
our primary source of liquidity has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
we also maintain the revolving credit facility  which has been replaced with a new credit facility expiring in february  that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
however  negative macroeconomic trends may have an adverse effect on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  our focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns inasmuch as a part of our facilities services business is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during past economic downturns  there were typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector  and companies like us aggressively bid larger long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically requires working capital until initial billing milestones are achieved 
while we strive to maintain a net over billed position with our customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained 
our net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities and our revolving credit facility 
based upon our current credit ratings and financial position  we can reasonably expect to be able to incur long term debt to fund acquisitions 
over the long term  our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in addition  our ability to perform work is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
we believe that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available through borrowings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet our expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
if we were required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
certain insurance matters as of december  and  we utilized approximately million and million  respectively  of letters of credit issued obtained under our revolving credit facility as collateral for insurance obligations 
new accounting pronouncements we review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact  if any  that the adoption of such standards will have 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  there were no new accounting standards that were projected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity
