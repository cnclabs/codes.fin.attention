item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss of million 
after the effective dividend of 
million to the treasury on preferred stock  the net loss to common shareholders was million 
on a per share basis  the net loss was per common share while the return on average assets and return on average equity was negative and respectively 
the loss in was primarily due to the addition of million in provisions for future loan losses given the level of non performing loans and charges totaling million in impairment losses on securities 
also impacting the loss in was a decrease of million in interest income due to increasing non performing loans  decreasing interest rates and the loss of over million in income from fnma and fhlmc preferred stock dividends which were suspended after they were placed in conservatorship in total assets declined million at december  to million from million at december  total cash and cash equivalents increased million to million as total deposits increased million  total loans decreased million  securities available for sale decreased million  and total borrowings decreased million from million in to million in much of the increase in deposits is attributable to the popularity of the company s dream checking product which offered an above market interest rate for accounts which met certain monthly benchmarks for automated transactions such as debit card usage and automatic deposits 
the increase in interest bearing demand deposits of million accounted for of the total increase in deposits 
these funds  as well as the funds received from the sale  maturity  and calls of investment securities allowed the company to pay down its borrowings and better position the balance sheet for the future 
at december   the book value of a share of common stock was compared to at december  for the year ended december  the company reported a net loss of million compared to net income of million reported for the year ended december   a decline of million or 
the loss is attributed to the company s recordation of an million non cash charge related to perpetual preferred stock issued by fannie mae and freddie mac collectively  the gse and the effect of the write off of a million debt security resulting from the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers holding  inc during the third and fourth quarters of at december  total assets were million  growth of million or from million at year end comparing the major components of the company s balance sheet at year end and finds cash and funds sold were versus million  investment securities were versus million  loans were versus million  other assets were versus million  deposits were versus million  borrowings were versus million and total shareholder s equity was versus million 
at december   the book value of a share of common stock was versus in the company s return on average equity was negative and in and respectively and in the return on average assets amounted to negative and in and respectively and in net interest income 
in  the company s net interest income was million compared to million in and million in interest and fees on loans decreased in from as the amount of non accrual loans rose from million at december  to million at december  the amount of interest income lost on these loans was approximately  in the yield on loans fell to in from in as variable rate loans which priced downward several times in went lower in and remained at that low rate for the rest of the year 
interest income on securities decreased million from million in to million in this is the result of the calls on many higher yielding agency securities during as well as the previously mentioned loss of the gse dividends 
as the yields on loans and investments were decreasing  so too were the rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
interest expense on deposits decreased million or in compared to interest expense on borrowings decreased million from million in to million in while the cost of these funds dropped from in to in in  the company s net interest income was million  compared to million in the principal reasons for the decline in the net interest margin in from was margin compression  the write off of gse investments  costs for retail deposits and interest rate cuts by the federal reserve bank 
the lower net interest income for was anticipated  and is reflected in the basis point decline in the net interest margin due to the company s asset sensitivity and the prevailing interest rate environment 
following a period of stable rates throughout the early part of  the federal reserve made three cuts in the fourth quarter of and continued reducing rates with seven cuts totaling basis points during  causing interest income to decline by a higher percentage than in our interest expense and resulting in compression of our net interest margin 
this compression is further impacted by the company s asset sensitivity  as there are more earning assets tied to variable interest rates than there are variable rate deposits or borrowings 
for example  the cost of interest paid on certificates of deposit  the company s most significant funding source  does not immediately decline when interest rates are cut  whereas the income on loans tied to prime or other variable indices does 
some of the margin compression effect was mitigated by the increases in the volume of earning assets  principally loans 
earning assets for averaged million  an increase of million or compared to million in the decrease in net interest income for versus of  or resulted from the decrease of million or in interest income which totaled million versus  in  this decline exceeded the reduction of  or in interest expense which totaled  versus million in in spite of the million increase in the average volume of earning assets  due to the interest rate cuts throughout the first  second and fourth quarters of  the yield on earning assets declined by basis points to from the prior year s  while over the same period  the expense yield on interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points to from in this situation where yields fall on interest bearing liabilities at a slower pace than they did on earning assets results from interest rate cuts that are not fully reflected in retail deposit pricing due to a competitive environment where the costs of deposits were at artificially high levels not reflective of the current cost environment and older certificates of deposit renewing at these higher market rates which negatively impacts the net interest margin of an asset sensitive financial institution

this offset a decline in the earnings from the title insurance subsidiary 
non interest income for was relatively unchanged as it decreased  or  totaling million compared to million in deposit fees and charges were million compared to million  an increase of due to a higher volume of overdraft fees as there were no modifications to deposit service charges during bank card fees were  a increase over the prior year s  the higher revenue was due to an increase in fee based income from debit card usage and point of sale transaction fees that offset a decline in interchange credits 
the increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance totaled  versus  an increase of  or as a result of higher net crediting rates paid by the insurance companies 
mortgage loan secondary market fees declined from  to  in due to the continued strategy of recording on the bank s books a percentage of mortgages underwritten rather than selling all of them in the secondary market  coupled with the continued decline in the mortgage origination business to the economic factors 
investment and insurance commissions generated by the non deposit investment product sales program totaled  versus  a decrease of  or  due to a significantly lower volume of transactions in the third and fourth quarters as a direct result of the economic events beginning in september realized gains on securities available for sale totaled  compared to  in  an increase of  or as a result of active portfolio management  gains on securities purchased at a discount being called at par  or in the case of municipals a premium call price  and sales generating liquidity to partially fund loan growth

the largest portion of this expense in each year was the loss on otti write down of securities which totaled million in compared to million in excluding otti  non interest expense increased  or in federal insurance premiums fdic increased  or in to million 
this is primarily due to a special assessment of  expensed in the second quarter as well as premium rate increases in in addition  data processing is a new expense category in  which represents the company s change in late to an outsourced arrangement for data processing  replacing an in house system

the company is an active residential mortgage and residential construction lender and generally extends commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses within its primary service area 
the company s commercial lending activity extends across its primary service area of powhatan  cumberland  eastern goochland county  western chesterfield  and western henrico counties 
consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  the company generally does not attempt to diversify its loan portfolio geographically by making significant amounts of loans to borrowers outside of its primary service area 
the principal economic risk associated with each of the categories of loans in the company s portfolio is the creditworthiness of its borrowers 
within each category  such risk is increased or decreased depending on prevailing economic conditions 
the risk associated with the real estate mortgage loans and installment loans to individuals varies based upon employment levels  consumer confidence  fluctuations in value of residential real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of consumers to repay indebtedness 
the risk associated with commercial  financial and agricultural loans varies based upon the strength and activity of the local economies of the company s market areas 
the risk associated with real estate construction loans varies based upon the supply of and demand for the type of real estate under construction 
many of the company s real estate construction loans are for pre sold or contract homes 
builders are limited as to the number and dollar amount of loans for speculative home construction based on the financial strength of the borrower and the prevailing market conditions

the company has focused much of its efforts on increasing its commercial and industrial loans for several years  as a desirable alternative to real estate related construction lending

instead those loans which met the bank s underwriting criteria were recorded on the bank s books as mortgage loans 
in addition  most of these loans were and year fixed rate loans  which given the composition of bank s portfolio of mortgage loans being mostly and year adjustable rate loans  the addition of fixed rate loans was desirable from an asset liability standpoint at a time when interest rates were flat and expected to trend down in the future 
as a percentage of total real estate loans  construction loans comprised in  in  in  in  and in considering the current state of the real estate market for new home sales  the company anticipates that its construction loan portfolio will remain at approximately the same volume or will decline in the future 
substantially all construction loans are for residential construction in the principal markets served by the company 
installment loans decreased by million or in  decreased by thousand or in  declined by thousand or in  and declined by million or in the balances of traditional installment loans declined primarily due to reduced demand resulting from the current economic environment 
installment loans increased in due to the company s emphasis on loan growth  however over the past several years  the balances have dropped principally due to the company s unwillingness to effectively compete on an interest rate basis with the captive and other finance arms of the major automobile manufacturers  coupled with the tendency of consumers to utilize equity credit lines for purposes that in the past would have been financed with traditional installment loans 
the company anticipates this atmosphere surrounding installment lending to continue in the future as long as the automobile manufacturers effectively subsidize the sale of vehicles through offering below market financing 
all concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans at december  were disclosed as a separate category of loans

non performing loans include non accrual loans  loans days or more past due and restructured loans 
non accrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been discontinued 
loans which reach non accrual status  per company policy  may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and interest has been paid  or the loan becomes both well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans are loans with respect to which a borrower has been granted a concession on the interest rate or the original repayment terms because of financial difficulties 
non performing loans totaled million at december   versus million at december   million at december   million at december   and  at december  non performing loans increased by million in from as the current economic downturn continued to affect the ability of some of our borrowers to repay their loans 
management forecloses on delinquent real estate loans when all other repayment possibilities have been exhausted

there was no oreo at december    or the bank had net oreo related expenses totaling in of  and in   of the same expense 
as the bank had no oreo during   or  the bank had no period expenses related to oreo 
the bank s practice is to value real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lower of i an independent current appraisal or market analysis less anticipated costs of disposal  or ii the existing loan balance 
management is diligently monitoring the increase in non performing assets  however  it does not believe that the level of non performing loans in is reflective of any significant systemic problem within the company s loan portfolio and rather is a reflection of the current depressed real estate markets and the generally weak economic environment 
at december   there were in non accrual loans compared to in non accrual loans at december  and million at december    at december   and  at december  based on our present knowledge of the status of individual and corporate borrowers and the overall state of the local economy  management reasonably anticipates that the level of non performing assets is likely to increase from its current level  however not by the same degree of increase experienced in over management will move to foreclose on borrowers whose loans are placed on a non accrual status in order to resolve the credit therefore it is reasonable to anticipate an increase in oreo 
the following table summarizes non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis loans contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments not included in non accrual loans above loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms not included in non accrual loans or loans contractually past due days or more above total non performing loans other real estate owned other non performing assets total non performing assets loans days or more past due generally  are placed on non accrual status unless well secured and in the process of collection 
the company s policy with respect to past due interest on nonaccrual loans requires that any interest accrued in the current year and unpaid should be reversed from the receivable and current year s income 
with regard to interest accrued in the prior year  and yet unpaid  such accrued interest should be reversed from the receivable and reserve for loan losses

the impact of both the reversal of previously accrued but unpaid interest plus the absence of subsequent accruals on loans in non accrual status had the effect of reducing net income by  in   in  and  in since the company operates in a rural to suburban area  it has generally been well acquainted with its principal borrowers and has not had such a large number of problem credits that management has not been able to stay well informed about  and in contact with  troubled borrowers 
management is not aware of any other material loans at december   which involve significant doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with their existing payment terms

loans  including non performing loans are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the company s periodic loan review process 
management reviews the adequacy of its loan loss allowance at the end of each month 
based primarily on the company s loan risk classification system  which classifies all commercial loans  including problem credits as substandard  doubtful  or loss  according to a scale of with being a loss  additional provisions for losses may be made monthly 
in addition  the company evaluates the general market credit risks inherent in lending  as well as any systemic issues  as part of its enhanced loan loss adequacy analysis 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at december   at december   at december   at december  and at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses  while not increasing at the same rate as the loan portfolio grows  is nevertheless adequate to provide for future losses 
at december   the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans was  at december  the ratio was  at december  the ratio was  at december  the ratio was  and at december  the ratio stood at

management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of local business and economic conditions  changes in the nature and value of the portfolio  industry standards and other relevant factors 
assumptions and factors considered by management in determining the amounts charged to operations include internally generated loan review reports  previous loan loss experience with the borrower  the status of past due interest and principal payments on the loan  the quality of financial information supplied by the borrower and the general financial condition of the borrower 
despite management s best efforts  the reserve may be adjusted in future periods if there are significant changes in the assumptions or factors utilized when making valuations  or conditions differ materially from the assumptions originally utilized 
any such adjustments are made in the reporting period when the relevant factor s become known and when applied as part of the analysis indicate a change in the level of potential loss is warranted 
for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  and in the provision for loan losses was  there was a  provision for loan losses for the year ended december   while in there was no loan provision  and in the provision was  in management s opinion  the provision charged to operations has been sufficient to absorb the current year s net loan losses and generally provide a reserve for potential future loan losses considering the financial condition of borrowers and collateral values in view of the uncertainties in our local economy

the company has allocated the allowance according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within each of the above categories of loans 
the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions or that the allocation indicates future loss trends 
furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category may vary from period to period due to changes in the financial ability of borrowers to service their debt and repay principal  changes in the estimated value of collateral  in particular real estate 
these allocations are not necessarily the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories  since a portion of the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire portfolio 
securities the company s investment securities portfolio serves several purposes  primarily  liquidity  safety and yield 
certain of the securities are pledged to secure public deposits and others are specifically identified as collateral for borrowing from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  and others for repurchase agreements with correspondent banks and commercial customers 
the remaining portion of the portfolio is held for investment yield  availability for sale in the event liquidity is needed  and for general asset liability management purposes 
at december   investment securities totaled million representing of total assets and a decrease of million or compared to million in the majority of this decrease occurred in the government agencies category as over million of these securities were called during while the net of purchases and sales was a positive million as the company sought to replace the yield on the securities called 
for the total portfolio in  million in securities were called  net purchases and sales were a positive million  paydowns and maturities were million  and million was written down as otti 
at year end december   total investment securities were million representing of total assets  and a decrease of million or versus the year ended december  balance of million 
this is largely due to the million write off of gse and lehman investments and the adjustment to market value from book value of the securities by its associated fasb unrealized losses 
total investment securities at year end were million or of total assets  as compared to the prior year s december  balance of million

during the year purchases of securities totaled million as securities were called due to declining rates throughout the year  calls totaled million  sales were million  maturities were million  paydowns were million 
as previously mentioned  the impairment write downs of the gse preferred stock and the lehman bond had a significant impact on earnings 
however  in addition  the loss of over million in earning assets has placed further stress on the company s net interest income and net interest margin as there was no immediate corresponding reduction in funding for the million decline in securities 
the company reviews and evaluates all securities quarterly or more frequently as necessary for possible impairment 
if  in the judgment of management  there is serious doubt as to the probability of collecting substantially all the company s basis in a security within a reasonable period of time  an impairment write down will be recognized 
the company presently holds the following securities with credit ratings that  subsequent to purchase  have declined below minimum investment grade thousand gmac perpetual preferred stock  million mbia global funding maturing  million citigroup maturing  million bank boston capital maturing  million bank of america capital 
maturing  million sallie mae senior debt maturing and million in sallie mae preferred stock 
following the quarterly evaluation of these securities  management has concluded that  as of december  the impairment is considered temporary 
additionally  the company holds ten cdo securities totaling approximately million book value at december  where the underlying pooled collateral is various bank and insurance company trust preferred debt 
other than temporary impairment otti in the amount of million has been recognized on six of these securities in subsequent to purchase  three of these securities have revised ratings that are below minimum investment grade refer to note of the financial statements for further discussion 
the total estimated market value of these securities at december  was approximately million 
four of these securities have had impairment recognized  another four of these securities are performing as designed and are current with all cash flows 
when impairment reviews were conducted quarterly for all cdo securities  if the bond was performing and current with its cash flows  and the analysis indicated that substantially all principal would be recovered by maturity  the impairment was considered to be due to market conditions and therefore temporary

the company s deposit base is comprised of demand deposits  savings and money market accounts and other time deposits 
the company s deposits are provided by individuals and businesses generally located within the principal markets served 
more recently  as the company has grown its earning assets  it has found it to be financially advantageous to rely to a greater extent on wholesale borrowings than retail deposits 
wholesale funding tends to be much easier to obtain  more reliable  and quite often cheaper than retail deposits 
since deposits are  for our purposes  functionally similar to other forms of borrowing  there is not a significant difference between retail deposits and wholesale borrowings in so far as funding sources for earning assets are concerned 
management will emphasize one or the other depending on the costs of each and its outlook as to the future direction of interest rates 
as shown in the following table  average total deposits increased by in  compared to a decline in and an increase in the average aggregate interest rate paid on deposits was in  versus in  and in the majority of the company s deposits are higher yielding time deposits because many of its customers are individuals who seek higher yields than those offered on savings and demand accounts 
the following table is a summary of average deposits and average rates paid average balance interest paid average rate average balance interest paid average rate average balance interest paid average rate non interest bearing demand interest bearing demand savings certificates of deposit total the company does not solicit nor does it have any brokered deposits 
due to its adequately capitalized status  the company is not permitted to accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval or offer interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the average rates in its market area 
the following table is a summary of time deposits of  or more by remaining maturities at december  time deposits  dollars in thousands three months or less three to six months six to twelve months over twelve months capital resources the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality  liquidity  earnings performance and changing competitive conditions and economic forces 
the company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to support its growth and expansion activities  to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence 
the bank was considered adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes as of december  the primary indicators relied on by the federal reserve board and other bank regulators in measuring strength of capital position are the tier capital  total capital  and leverage ratios 
tier capital consists of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity and minority interests in common equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
total capital consists of tier capital  qualifying subordinated debt  some hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses and pre tax net unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  which consist of both on and off balance sheet risks 
the bank s tier capital ratio was as of december   compared to as of december   as of december   and at december  the total capital ratio was at december   compared to at december   at december   and at december  these ratios are in excess of the mandated minimum requirements of for tier  and for total 
the leverage ratio consists of tier capital divided by quarterly average assets 
at december  the bank s leverage ratio was compared to at december   at december  and at december  each of these exceeds the required minimum leverage ratio of 
due to the impact on the bank s capital ratios of the write down of the gse investments during and as well as the increase in provision for loan losses in the company may raise additional capital in the future 
at this time  the company does not know what the nature of any capital raise will be  but expects that it could be substantially dilutive to current shareholders the following tables show risk based capital ratios and stockholders equity to total assets for the company and its principal subsidiary  central virginia bank december  regulatory minimum consolidated for capital adequacy purposes total risk based capital tier risk based capital leverage ratio stockholders equity to total assets n a central virginia bank adequately capitalized well capitalized total risk based capital tier risk based capital leverage ratio the capital management function is an ongoing process 
central to this process is internal equity generation accomplished by retaining earnings 
the losses incurred in and have reduced the capital such that it is now considered adequately capitalized 
at december   total stockholders equity increased million principally due to the issuance of preferred shares in january total stockholders equity decreased by million to million in from million in principally due to write down  net of tax  of the gse and lehman brothers securities and an increase in the unrealized securities losses  net of tax  reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
total stockholders equity decreased by million to million in from million principally due to an increase in the unrealized securities losses  net of tax  reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
by contrast  shareholders equity increased by million in as a result of earnings retention and a decrease in the unrealized securities losses  net of tax  reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in january  the company elected to participate in the tarp capital purchase program and issued  of cumulative senior preferred stock to the us treasury 
this additional capital partially replaced the reduction in capital as a result of the million impairment write downs in the cost of the senior preferred dividend is approximately  annually 
total cash dividends on common stock of  were paid in  compared  in   paid in and  in book value per common share was at december  compared to at december   at december   and at december  the company s principal source of cash income is dividend payments from the bank 
certain limitations exist under applicable law and regulation by regulatory agencies regarding dividend payments to a parent by its subsidiaries 
as a result of the losses reported for and  as of december   without prior regulatory approval  the bank would not have had sufficient retained earnings available for distribution to the company as dividends 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing within one year 
the company s ability to obtain deposits and purchase funds at favorable rates determines its liability liquidity 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and its ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
additional sources of liquidity available to the company include  but are not limited to  loan repayments  the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates  borrowing from the federal home loan bank  purchasing of federal funds from correspondent banks  and selling securities under repurchase agreements to correspondent banks as well as commercial customers 
to further meet its liquidity needs  the company also has access to the federal reserve system 
in the past  growth in deposits and proceeds from the maturity of investment securities has been sufficient to fund the net increase in assets 
more recently  the bank has relied on wholesale borrowings as they are a much more effective and less expensive form of funding 
the bank  over the past five years  has experienced growth in average year to date deposits from million in to million in during the same period  the bank has increased its borrowings from an average of million for to an average of million for finally over the same five year period the bank increased its assets by from an average of million for to an average of million for interest rate sensitivity 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management must also control the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
managing this risk involves regular monitoring of the interest sensitive assets relative to interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals 
at december   the company had a positive month and a negative month period gap position  the cumulative gap to the one year point was negative 
since the largest amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities mature or reprice within months  the company monitors this area closely 
the company does not emphasize interest sensitivity analysis beyond this time frame because it believes various unpredictable factors could result in erroneous interpretations 
early withdrawal of deposits  prepayments of loans and loan delinquencies are some of the factors that could have such an effect 
in addition  changes in rates on interest sensitive assets and liabilities may not be equal  which could result in a change in net interest margin 
while the company does not match each of its interest sensitive assets against specific interest sensitive liabilities  it does seek to enhance the net interest margin while minimizing exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
effects of inflation inflation significantly affects industries having high proportions of fixed assets or high levels of inventories 
although the company is not significantly affected in these areas  inflation does have an impact on the growth of assets 
as assets grow rapidly  it becomes necessary to increase equity capital at proportionate levels to maintain the appropriate equity to asset ratios 
traditionally  the company s earnings and high capital retention levels have enabled the company to meet these needs 
the company s reported earnings results have been affected by inflation  but isolating the effect is difficult 
the different types of income and expense are affected in various ways 
interest rates are affected by inflation  but the timing and magnitude of the changes may not coincide with changes in the consumer price index 
management actively monitors interest rate sensitivity  as illustrated by the gap analysis  in order to minimize the effects of inflationary trends on interest rates 
other areas of non interest expenses may be more directly affected by inflation

off balance sheet arrangements the company enters into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these off balance sheet arrangements include unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which would impact the company s liquidity and capital resources to the extent customer s accept and or use these commitments 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature  business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off balance sheet arrangements 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources  that is material to investors

critical accounting policies general 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we may use historical loss factors as one of the many factors and estimates utilized in determining the inherent losses that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
a summary of the significant accounting policies of the company is set forth in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be appropriate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge offs  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay and the value of collateral  overall portfolio quality and specific potential losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
impairment of loans we measure impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
we maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
impairment of securities impairment of investment securities results in a write down that must be included in net income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
we regularly review each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market price  the duration of that market decline  the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer and our ability and intention with regard to holding the security to maturity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general an important element of both earnings performance and liquidity is the management of our interest sensitive assets and our interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within specific time intervals and the risks involved with them 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments in response to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee at the bank is comprised of the ceo  cfo  senior credit officer and an independent director  and is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposures to this risk 
our board of directors reviews the guidelines established by the committee 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of four complimentary modeling tools static gap analysis  dynamic gap simulation modeling  earnings simulation modeling and economic value simulation net present value estimation 
each of the three simulation models measure changes under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
while each of the interest rate risk measures has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap  which measures aggregate repricing values  is less utilized or relied upon  since it does not effectively capture or measure the optionality characteristics of earning assets and funding sources nor does it effectively measure the earnings impact of changes in volumes and mix of these components on us 
earnings simulation and economic value models  however  which more effectively reflect the earnings impact  are utilized by management on a regular basis 
earnings simulation analysis we use simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the model utilized by the company calculates estimated earnings based on projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process  but it provides a more realistic analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analysis such as the static gap analysis 
assumptions used in the model  including loan and deposit growth rates  are derived from seasonal trends and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project the yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are accounted for in the different rate scenarios 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income net interest income at risk on a month horizon using different rate scenarios as of december  there have been no material changes in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since this information was developed using december  data 
change in yield curve cumulative percentage change in net interest income from base cumulative dollar change in net interest income from base dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points base  basis points basis points basis points economic value simulation we use economic value simulation to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities under different interest rate environments 
economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities 
the change in economic value of equity over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term repricing risk in the balance sheet 
the same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation 
the following chart reflects the change in net market value of equity  economic value of equity at risk  by using december  data  over different rate environments with a one year horizon 
change in yield curve dollars in thousands cumulative percentage change in economic value of equity cumulative dollar change in economic value of equity dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points base  basis points basis points basis points management of the interest sensitivity gap the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time interval 
the gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling investment securities  replacing an earning asset or funding liability prior to maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net income due to changes in market interest rates 
we evaluate interest rate risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to modify sensitivity risk 
these guidelines are based upon management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
our asset liability management committee reviews deposit pricing  changes in borrowed money  investment and trading activity  loan sale activities  liquidity levels and the company s overall interest sensitivity 
the minutes of the committee are reported to the board of directors regularly 
the periodic monitoring of interest rate risk  investment and trading activity  deposit pricing  funding and liquidity  along with any other significant transactions are managed by the chief financial officer of the bank with input from other committee members 
the following table summarizes the company s dynamic gap model
