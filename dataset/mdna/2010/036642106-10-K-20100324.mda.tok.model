manufacturing we do not have the facilities or capabilities to commercially manufacture any of our products and product candidates 
we have no current plans to establish a manufacturing facility 
we expect that we will be dependent to a significant extent on contract manufacturers for commercial scale manufacturing of our product candidates in accordance with regulatory standards 
contract manufacturers may utilize their own technology  technology developed by us  or technology acquired or licensed from third parties 
when contract manufacturers develop proprietary process technology  our reliance on such contract manufacturers is increased 
technology transfer from the original contract manufacturer may be required 
any such technology transfer may also require transfer of requisite data for regulatory purposes  including information contained in a proprietary drug master file dmf held by a contract manufacturer 
fda approval of the new manufacturer and manufacturing site would also be required 
we have contracted with a commercial supplier of pharmaceutical chemicals to supply us with the active pharmaceutical ingredient of oxybutynin for clinical quantities of anturol in a manner that meets fda requirements via reference to their dmf for oxybutynin 
we have contracted with patheon  inc patheon  a manufacturing development company  to supply clinical quantities of anturol gel in a manner that may meet fda requirements 
the fda has not approved the manufacturing processes for anturol at patheon at this time 
we have completed commercial scale up activities associated with anturol manufacturing required for the nda 
we are responsible for us device manufacturing in compliance with current quality system regulations qsr established by the fda and by the centralized european regulatory authority medical device directive 
injector and disposable parts are manufactured by third party suppliers and are assembled by a third party supplier for our needle free device for all of our partners 
packaging is performed by a third party supplier under our direction 
product release is performed by us 
we have contracted with nypro inc nypro  an international manufacturing development company to supply commercial quantities of our vibex pressure assisted auto injector device in compliance with fda qsr regulations 
sales and marketing we expect to currently market most of our products through other more established pharmaceutical companies while continuing marketing of our insulin injection devices and related disposable components in the us in the future and as we develop more products in niche therapeutic areas  we will consider developing commercial capabilities

for competitive reasons  our partners may not divulge their name  the product name or the exact stage of clinical development 
in june  we granted an exclusive license to biosante to develop and commercialize three of our gel technology products and one patch technology product for use in hormone replacement therapy in north america and other countries 
subsequently  the license for the patch technology product was returned to us in exchange for a fourth gel based product 
biosante paid us million upon execution of the agreement and is also required to make royalty payments once commercial sales of the products have begun 
the royalty payments are based on a percentage of sales of the products and must be paid for a period of years following the first commercial sale of the products  or when the last patent for the products expires  whichever is later 
the agreement also provides for milestone payments to us upon the occurrence of certain events related to regulatory filings and approvals 
in november  biosante entered into a sublicense and marketing agreement with bradley pharmaceuticals  inc bradley for elestrin formerly bio e gel 
biosante received an upfront payment from bradley which triggered a payment to us of  in december  the fda approved elestrin for marketing in the united states triggering payments to us totaling million  which were received in we also received royalties on sales of elestrin 
bradley was acquired by nycomed inc in february and returned elestrin to biosante 
in december  elestrin was sublicensed to azur pharmaceuticals azur and subsequently relaunched in as a result of the sublicense agreement with azur  we received payments from biosante of  in december in addition  we will receive royalties on sales of elestrin as well as potential sales based milestone payments 
in january  we entered into a revised license agreement with ferring  under which we licensed certain of our intellectual property and extended the territories available to ferring for use of certain of our reusable needle free injection devices to include all countries and territories in the world except asia pacific 
specifically  we granted to ferring an exclusive  royalty bearing license  within a prescribed manufacturing territory  to utilize certain of our reusable needle free injector devices for the field of hgh until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents in any country in the territory 
we granted to ferring similar non exclusive rights outside of the prescribed manufacturing territory 
in addition  we granted to ferring a non exclusive right to make and have made the equipment required to manufacture the licensed products  and an exclusive  royalty free license in a prescribed territory to use and sell the licensed products under certain circumstances 
in  we amended this agreement providing for non exclusive rights in asia along with other changes to financial terms of the agreement 
in  jcr initiated a campaign to broaden its marketing efforts for human growth hormone under a purchase agreement with our needle free injector 
in november  we signed an agreement with sicor pharmaceuticals inc  an affiliate of teva  under which sicor is obligated to purchase all of its injection delivery device requirements from us for an undisclosed product to be marketed in the united states 
sicor also received an option for rights in other territories 
the license agreement included  among other things  an upfront cash payment  milestone fees  a negotiated purchase price for each device sold  and royalties on sales of their product 
in july  we entered into an exclusive license development and supply agreement with sicor pharmaceuticals inc  an affiliate of teva 
pursuant to the agreement  the affiliate is obligated to purchase all of its delivery device requirements from us for an undisclosed product to be marketed in the united states and canada 
we received an upfront cash payment  and will receive milestone fees  a negotiated purchase price for each device sold  as well as royalties on sales of their product 
in december  this agreement was amended to include development work that was outside the scope of the original agreement  resulting in additional payments to us 
in the agreement was again amended providing for payment of capital equipment and other development work 
in july  we entered into a joint development agreement with the population council  an international  non profit research organization  to develop contraceptive formulation products containing nestorone  by using the population council s patented compound and other proprietary information covering the compound  and our transdermal delivery gel technology 
under the terms of the joint development agreement  we are responsible for research and development activities as they relate to atd formulation and manufacturing 
the population council will be responsible for clinical trial design development and management 
together  we expect to identify a worldwide or regional commercial development partner as clinical data becomes available 
in september  we entered into a supply agreement with teva 
pursuant to the agreement  teva is obligated to purchase all of its delivery device requirements from us for hgh marketed in the united states 
we received an upfront cash payment  and will receive milestone fees and a royalty payment on teva s net sales of hgh  as well as a purchase price for each device sold 
in july  we entered into a worldwide product development and license agreement with jazz for ropinirole which is being developed to treat a cns disorder that will utilize our transdermal gel delivery technology atd 
under the agreement  an upfront payment  development milestones  and royalties on product sales are to be received by us under certain circumstances 
in december  we entered into a license  development and supply agreement with teva under which we will develop and supply a disposable pen injector for use with two undisclosed patient administered pharmaceutical products 
under the agreement  an upfront payment  development milestones  and royalties on product sales are to be received by us under certain circumstances 
in november we entered into a license agreement with ferring under which we licensed certain of our patents and agreed to transfer know how for our transdermal gel technology for certain pharmaceutical products 
under this agreement  we received an upfront payment and will receive milestone payments as certain defined milestones are achieved 
distribution supply agreements are arrangements under which our products are supplied to end users through the distributor or supplier 
we provide the distributor supplier with injection devices and related disposable components  and the distributor supplier often receives a margin on sales 
we currently have a number of distribution supply arrangements under which the distributors suppliers sell our needle free injection devices and related disposable components for use with insulin 
seasonality of business we do not believe our business  either device or pharmaceutical  is subject to seasonality 
we are subject to and affected by the business practices of our pharmaceutical device partners 
inventory practices of our partners may subject us to product sales fluctuations quarter to quarter or year over year 
additionally  development revenue we derive from our partners is subject to fluctuation based on the number of programs being conducted by our partners as well as delays or lack of funding for those programs 
proprietary rights when appropriate  we actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of us and international patents and trademarks 
we currently hold numerous patents and numerous additional patent applications pending in the us and other countries 
our patents have expiration dates ranging from to in addition to issued patents and patent applications  we are also protected by trade secrets in all of our technology platforms 
some of our technology is developed on our behalf by independent outside contractors 
to protect the rights of our proprietary know how and technology  company policy requires all employees and consultants with access to proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside the company 
these agreements also require disclosure and assignment to us of discoveries and inventions made by such individuals while devoted to company sponsored activities 
companies with which we have entered into development agreements have the right to certain technology developed in connection with such agreements 
government regulation any potential products discovered  developed and manufactured by us or our collaborative partners must comply with  comprehensive regulation by the fda in the united states and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state  and local entities regulate  among other things  the pre clinical and clinical testing  safety  effectiveness  approval  manufacturing operations  quality  labeling  distribution  marketing  export  storage  record keeping  event reporting  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 
facilities and certain company records are also subject to inspections by the fda and comparable authorities or their representatives 
the fda has broad discretion in enforcing the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fd c act and the regulations thereunder  and noncompliance can result in a variety of regulatory steps ranging from warning letters  product detentions  device alerts or field corrections to mandatory recalls  seizures  injunctive actions and civil or criminal actions or penalties 
drug approval process transdermal and topical products indicated for the treatment of systemic or local treatments respectively are regulated by the fda in the us and other similar regulatory agencies in other countries as drug products 
transdermal and topical products are considered to be controlled release dosage forms and may not be marketed in the us until they have been demonstrated to be safe and effective 
the regulatory approval routes for transdermal and topical products include the filing of an nda for new drugs  new indications of approved drugs or new dosage forms of approved drugs 
alternatively  these dosage forms can obtain marketing approval as a generic product by the filing of an anda  providing the new generic product is bioequivalent to and has the same labeling as a comparable approved product or as a filing under section b of the fd c act where there is an acceptable reference product 
many topical products for local treatment do not require the filing of either an nda or anda  providing that these products comply with existing otc monographs 
the combination of the drug  its dosage form and label claims  and fda requirements will ultimately determine which regulatory approval route will be required 
the process required by the fda before a new drug pharmaceutical product or a new route of administration of a pharmaceutical product may be approved for marketing in the united states generally involves pre clinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug ind application  which must be in effect before clinical trials may begin  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for its intended indication s  fda compliance inspection and or clearance of all manufacturers  submission to the fda of an nda  and fda review of the nda or product license application in order to determine  among other things  whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended uses 
pre clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  as well as animal studies  to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product 
certain pre clinical tests must comply with fda regulations regarding current good laboratory practices 
the results of the pre clinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  to support human clinical trials and are reviewed by the fda  with patient safety as the primary objective  prior to the ind commencement of human clinical trials 
clinical trials are conducted according to protocols that detail matters such as a description of the condition to be treated  the objectives of the study  a description of the patient population eligible for the study and the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
protocols must be conducted in accordance with fda regulations concerning good clinical practices to ensure the quality and integrity of clinical trial results and data 
failure to adhere to good clinical practices and the protocols may result in fda rejection of clinical trial results and data  and may delay or prevent the fda from approving the drug for commercial use 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  which may overlap 
during phase i  when the drug is initially given to human subjects  the product is tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  distribution  metabolism and excretion 
phase i studies are often conducted with healthy volunteers depending on the drug being tested  however  in oncology  phase i trials are more often conducted in cancer patients 
phase ii involves studies in a limited patient population  typically patients with the conditions needing treatment  to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific  targeted indications  determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
pivotal or phase iii adequate and well controlled trials are undertaken in order to evaluate efficacy and safety in a comprehensive fashion within an expanded patient population for the purpose of registering the new drug 
the fda may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any point in this process if it concludes that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if they decide it is unethical to continue the study 
results of pre clinical and clinical trials must be summarized in comprehensive reports for the fda 
in addition  the results of phase iii studies are often subject to rigorous statistical analyses 
this data may be presented in accordance with the guidelines for the international committee of harmonization that can facilitate registration in the united states  the eu and japan 
fda approval of our own and our collaborators products is required before the products may be commercialized in the united states 
fda approval of an nda will be based  among other factors  on the comprehensive reporting of clinical data  risk benefit analysis  animal studies and manufacturing processes and facilities 
the process of obtaining nda approvals from the fda can be costly and time consuming and may be affected by unanticipated delays 
a snda is a submission to an existing nda that provides for changes to the nda and therefore requires fda approval 
changes to the nda that require fda approval are the subject of either the active ingredients  the drug product and or the labeling 
a supplement is required to fully describe the change 
both before and after market approval is obtained  a product  its manufacturer and the holder of the nda for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight 
violations of regulatory requirements at any stage  including after approval  may result in various adverse consequences  including the fda s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  withdrawal of an approved product from the market and the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer and nda holder 
in addition  later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or nda holder  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
furthermore  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development 
fda approval is required before a generic drug equivalent can be marketed 
we seek approval for such products by submitting an anda to the fda 
when processing an anda  the fda waives the requirement of conducting complete clinical studies  although it normally requires bioavailability and or bioequivalence studies 
bioavailability indicates the extent of absorption of a drug product in the blood stream 
bioequivalence indicates that the active drug substance that is the subject of the anda submission is equivalent to the previously approved drug 
an anda may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of a previously approved drug or  in the case of a new dosage form  is suitable for use for the indications specified 
the timing of final fda approval of an anda depends on a variety of factors  including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the brand name manufacturer is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods  during which the fda may be prohibited from accepting applications for  or approving  generic products 
in certain circumstances  a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent  and thus block andas from being approved on the patent expiration date 
for example  in certain circumstances the fda may extend the exclusivity of a product by six months past the date of patent expiry if the manufacturer undertakes studies on the effect of their product in children  a so called pediatric extension 
before approving a product  either through the nda or anda route  the fda also requires that our procedures and operations or those of our contracted manufacturer conform to current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations  relating to good manufacturing practices as defined in the us code of federal regulations 
we and our contracted manufacturer must follow the cgmp regulations at all times during the manufacture of our products 
we will continue to spend significant time  money and effort in the areas of production and quality testing to help ensure full compliance with cgmp regulations and continued marketing of our products now or in the future 
if the fda believes a company is not in compliance with cgmp  sanctions may be imposed upon that company including withholding from the company new drug approvals as well as approvals for supplemental changes to existing applications  preventing the company from receiving the necessary export licenses to export its products  and classifying the company as an unacceptable supplier and thereby disqualifying the company from selling products to federal agencies 
our drug products such as anturol gel and nestorone gel  as well as our products being developed by our partners are subject to the above regulations 
anturol and nestorone will be subject to the nda process 
device combination products developed and currently being developed by our partner teva are subject to the snda  anda and b regulations cited above 
device approval process products regulated as medical devices can be commercially distributed in the united states following approval by the fda  through a finding of substantial equivalence to a marketed product  or by having been exempted from the fd c act and regulations thereunder 
in cases of substantial equivalence  under section k of the fd c act  certain products qualify for a pre market notification pmn of the manufacturer s intention to commence marketing the product 
the manufacturer must  among other things  establish in the pmn that the product to be marketed is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product that it has the same intended use and that it is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise questions of safety and effectiveness that are different from those associated with the legally marketed device 
marketing may commence when the fda issues a letter finding substantial equivalence to such a legally marketed device 
the fda may require  in connection with a pmn  that it be provided with animal and or human test results 
if a medical device does not qualify for pmn  the manufacturer must file a pre market approval pma application under section of the fd c act 
a pma must show that the device is safe and effective 
a pma is generally a much more complex submission than a k notification  typically requiring more extensive pre filing testing and a longer fda review process 
drug delivery systems such as injectors may be legally marketed as a medical device or may be evaluated as part of the drug approval process such as a nda or a product license application pla 
combination drug device products raise unique scientific  technical and regulatory issues 
the fda has established an office of combination products ocp to address the challenges associated with the review and regulation of combination products 
the ocp assists in determining strategies for the approval of drug delivery combinations and assuring agreement within the fda on review responsibilities 
to the extent permitted under the fd c act and current fda policy  we intend to seek regulatory review for drug delivery systems for use in specific drug applications under the medical device provisions  rather than under the new drug provisions  of the fd c act 
device regulatory filings could take the form of a pmn  pma  or the filing of a device master file maf 
in some cases  the device specific information may need to be filed as part of the drug approval submission  and in those cases we will seek agreement from the agency for review of the device portion of the submission by the center for devices and radiological health cdrh under the medical device provisions of the law 
a maf filing typically supports a regulatory filing in the approval pathway 
where common data elements may be part of several submissions for regulatory approval  as in the case of information supporting an injection platform  a maf filing with the fda may be the preferred route 
a delivery device that is considered a product only when combined with a drug  and where such a device is applicable to a variety of drugs  represents another opportunity for such a filing 
we intend to pursue such strategies as permitted by the law and as directed by the fda either through guidance documents or discussions 
in addition to submission when a device is being introduced into the market for the first time  a pmn is also required when the manufacturer makes a change or modification to a previously marketed device that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness  or where there is a major change or modification in the intended use or in the manufacture of the device 
when any change or modification is made in a device or its intended use  the manufacturer is expected to make the initial determination as to whether the change or modification is of a kind that would necessitate the filing of a new k notification 
the vision injection system is a legally marketed device under section k of the fd c act for insulin 
in the future we or our partners may submit additional k notifications with regard to further device design improvements and uses with additional drug therapies 
if the fda concludes that any or all of our new injectors must be handled under the new drug provisions of the fd c act  substantially greater regulatory requirements and approval times will be imposed 
use of a modified new product with a previously unapproved new drug likely will be handled as part of the nda for the new drug itself 
under these circumstances  the device component will be handled as a drug accessory and will be approved  if ever  only when the nda itself is approved 
our injectors may be required to be approved as a combination drug device product under a snda for use with previously approved drugs 
under these circumstances  our device could be used with the drug only if and when the supplemental nda is approved for this purpose 
it is possible that  for some or even all drugs  the fda may take the position that a drug specific approval must be obtained through a full nda or supplemental nda before the device may be packaged and sold in combination with a particular drug 
teva  a pharmaceutical partner of ours  filed a snda with the fda for hgh for use with our tjet device in july the snda was approved in june of teva launched the tjet device in august of for use in delivery of teva s form of hgh  tev tropin 
to the extent that our modified injectors are packaged with the drug  as part of a drug delivery system  the entire package may be subject to the requirements for drug device combination products 
these include drug manufacturing requirements  drug adverse reaction reporting requirements  and all of the restrictions that apply to drug labeling and advertising 
in general  the drug requirements under the fd c act are more onerous than medical device requirements 
these requirements could have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to commercialize our products and our operations 
the fd c act also regulates quality control and manufacturing procedures by requiring that we and our contract manufacturers demonstrate compliance with the current qsr 
the fda s interpretation and enforcement of these requirements have been increasingly strict in recent years and seem likely to be even more stringent in the future 
the fda monitors compliance with these requirements by requiring manufacturers to register with the fda and by conducting periodic fda inspections of manufacturing facilities 
if the inspector observes conditions that might violate the qsr  the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily 
failure to adhere to qsr requirements would cause the devices produced to be considered in violation of the fda act and subject to fda enforcement action that might include physical removal of the devices from the marketplace 
the fda s medical device reporting regulation requires companies to provide information to the fda on the occurrence of any death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of their products  as well as any product malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
in addition  fda regulations prohibit a device from being marketed for unapproved or uncleared indications 
if the fda believes that a company is not in compliance with these regulations  it could institute proceedings to detain or seize company products  issue a recall  seek injunctive relief or assess civil and criminal penalties against the company or its executive officers  directors or employees 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we must also comply with regulations under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act and other federal  state and local regulations 
foreign approval process in addition to regulations in the united states  we are subject to various foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products 
we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement and the regulatory approval process all vary greatly from country to country 
additionally  the time it takes to complete the approval process in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
foreign regulatory approvals of our products are necessary whether or not we obtain fda approval for such products 
finally  before a new drug may be exported from the united states  it must either be approved for marketing in the united states or meet the requirements of exportation of an unapproved drug under section of the export reform and enhancement act or comply with fda regulations pertaining to inds 
under european union regulatory systems  we are permitted to submit marketing authorizations under either a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all member states of the european union 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions by permitting the holder of a national marketing authorization to submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
sales of medical devices outside of the us are subject to foreign legal and regulatory requirements 
certain of our transdermal and injection systems have been approved for sale only in certain foreign jurisdictions 
legal restrictions on the sale of imported medical devices and products vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and the requirements may differ 
we rely upon the companies marketing our injectors in foreign countries to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for sales of our products in those countries 
generally  products having an effective section k clearance or pma may be exported without further fda authorization 
we have obtained iso certification  the medical device industry standard for our quality systems 
this certification shows that our development and manufacturing comply with standards for quality assurance  design capability and manufacturing process control 
such certification  along with compliance with the european medical device directive enables us to affix the ce mark a certification indicating that a product has met eu consumer safety  health or environmental requirements to current products and supply the device with a declaration of conformity 
semi annual audits by our notified body  british standards institute  are required to demonstrate continued compliance 
employees we believe that our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the research  development  manufacturing  business development and commercialization fields 
as of march   we had full time employees  of whom are in the united states 
of the employees  are primarily involved in research  development and manufacturing activities  two are primarily involved in business development and commercialization  with the remainder engaged in executive and administrative capacities 
although we believe that we are appropriately sized to focus on our mission  we intend to add personnel with specialized expertise  as needed 
we believe that we have been successful to date in attracting skilled and experienced scientific and business professionals 
we consider our employee relations to be good  and none of our employees are represented by any labor union or other collective bargaining unit

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors contain important information about us and our business and should be read in their entirety 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be not material could also impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all of your investment 
in this section  the terms the company  we  our and us refer to antares pharma  inc risks related to our operations we have incurred significant losses to date  and there is no guarantee that we will ever become profitable 
we incurred net losses of  and  in the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
in addition  we have accumulated aggregate net losses from the inception of business through december  of  in addition  we expect to report a net loss for the year ending december  the costs for research and product development of our drug delivery technologies along with marketing and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses have been the principal causes of our losses 
we may not ever become profitable and if we do not become profitable your investment would be harmed 
we may need additional capital in the future in order to continue our operations 
in july of  we completed a registered direct offering of our common stock and warrants in which we received aggregate gross proceeds of  in september of  we received gross proceeds of  from an additional registered direct offering of common stock and warrants 
in september  we used approximately  of the stock sales proceeds to pay down an existing credit facility 
in addition  we received proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises of  and  in and  respectively 
if additional capital is needed in the near term to support operations  the current economic and market conditions may make it difficult to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings 
at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of  although the combination of our current cash and cash equivalents balance and projected product sales  product development  license revenues  milestone payments and royalties may provide us with sufficient funds to support operations for the next months  we may need to pursue a financing or reduce expenditures as necessary to meet our cash requirements over the next months 
if we do obtain such financing  we cannot assure that the amount or the terms of such financing will be as attractive as we may desire 
if we are unable to obtain such financing when needed  or if the amount of such financing is not sufficient  it may be necessary for us to take significant cost saving measures or generate funding in ways that may negatively affect our business in the future 
to reduce expenses  we may be forced to make personnel reductions  eliminate departments or curtail or discontinue development programs 
to generate funds  it may be necessary to monetize future royalty streams  sell intellectual property  divest of technology platforms or liquidate assets 
however  there is no assurance that  if required  we will be able to generate sufficient funds or reduce spending to provide the required liquidity 
long term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the status of collaborative arrangements  the progress of research and development programs and the receipt of revenues from sales of products 
our ability to achieve and or sustain profitable operations depends on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following timing of our partners development  regulatory and commercialization plans  the demand for our technologies from current and future biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners  our ability to manufacture products efficiently  at the appropriate commercial scale  and with the required quality  our ability to increase and continue to outsource manufacturing capacity to allow for new product introductions  the level of product competition and of price competition  patient acceptance of our current and future products  our ability to develop additional commercial applications for our products  our limited regulatory and commercialization experience  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  our ability to attract the right personnel to execute our plans  our ability to develop  maintain or acquire patent positions  our ability to control costs  and general economic conditions 
the failure of any of our third party licensees to develop  obtain regulatory approvals for  market  distribute and sell our products as planned may result in us not meeting revenue and profit targets 
pharmaceutical company partners such as teva help us develop  obtain regulatory approvals for  manufacture and sell our products 
if one or more of these pharmaceutical company partners fail to pursue the development or marketing of the products as planned  our revenues and profits may not reach expectations or may decline 
we may not be able to control the timing and other aspects of the development of products because pharmaceutical company partners may have priorities that differ from ours 
therefore  commercialization of products under development may be delayed unexpectedly 
generally speaking  in the near term  we do not intend to have a direct marketing channel to consumers for our drug delivery products or technologies except through current distributor agreements in the united states for our insulin delivery device 
therefore  the success of the marketing organizations of our pharmaceutical company partners  as well as the level of priority assigned to the marketing of the products by these entities  which may differ from our priorities  will determine the success of the products incorporating our technologies 
competition in this market could also force us to reduce the prices of our technologies below currently planned levels  which could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability 
additionally  there is no assurance that regulatory filings by our partners in the us will be deemed sufficient by the fda  potentially delaying product launches 
we currently depend on a limited number of customers for the majority of our revenue  and the loss of any one of these customers could substantially reduce our revenue and impact our liquidity 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from ferring and from teva 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from ferring and of our revenue from biosante 
the revenue from ferring was primarily product sales and royalties 
the revenue from teva was license and development revenue and product sales 
the revenue from biosante was primarily milestone based and will likely not be recurring in the near future 
the loss of any of these customers or partners or reduction in our business activities could cause our revenues to decrease significantly  increase our continuing losses from operations and  ultimately  could require us to cease operations 
if we cannot broaden our customer base  we will continue to depend on a few customers for the majority of our revenues 
additionally  if we are unable to negotiate favorable business terms with these customers in the future  our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and or sustain profitability or continue operations 
we have entered into four license  development and or supply agreements for five potential products since november of with teva or an affiliate of teva 
to date we have received fda approval of one of those products  the tjet needle free device for use with hgh 
teva is currently marketing the tjet device to its patients and we expect product sales and royalties from this product into the future 
although certain upfront and milestone payments have been received for the other programs with teva  timelines have been extended and there can be no assurance that there ever will be commercial sales or future milestone payments under these other agreements 
in july  we entered into a worldwide product development and license agreement with jazz 
under the agreement an upfront payment  development milestones  and royalties on product sales are to be paid to us under certain circumstances 
the development program conducted by jazz is currently on hold and we may never receive any compensation other than the upfront payment earned at agreement execution and other development revenue 
in june  we entered into an exclusive agreement to license four applications of our drug delivery technology to biosante 
biosante is using the licensed technology for the development of hormone replacement therapy products that include libigel transdermal testosterone gel in phase clinical development for the treatment of fsd  and elestrin estradiol gel for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause  and currently marketed in the us under the agreement an upfront payment  development milestones and royalties on product sales are to be paid to us 
we also receive a portion of any sublicense fees received by biosante 
part of our business model is to be commercially oriented by further developing our own products  and we may not have sufficient resources to fully execute our plan 
we must make choices as to the drugs that we develop on our own 
we may not make the correct choice of drug or technologies when combined with a drug  which may not be accepted by the marketplace as we expected or at all 
fda approval processes for the drugs and drugs with devices may be longer in time and or more costly and or require more extended clinical evaluation than anticipated 
funds required to bring our own products to market may be more than anticipated or may not be available at all 
we have limited experience in development of compounds  regulatory matters and bringing such products to market  therefore  we may experience difficulties in execution of development of internal product candidates 
if we or our third party manufacturer are unable to supply ferring with our devices pursuant to our current device license agreement with ferring  ferring could own a fully paid up license for certain of our intellectual property 
pursuant to our license agreement with ferring  we licensed certain of our intellectual property related to our needle free injection devices  including a license that allows ferring to manufacture our devices on its own under certain circumstances for use with its hgh product 
in accordance with the license agreement  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with a third party to manufacture our devices for ferring 
if we or this third party are unable to meet our obligations to supply ferring with our devices  ferring would own a fully paid up license to manufacture our devices and to use and exploit our intellectual property in connection with ferring s human growth hormone product 
in such an event  we would no longer receive product sales and manufacturing margins from ferring  however we would still receive royalties 
if we do not develop and maintain relationships with manufacturers of our drug candidates  then we may be unable to successfully manufacture and sell our pharmaceutical products 
we do not possess the capabilities or facilities to manufacture commercial quantities of anturol  which is currently in development for overactive bladder  or any other of our future drug candidates 
we must contract with manufacturers to produce anturol according to government regulations 
our future development and delivery of our product candidates depends on the timely  profitable and competitive performance of these manufacturers 
a limited number of manufacturers exist which are capable of manufacturing our product candidates 
we may fail to contract with the necessary manufacturers or we may contract with manufactures on terms that may not be favorable to us 
our manufacturers must obtain fda approval for their manufacturing processes  and we have no control over this approval process 
additionally  use of contract manufacturers exposes us to risks in the manufacturer s business such as their potential inability to perform from a technical  operational or financial standpoint 
we have contracted with a commercial supplier of pharmaceutical chemicals to supply us with the active pharmaceutical ingredient of oxybutynin for clinical quantities of anturol in a manner that meets fda requirements via reference of their dmf for oxybutynin 
additionally  we have contracted with patheon  a manufacturing development company  to supply clinical quantities of anturol in a manner that meets fda requirements 
the fda has not approved the manufacturing processes of patheon for anturol 
any failure by patheon or our supplier of the active ingredient oxybutynin to achieve or maintain compliance with fda standards could significantly harm our business since we do not currently have approved secondary manufacturers for anturol gel or oxybutynin 
if we do not develop and maintain relationships with manufacturers of our device products  then we may be unable to successfully manufacture and sell our device products 
our device manufacturing for our needle free device has involved the assembly of products from machined stainless steel and composite components in limited quantities 
our planned future device business may necessitate changes and additions to our contract manufacturing and assembly process due to the anticipated larger scale of manufacturing in our business plan 
our devices must be manufactured in compliance with regulatory requirements  in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities while maintaining quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
in the course of these changes and additions to our manufacturing and production methods  we may encounter difficulties  including problems involving scale up  yields  quality control and assurance  product reliability  manufacturing costs  existing and new equipment and component supplies  any of which could result in significant delays in production 
we operate under a manufacturing agreement with minnesota rubber and plastics mrp  a contract manufacturing company  who manufactures and assembles our needle free devices and certain related disposable component parts for our partners teva  ferring and jcr 
there can be no assurance that mrp will be able to continue to meet these regulatory requirements or our own quality control standards 
therefore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully produce and manufacture our products 
our pharmaceutical partners retain the right to audit the quality systems of our manufacturing partner  and there can be no assurance that mrp will be successful in these audits 
any of these failures would negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will also continue to outsource manufacturing of our future disposable injection products to third parties 
such products will be price sensitive and may be required to be manufactured in large quantities  and we have no assurance that this can be done 
additionally  use of contract manufacturers exposes us to risks in the manufacturers business such as their potential inability to perform from a technical  operational or financial standpoint 
we have contracted with nypro  an international manufacturing development company to commercialize our vibex pressure assisted auto injector device in compliance with fda qsr regulations 
any failure by nypro to successfully manufacture the pressure assisted auto injector device in commercial quantities  be in compliance with regulatory regulations  or pass the audits by our pharmaceutical partner would have a negative impact on our future revenue expectations 
we rely on third parties to supply components for our products  and any failure to retain relationships with these third parties could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 
certain of our technologies contain a number of customized components manufactured by various third parties 
regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing can make substitution of suppliers costly and time consuming 
in the event that we could not obtain adequate quantities of these customized components from our suppliers  there can be no assurance that we would be able to access alternative sources of such components within a reasonable period of time  on acceptable terms or at all 
the unavailability of adequate quantities  the inability to develop alternative sources  a reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of components could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products 
our products have achieved only limited acceptance by patients and physicians  which continues to restrict marketing penetration and the resulting sales of more of our products 
our business ultimately depends on patient and physician acceptance of our reusable needle free injectors  disposable pressure assisted auto injectors  transdermal gels and our other drug delivery technologies as an alternative to more traditional forms of drug delivery  including injections using a needle  orally ingested drugs and more traditional transdermal patch products 
to date  our drug delivery technologies have achieved only limited acceptance from such parties 
the degree of acceptance of our drug delivery systems depends on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following advantages over alternative drug delivery systems or similar products from other companies  demonstrated clinical efficacy  safety and enhanced patient compliance  cost effectiveness  convenience and ease of use of injectors and transdermal gels  marketing and distribution support  and successful launch of our pharmaceutical partners products which utilize our devices 
physicians may refuse to prescribe products incorporating our drug delivery technologies if they believe that the active ingredient is better administered to a patient using alternative drug delivery technologies  that the time required to explain use of the technologies to the patient would not be offset by advantages  or they believe that the delivery method will result in patient noncompliance 
factors such as patient perceptions that a gel is inconvenient to apply or that devices do not deliver the drug at the same rate as conventional drug delivery methods may cause patients to reject our drug delivery technologies 
because only a limited number of products incorporating our drug delivery technologies are commercially available  we cannot yet fully assess the level of market acceptance of our drug delivery technologies 
if transdermal gels do not achieve greater market acceptance  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
because transdermal gels are not a widely understood method of drug delivery  our potential partners and consumers may have little experience with such products 
our assumption of higher value may not be shared by the potential partner and consumer 
to date  transdermal gels have gained successful entry into only a limited number of markets such as the testosterone replacement market 
there can be no assurance that transdermal gels will ever gain market acceptance beyond these markets sufficient to allow us to achieve and or sustain profitable operations in this product area 
elestrin  our transdermal estradiol gel  was launched by biosante s marketing partner bradley in june bradley was acquired by nycomed in february biosante reacquired elestrin from nycomed and in december relicensed all manufacturing  distribution and marketing responsibilities of elestrin to azur 
the multiple licenses of elestrin has had a negative impact on the marketing efforts of elestrin and to date  the market penetration of elestrin has been low 
we are developing anturol  our oxybutynin gel for overactive bladder 
we may seek a pharmaceutical partner to assist in the development and marketing of this potential product 
however  we may be unsuccessful in partnering anturol which may delay or affect the timing of the potential product launch due to availability of resources if anturol is ultimately approved by the fda 
as health insurance companies and other third party payors increasingly challenge the products and services for which they will provide coverage  our individual consumers may not be able to receive adequate reimbursement or may be unable to afford to use our products  which could substantially reduce our revenues and negatively impact our business as a whole 
our injector device products are currently sold in the european community and elsewhere for use with human growth hormone and in the united states for use with human growth hormone and insulin 
in the case of human growth hormone  our products are generally provided to users at no cost by the drug supplier 
although it is impossible for us to identify the amount of sales of our products that our customers will submit for payment to third party insurers  at least some of these sales may be dependent in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from these third party healthcare payors 
currently  insurance companies and other third party payors reimburse the cost of certain technologies on a case by case basis and may refuse reimbursement if they do not perceive benefits to a technology s use in a particular case 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and devices  and there can be no assurance that such third party payors will not in the future increasingly reject claims for coverage of the cost of certain of our technologies 
insurance and third party payor practice vary from country to country  and changes in practices could negatively affect our business if the cost burden for our technologies were shifted more to the patient 
therefore  there can be no assurance that adequate levels of reimbursement will be available to enable us to achieve or maintain market acceptance of our products or technologies or maintain price levels sufficient to realize profitable operations 
there is also a possibility of increased government control or influence over a broad range of healthcare expenditures in the future 
any such trend could negatively impact the market for our drug delivery products and technologies 
elestrin  for which we receive royalties from our partner based on any commercial sales  was launched in june we have no way of knowing at this time if health insurance companies reimbursement has negatively impacted patient use of elestrin 
our tjet device was launched in the us in for use with hgh by teva 
although teva currently provides the device and disposables at no cost to the patient  the amount of health insurance reimbursement of teva s hgh  tev tropin  has a direct impact on the device product sales and royalty due from teva to us 
the loss of any existing licensing agreements or the failure to enter into new licensing agreements could substantially affect our revenue 
one of our primary business pathways requires us to enter into license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies covering the development  manufacture  use and marketing of drug delivery technologies with specific drug therapies 
under these arrangements  the partner companies typically assist us in the development of systems for such drug therapies and collect or sponsor the collection of the appropriate data for submission for regulatory approval of the use of the drug delivery technology with the licensed drug therapy 
our licensees may also be responsible for distribution and marketing of the technologies for these drug therapies either worldwide or in specific territories 
we are currently a party to a number of such agreements  all of which are currently in varying stages of development 
we may not be able to meet future milestones established in our agreements such milestones generally being structured around satisfactory completion of certain phases of clinical development  regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product and thus  would not receive the fees expected from such arrangements  related future royalties or product sales 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing additional collaborative agreements or that existing or future agreements will result in increased sales of our drug delivery technologies 
in such event  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  and our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and or sustain profitability 
as a result of our collaborative agreements  we are dependent upon the development  data collection and marketing efforts of our licensees 
the amount and timing of resources such licensees devote to these efforts are not within our control  and such licensees could make material decisions regarding these efforts that could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  factors that adversely impact the introduction and level of sales of any drug or drug device covered by such licensing arrangements  including competition within the pharmaceutical and medical device industries  the timing of regulatory or other approvals and intellectual property litigation  may also negatively affect sales of our drug delivery technology 
we are relying on partners such as teva  ferring  biosante and jazz for future milestone  sales and royalty revenue 
any or all of these partners may never commercialize a product with our technologies or significant delays in anticipated launches of these products may occur 
any potential loss of anticipated future revenue could have an adverse affect on our business and the value of your investment 
if we cannot develop and market our products as rapidly or cost effectively as our competitors  then we may never be able to achieve profitable operations 
competitors in the overactive bladder  injector device and other markets  some with greater resources and experience than us  may enter these markets  as there is an increasing recognition of a need for less invasive methods of delivering drugs 
our success depends  in part  upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in rapidly evolving fields 
if we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies  our current and potential pharmaceutical company partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors 
companies that compete with our technologies include watson pharmaceuticals  ipsomed  owen mumford  elcam  shl  bioject medical technologies  inc  auxillium  aradigm  zogenix  inc  columbia laboratories  inc  nexmed  inc 
and west pharmaceuticals  along with other companies 
we also compete generally with other drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing  managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do  and  therefore  represent significant competition 
additionally  new drug delivery technologies are mostly used only with drugs for which other drug delivery methods are not possible  in particular with biopharmaceutical proteins drugs derived from living organisms  such as insulin and human growth hormone that cannot currently be delivered orally or transdermally 
transdermal patches and gels are also used for drugs that cannot be delivered orally or where oral delivery has other limitations such as high first pass drug metabolism  meaning that the drug dissipates quickly in the digestive system and  therefore  requires frequent administration 
many companies  both large and small  are engaged in research and development efforts on less invasive methods of delivering drugs that cannot be taken orally 
the successful development and commercial introduction of such non injection techniques could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and general prospects 
competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approval for products before we do 
competitors products may gain market acceptance more rapidly than our products  or may be priced more favorably than our products 
developments by competitors may render our products  or potential products  noncompetitive or obsolete 
one of our competitors  watson pharmaceuticals  completed a phase iii study of its own oxybutynin gel gelnique for oab in january and in january gelnique was approved by the fda 
watson s launch of their oxybutynin gel is well ahead of anturol s potential launch which may limit the success of anturol in the market  if approved 
additionally  watson has greater resources than we do  which may impact our ability to be competitive in the oab market 
although we have applied for  and have received  several patents  we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  which would negatively affect our ability to compete 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents for our products  processes and technologies and to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
if we cannot do so  our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues and profits from our developments 
we currently hold numerous patents and numerous patent applications pending in the us and other countries 
our current patents may not be valid or enforceable and may not protect us against competitors that challenge our patents  obtain their own patents that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or are able to otherwise circumvent our patents 
additionally  our technologies are complex and one patent may not be sufficient to protect our products where a series of patents may be needed 
further  we may not have the necessary financial resources to enforce or defend our patents or patent applications 
in addition  any patent applications we may have made or may make relating to inventions for our actual or potential products  processes and technologies may not result in patents being issued or may result in patents that provide insufficient or incomplete coverage for our inventions 
to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technologies and processes  we rely  in part  on confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and advisors 
these agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure  or if others lawfully and independently develop the same or similar information 
others may bring infringement claims against us  which could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
third parties may claim that the manufacture  use or sale of our drug delivery technologies infringe their patent rights 
if such claims are asserted  we may have to seek licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in the patent office or the courts 
if we cannot avoid infringement or obtain required licenses on acceptable terms  we may not be able to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
even if we were able to obtain rights to a third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors potential access to the same intellectual property 
if we are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid  we may be liable for significant monetary damages  encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by patents of others 
even if we were able to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
we may not have identified  or be able to identify in the future  united states or foreign patents that pose a risk of potential infringement claims 
furthermore  in the event a patent infringement suit is brought against us  the development  manufacture or potential sale of product candidates claimed to infringe on a third party s intellectual property may have to stop or be delayed 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our product candidates as a result of patent infringement claims  which could harm our business 
we are aware of two related us patents issued to watson pharmaceuticals relating to a gel formulation of oxybutynin gelnique 
we believe that we do not infringe these patents and that they should not have been granted 
we may seek to invalidate these patents but there can be no assurance that we will prevail 
if the patents are determined to be valid and if anturol is approved  we may be delayed in our marketing of anturol or incur significant expenses defending our patent position which may adversely affect the potential market value of anturol 
we are aware that one of our partners has been sued for infringement by another party related to a potential product incorporating one of our devices 
we believe the claim has no merit but we have no assurance that our partner will prevail in the suit  which could result in significant litigation cost  product launch delay or ultimately the abandonment of the potential product incorporating our device 
our business may suffer if we lose certain key officers or employees or if we are not able to add additional key officers or employees necessary to reach our goals 
the success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain of our key officers and employees 
the loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining key personnel 
we consider our employee relations to be good  however  competition for personnel is intense and we cannot assume that we will continue to be able to attract and retain personnel of high caliber 
we are involved in international markets  and this subjects us to additional business risks 
we license and distribute our products in the european community  asia and the united states 
these geographic localities provide economically and politically stable environments in which to operate 
however  in the future  we intend to introduce products through partnerships in other countries 
as we expand our geographic market  we will face additional ongoing complexity to our business and may encounter the following additional risks increased complexity and costs of managing international operations  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies  dependence on local vendors  multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  difficulties in enforcing our legal rights  reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights  and political and economic instability 
a significant portion of our international revenues is denominated in foreign currencies 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to these currencies may make our products more expensive and  thus  less competitive in foreign markets 
if we make any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and might never successfully integrate the acquired product or business into ours 
we might attempt to acquire products or businesses that we believe are a strategic complement to our business model 
we might encounter operating difficulties and expenditures relating to integrating an acquired product or business 
these acquisitions might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
in addition  we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
we might also make dilutive issuances of equity securities  incur debt or experience a decrease in cash available for our operations  or incur contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses relating to goodwill and other intangible assets  in connection with future acquisitions 
if we do not have adequate insurance for product liability or clinical trial claims  then we may be subject to significant expenses relating to these claims 
our business entails the risk of product liability and clinical trial claims 
although we have not experienced any material claims to date  any such claims could have a material adverse impact on our business 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
we maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance with coverage of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million and evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis 
if the coverage limits of the product liability insurance are not adequate  a claim brought against us  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
risks related to general economic conditions uncertainty in the global credit markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing  and we cannot assure that financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
the global credit markets have experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets 
continued uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing  which could negatively affect our ability to fund our current operations as well as our future development and our business could be adversely affected 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  if we raise additional financing via issuance of securities  such future issuance of our securities may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
we are susceptible to the current conditions of the global economy 
if the conditions do not improve  our business could be adversely affected 
the current uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a substantial slowdown in the global economy that could affect our business and financial performance by reducing the prices that our customers and third party payors may be willing or able to pay for our products 
these conditions may also reduce demand for our products  which could in turn negatively impact our sales and revenue generation and result in a material adverse effect on our business  cash flow  results of operations  financial position and prospects 
in addition  we may experience difficulties in scaling our operations to react to various economic pressures 
risks related to regulatory matters we or our licensees may incur significant costs seeking approval for our products  which could delay the realization of revenue and  ultimately  decrease our revenues from such products 
the design  development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds and medical devices are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  including the fda and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries 
the approval process is generally lengthy  expensive and subject to unanticipated delays 
currently we  along with our partners  are actively pursuing marketing approval for a number of products from regulatory authorities in other countries and anticipate seeking regulatory approval from the fda for products developed internally and pursuant to our license agreements 
in the future we  or our partners  may need to seek approval for newly developed products 
our revenue and profit will depend  in part  on the successful introduction and marketing of some or all of such products by our partners or us 
applicants for fda approval often must submit extensive clinical data and supporting information to the fda 
varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre clinical and clinical testing could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval of a drug product 
changes in fda approval policy during the development period  or changes in regulatory review for each submitted new drug application also may cause delays or rejection of an approval 
even if the fda approves a product  the approval may limit the uses or indications for which a product may be marketed  or may require further studies 
the fda also can withdraw product clearances and approvals for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if unforeseen problems follow initial marketing 
we are currently developing anturol for the treatment of overactive bladder oab 
anturol is the anticholinergic oxybutynin delivered by our proprietary atd gel that is used to achieve therapeutic blood levels of the active compound that can be sustained over hours after a single  daily application 
in february  we announced the results of our phase ii dose ranging study for our atd oxybutynin gel product anturol 
the study was an open label  single period  randomized study using healthy subjects and three different doses of anturol over a day period 
our overall conclusions of the study were positive 
the fda however  may not concur with our analysis of the data 
in july  we completed a special protocol assessment spa with the fda for a pivotal trial of anturol 
a spa documents the fda s agreement that the design and planned analysis of the trial adequately addresses objectives  in support of a regulatory submission such as a nda 
the completion of the spa does not ensure success of the trial or that the fda will ultimately accept the results of the trial and we may never receive fda approval for anturol and without fda approval  we cannot market or sell anturol in the us in october  we announced the first patient dosing in a pivotal safety and efficacy trial of anturol for oab 
the three arm study will enroll approximately patients for a week clinical trial 
the randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center trial will principally evaluate the efficacy of anturol when administered topically once daily for weeks 
the primary end point of the trial will be efficacy against the placebo defined as the reduction in the number of urinary incontinence episodes experienced 
secondary end points include changes from baseline in urinary urgency  average daily urinary frequency  patient perceptions as well as safety and tolerability 
in march of we announced that enrollment in the phase iii study was complete 
the completion of enrollment of the trial does not ensure success of the trial 
anturol may prove to not be efficacious and may not beat placebo or may have undesired side effects not previously experienced 
additionally  the fda may require further studies for approval 
any of these potential outcomes could have a negative impact on the value of our stock price 
we are also developing  with our partners  injection devices for use with our partner s drugs 
the regulatory path for approval of such combination products maybe subject to review by several centers within the fda and although precedent and guidance exists for the requirements for such combination products  there is no assurance that the fda will not change what it requires or how it reviews such submissions 
human clinical testing may be required by the fda in order to commercialize these devices and there can be no assurance that such trials will be successful 
such changes in review processes or the requirement for clinical studies could delay anticipated launch dates or be at a cost which makes launching the device cost prohibitive for our partners 
such delay or failure to launch these devices could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability 
in december  one of our device partners  teva  filed an anda for their undisclosed product 
the anda submission was accepted by the fda 
teva is in the process of completing the work required for the submission 
the submission of the anda does not ensure that the fda will approve the filing and without fda approval we cannot market or sell our injector for use with this drug product in the us as part of our device regulatory strategy  we have filed two mafs with the fda 
these mafs are reviewed as part of a product application review 
amendments are made to the mafs as appropriate either because of design changes  additional test data or in response to questions from the fda 
the submission of a maf does not guarantee that the maf contains all the information required for product approval 
in other jurisdictions  we  and the pharmaceutical companies with whom we are developing technologies both drugs and devices  must obtain required regulatory approvals from regulatory agencies and comply with extensive regulations regarding safety and quality 
if approvals to market the products are delayed  if we fail to receive these approvals  or if we lose previously received approvals  our revenues may not materialize or may decline 
we may not be able to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals 
additionally  clinical data that we generate or obtain from partners from fda regulatory filings may not be sufficient for regulatory filings in other jurisdictions and we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining those regulatory approvals 
the b and j anda regulatory pathway for many of our potential products is uncertain and could result in unexpected costs and delays of approvals 
transdermal and topical products indicated for the treatment of systemic or local treatments respectively are regulated by the fda in the us and other similar regulatory agencies in other countries as drug products 
transdermal and topical products are considered to be controlled release dosage forms and may not be marketed in the us until they have been demonstrated to be safe and effective 
the regulatory approval routes for transdermal and topical products include the filing of an nda for new drugs  new indications of approved drugs or new dosage forms of approved drugs 
alternatively  these dosage forms can obtain marketing approval as a generic product by the filing of an anda  providing the new generic product is bioequivalent to and has the same labeling as a comparable approved product or as a filing under section b where there is an acceptable reference product 
other topical products for local treatment do not require the filing of either an nda or anda  providing that these products comply with existing otc monographs 
the combination of the drug  its dosage form and label claims and fda requirement will ultimately determine which regulatory approval route will be required 
many of our transdermal product candidates may be developed via the b route 
the b regulatory pathway is continually evolving and advice provided in the present is based on current standards  which may or may not be applicable when we potentially submit an nda 
additionally  we must reference the most similar predicate products when submitting a b application 
it is therefore probable that should a more appropriate reference product s be approved by the fda at any time before or during the review of our nda  we would be required to submit a new application referencing the more appropriate product  the fda cannot disclose whether such predicate product s is under development or has been submitted at any time during another company s review cycle 
drug delivery systems such as injectors are reviewed by the fda and may be legally marketed as a medical device or may be evaluated as part of the drug approval process 
combination drug device products raise unique scientific  technical and regulatory issues 
the fda has established the ocp to address the challenges associated with the review and regulation of combination products 
the ocp assists in determining strategies for the approval of drug delivery combinations and assuring agreement within the fda on review responsibilities 
we may seek approval for a product including an injector and a generic pharmaceutical by filing an anda claiming bioequivalence and the same labeling as a comparable referenced product or as a filing under section b if there is an acceptable reference product 
in reviewing the anda filing  the agency may decide that the unique nature of combination products allows them to dispute the claims of bioequivalence and or same labeling resulting in our re filing the application under section b 
if such combination products require filing under section b we may incur delays in product approval and may incur additional costs associated with testing including clinical trials 
the result of an approval for a combination product under section b may result in additional selling expenses and a decrease in market acceptance due to the lack of substitutability by pharmacies or formularies 
if the use of our injection devices require additions to or modifications of the drug labeling regulated by the fda  the review of this labeling may be undertaken by the fda s office of surveillance and epidemiology ose 
with the heightened concern surrounding medical errors  the division of medication errors and technical support dmets has the responsibility of reviewing all pre marketing labeling 
since such labeling can include device instructions for use  dmets may be involved in evaluating device usage parameters 
these reviews could increase the time needed for review completion of a successful application and may require additional studies  such as usage studies  to establish the validity of the instructions 
such reviews and requirement may extend the time necessary for the approval of drug device combinations 
such was the case for the approval of our needle free device for use with hgh 
the approval process took much more time than contemplated  which resulted in lost revenues 
accordingly  these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them might impair our ability to obtain product approval or effectively market our products 
our business could be harmed if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements and  as a result  are subject to sanctions 
if we  or pharmaceutical companies with whom we are developing technologies  fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the pharmaceutical companies  and we  may be subject to sanctions  including the following warning letters  fines  product seizures or recalls  injunctions  refusals to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the applicable regulatory jurisdiction  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  or criminal prosecutions 
our revenues may be limited if the marketing claims asserted about our products are not approved 
once a drug product is approved by the fda  the division of drug marketing  advertising and communication  the fda s marketing surveillance department within the center for drugs  must approve marketing claims asserted by our pharmaceutical company partners 
if we or a pharmaceutical company partner fails to obtain from the division of drug marketing acceptable marketing claims for a product incorporating our drug technologies  our revenues from that product may be limited 
marketing claims are the basis for a product s labeling  advertising and promotion 
the claims the pharmaceutical company partners are asserting about our drug delivery technologies  or the drug product itself  may not be approved by the division of drug marketing 
product liability claims related to participation in clinical trials or the use or misuse of our products could prove to be costly to defend and could harm our business reputation 
the testing  manufacturing and marketing of products utilizing our drug delivery technologies may expose us to potential product liability and other claims resulting from their use in practice or in clinical development 
if any such claims against us are successful  we may be required to make significant compensation payments 
any indemnification that we have obtained  or may obtain  from contract research organizations or pharmaceutical companies conducting human clinical trials on our behalf may not protect us from product liability claims or from the costs of related litigation 
similarly  any indemnification we have obtained  or may obtain  from pharmaceutical companies with whom we are developing drug delivery technologies may not protect us from product liability claims from the consumers of those products or from the costs of related litigation 
if we are subject to a product liability claim  our product liability insurance may not reimburse us  or may not be sufficient to reimburse us  for any expenses or losses that may have been suffered 
a successful product liability claim against us  if not covered by  or if in excess of our product liability insurance  may require us to make significant compensation payments  which would be reflected as expenses on our statement of operations 
adverse claim experience for our products or licensed technologies or medical device  pharmaceutical or insurance industry trends may make it difficult for us to obtain product liability insurance or we may be forced to pay very high premiums  and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all

the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes and other information contained in this report 
overview antares pharma  inc is an emerging pharma company that focuses on self injection pharmaceutical products and technologies and topical gel based products 
our subcutaneous injection technology platforms include vibex disposable pressure assisted auto injectors  vision reusable needle free injectors  and disposable multi use pen injectors 
we currently view pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as our primary customers 
in the injector area  we have licensed our reusable needle free injection device for use with hgh to teva  ferring and jcr 
in august  we announced that teva launched its tjet injector system  which uses our needle free device to administer teva s tev tropin brand hgh 
we have also licensed both disposable auto and pen injection devices to teva for use in undisclosed fields and territories 
in  we received a payment of  from teva for tooling and for an advance for the design  development and purchase of additional tooling and automation equipment  all of which is related to an undisclosed  fixed  single dose  disposable injector product using our vibex auto injector platform 
in addition  we continue to support existing customers of our reusable needle free devices for the home or alternate site administration of insulin in the us market through distributors 
in the gel based area  our lead product candidate  anturol  an oxybutynin atd gel for the treatment of oab  is currently under evaluation in a pivotal phase trial  for which we expect to file an nda in spending on this program in was approximately  and we expect spending in to be approximately  we also have a partnership with biosante that includes libigel transdermal testosterone gel in phase clinical development for the treatment of fsd  and elestrin estradiol gel for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause  and currently marketed in the us we have operating facilities in the us and switzerland 
our us operation manufactures and markets our reusable needle free injection devices and related disposables  and develops our disposable pressure assisted auto injector and pen injector systems 
these operations  including all development and some us administrative activities  are located in minneapolis  minnesota 
we also have operations located in switzerland  which is focused on our transdermal gels and has a number of license agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the application of our drug delivery systems 
our corporate offices are located in ewing  new jersey 
in order to better position ourselves to take advantage of potential growth opportunities and to fund future operations  during we raised additional capital and took steps to reduce our monthly cash obligations 
in the third quarter of  we raised gross proceeds of  through the sale of shares of our common stock and warrants 
we used approximately  of these proceeds to pay off the remaining balance of our credit facility  eliminating our monthly debt service requirements 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our monthly overhead when we entered into an asset purchase agreement with ferring 
under this agreement  ferring assumed responsibility for all of our facility and equipment lease obligations in connection with our operations in switzerland  and the majority of our employees at that location were hired by ferring effective january  subsequent to the ferring agreement we entered into a month to month facility lease agreement at a new swiss location in a much smaller space at a significantly reduced monthly rate 
we have reported net losses of   and  in the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
we have accumulated aggregate net losses from the inception of business through december  of  in addition  we expect to report a net loss for the year ending december  we have not historically generated sufficient revenue to provide the cash needed to support our operations  and have continued to operate primarily by raising capital and incurring debt 
at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of  we believe that the combination of our current cash and cash equivalents balance  our recent reductions in our monthly cash outflows  our projected product sales  product development revenue  license revenues  milestone payments and royalties will provide us with sufficient funds to support operations for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management must make decisions that impact reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are considered by management to be the most critical to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment  with limited judgment required related to product returns 
product sales are shipped fob shipping point 
we also enter into license arrangements that are often complex as they may involve license  development and manufacturing components 
licensing revenue recognition requires significant management judgment to evaluate the effective terms of agreements  our performance commitments and determination of fair value of the various deliverables under the arrangement 
in the third quarter of  we elected early adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables asu with retrospective application to january  asu  which amended fasb asc  multiple element arrangements  is effective for arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   but allows for early adoption 
asu requires a vendor to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
it changes the level of evidence of standalone selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a vendor to make its best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available 
as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  adoption of this accounting pronouncement in resulted in the recognition of revenue deferred in prior years of  and the recognition of costs previously deferred of  in connection with one of our license  development and supply agreements with teva that became subject to the new accounting pronouncement after a material modification to the agreement occurred 
as a result of adoption of asu  deferred revenues and deferred costs associated with this agreement with teva will be recognized as revenues and expenses earlier than would otherwise have occurred 
we also expect revenues and expenses generated in connection with future multiple element arrangements will often be recognized over shorter periods than would have occurred prior to adoption of asu we have a number of arrangements that were not affected by adoption of asu  and the accounting for these arrangements will continue under the prior accounting standards unless an arrangement is materially modified  as defined in the new accounting standard 
the prior accounting standards address when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
our ability or inability to establish objective evidence of fair value for the deliverable portions of the contracts significantly impacted the time period over which revenues are being recognized 
for instance  if there was no objective fair value of undelivered elements of a contract  then we were required to treat a multi deliverable contract as one unit of accounting  resulting in all revenue being deferred and recognized over the entire contract period 
we have deferred significant revenue amounts  at december  where non refundable cash payments have been received  but the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the long term nature of the respective agreements 
subsequent factors affecting the initial estimate of the effective terms of agreements could either increase or decrease the period over which the deferred revenue is recognized 
due to the requirement to defer significant amounts of revenue and the extended period over which the revenue will be recognized  along with the requirement to recognize certain deferred development costs over an extended period of time  revenue recognized and cost of revenue may be materially different from cash flows 
on an overall basis  our reported revenues can differ significantly from billings and or accrued billings based on terms in agreements with customers 
the table below is presented to help explain the impact of the deferral of revenue on reported revenues  and is not meant to be a substitute for accounting or presentation requirements under us generally accepted accounting principles 
product sales development fees licensing fees and milestone payments royalties billings received and or accrued per contract terms deferred billings received and or accrued deferred revenue recognized amortization of prepaid license discount total revenue as reported valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets  including patent rights  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
this analysis can be very subjective as we rely upon signed distribution or license agreements with variable cash flows to substantiate the recoverability of long lived assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
each year we review patent costs for impairment and identify patents related to products for which there are no signed distribution or license agreements or for which no revenues or cash flows are anticipated 
in  we recognized impairment charges of  in general and administrative expenses  which represented the gross carrying amount  net of accumulated amortization  for the identified patents 
no impairment charges were recognized in or the impairment charge relates to the amendment to the agreement with eli lilly and co 
lilly discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of patents  which are our only intangible assets subject to amortization  were  and  at december  and were  and  at december  the estimated aggregate patent amortization expense for the next five years is     and  in    and we have  of goodwill recorded as of december  that relates to our minnesota operations 
we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or a sustained significant drop in our stock price 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the minnesota operations to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the minnesota operations exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the minnesota operations would be allocated to all of its other assets and liabilities based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of the minnesota operations over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during  and resulted in no impairment losses 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and product sales include sales of reusable needle free injector devices  related parts  disposable components  and repairs 
in  and  revenue from sales of needle free injector devices totaled   and  sales of disposable components in  and totaled   and  the increase in device sales and decrease in sales of disposable components was primarily a result of the combination of first year sales to teva in connection with teva s launch of our tjet needle free device with their hgh tev tropin and a decrease in sales to ferring 
device sales to teva exceeded the decrease in device sales to ferring  while the decrease in sales of disposable components to ferring exceeded sales of disposable components to teva 
product sales in compared to were relatively unchanged  due primarily to ferring sales being approximately the same each year 
we believe ferring sales fluctuations from quarter to quarter and the decrease from the prior year are driven mainly by ferring inventory management practices and we expect product sales to ferring to normalize in the first quarter of development revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and the increase in compared to was primarily due to auto injector development work under a license  development and supply agreement with teva originally signed in july in  in connection with an amendment to this license  development and supply agreement  teva purchased tooling in process from us that had a carrying value of approximately  and paid us in advance for the design  development and purchase of additional tooling and automation equipment 
we received a payment under this amendment in the amount of  all of which was initially recorded as deferred revenue 
approximately  of the development revenue recognized in was related to work done under this teva agreement  as amended 
the balance of the revenue in of approximately  and the revenue was attributable primarily to projects related to our proprietary atd gel technology 
the revenue in was attributable primarily to an agreement related to our oral disintegrating tablet technology  along with recognized revenue in connection with our proprietary atd gel technology 
licensing revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and licensing revenue in included approximately  recognized that had been previously deferred and represents a portion of payments received from teva under a license  development and supply agreement for a product utilizing our auto injector technology 
this revenue was recognized as a result of adopting a new revenue recognition accounting standard  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the licensing revenue in also included a milestone payment received from teva in connection with teva s launch of our tjet needle free device with their hgh tev tropin 
in addition  in we recognized licensing revenue of approximately  in connection with a license agreement with ferring executed in november  described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  which included an upfront payment and milestone payments 
also in  approximately  of a previously deferred license fee related to our oral disintegrating tablet technology was recognized after the customer terminated the agreement due to technical challenges with their drug molecule 
the licensing revenue in and included  and  respectively  received under sublicense arrangements related to an existing license agreement with biosante related to elestrin formerly bio e gel 
the remaining licensing revenue in each year is primarily due to recognizing portions of previously deferred amounts related to upfront license fees or milestone payments received under various agreements 
royalty revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and nearly all royalty revenue has been related to our reusable needle free injection device  and has been generated primarily under the license agreement with ferring described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
royalties from ferring are earned on device sales and under a provision in the ferring agreement in which royalties are triggered by the achievement of certain quality standards 
the increase in compared to was partially due to an increase in the royalty from ferring related to the achievement of certain quality standards and partially due to an increase in royalties from biosante related to elestrin 
the increase in compared to was primarily related to the increase in the number of injector devices sold to ferring 
total revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in development revenue related to auto injector development work under a license  development and supply agreement with teva 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to  received in under a sublicense arrangement related to an existing license agreement with biosante 
cost of revenues and gross margins the costs of product sales are primarily related to reusable injection devices and disposable components 
cost of product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  representing gross margins of  and  respectively 
the gross margin increase in from was primarily due to an inventory write down in  along with a combined impact of other factors including selling price increases  changes in the mix of products sold  and variations in exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar which can affect our gross margins realized on a portion of our product sales to ferring 
the cost of development revenue consists of labor costs  direct external costs and an allocation of certain overhead expenses based on actual costs and time spent in these revenue generating activities 
cost of development revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and the significant increase in compared to and was due to development costs recognized related to a license  development and supply agreement with teva for a product utilizing our auto injector technology 
approximately  of the development costs in were previously deferred costs recognized after adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
development costs that were being deferred in connection with the teva agreement were related to both licensing and development revenue that had been deferred 
an additional  of development costs were recognized in in connection with revenue recognized related to the teva agreement 
the remaining development costs in of approximately  and the development costs in were attributable primarily to projects related to our proprietary atd gel technology  while the majority of development costs in were incurred in connection with an agreement involving our oral disintegrating tablet technology 
impairment of prepaid license discount of  partially offset by recognizing deferred revenue net of deferred costs  resulted in a net non cash impairment charge of  in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we determined it was unlikely that future cash flows from a license agreement with lilly would exceed the unamortized prepaid license discount recorded as contra equity in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
in addition  we determined that the carrying amount of related capitalized patent costs of  was impaired  and was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
research and development the majority of research and development expenses consist of external costs for studies and analysis activities  design work and prototype development 
while we are typically engaged in research and development activities involving each of our drug delivery platforms  over of the total research and development expenses in each year were generated in connection with projects related to our transdermal gel products 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and although the total research and development expense in increased only slightly compared to  the costs directly associated with the phase iii study of anturol increased by approximately  to  while costs associated with certain other projects decreased 
the increase in compared to was mainly due to an increase of approximately  in expenses related to the phase iii study of anturol and an increase of approximately  in connection with establishing an internal clinical and regulatory department in early sales  marketing and business development sales  marketing and business development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and the decrease in is primarily due to reductions in payroll costs associated with headcount reductions 
in  increases in expenses related to marketing research were offset by decreases in legal expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and the decrease in compared to and the increase in compared to was mainly due to the expense in associated with a separation agreement with jack stover  our former chief executive officer  and the hiring of paul wotton who started as chief operating officer in july of and was appointed chief executive officer in october the decrease in compared to was also impacted by a decrease in overhead costs and patent related expenses 
the increase in compared to due mainly to payroll cost increases was partially offset by a reduction in patent impairment charges from approximately  in to zero in other income expense other income expense  net  was   and  for the years ended december   and in  interest income decreased to  from  in  due to a reduction in market interest rates received on invested funds and a lower average cash balance 
interest expense decreased in to  from  in due primarily to a lower average principal balance of our credit facility in compared to and due to the retirement of our credit facility in the change to expense in from income in was due to a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense 
in  interest income decreased to  from  in due primarily to a reduction in market interest rates received on invested funds 
interest expense increased in to  from  in in connection with notes payable that originated in the first and fourth quarters of that were outstanding for the full year of liquidity and capital resources we have reported net losses of   and  in the fiscal years ended  and we have accumulated aggregate net losses from the inception of business through december  of  in addition  we expect to report a net loss for the year ending december  we have not historically generated  and do not currently generate  enough revenue to provide the cash needed to support our operations  and have continued to operate primarily by raising capital and incurring debt 
in our annual report on form k we disclosed there was uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in we resolved this uncertainty 
in order to better position ourselves to take advantage of potential growth opportunities and to fund future operations  during we raised additional capital and took steps to reduce our monthly cash obligations 
in july  we raised gross proceeds of  in a registered direct offering through the sale of shares of our common stock and warrants 
we sold a total of  units  each unit consisting of i one share of common stock and ii one warrant to purchase of a share of common stock or a total of  shares  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants will be exercisable six months after issuance at per share and will expire five years from the date of issuance 
in september  we raised gross proceeds of  through the sale of  units to certain institutional investors  each unit consisting of i one share of common stock and ii one warrant to purchase of a share of common stock or a total of  shares  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants will be exercisable six months after issuance at per share and will expire five years from the date of issuance 
the proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in september were used to pay off the remaining balance of our credit facility  reducing our monthly debt service requirements 
the credit facility had originated in  when we received gross proceeds of  in two tranches of  and  to help fund working capital needs 
the per annum interest rate was in the case of the first tranche and in the case of the second tranche 
the maturity date i with respect to the first tranche was forty two months from february and ii with respect to the second tranche was thirty six months from december in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our monthly overhead when we entered into an asset purchase agreement with ferring 
under this agreement  ferring assumed responsibility for all of our facility and equipment lease obligations in connection with our operations in switzerland  and the majority of our employees at that location were hired by ferring effective january  subsequent to the ferring agreement we entered into a month to month facility lease agreement at a new swiss location in a much smaller space at a significantly reduced monthly rate 
at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of  we believe that the combination of our current cash and cash equivalents balance and projected product sales  product development  license revenues  milestone payments and royalties will provide us with sufficient funds to support operations for at least the next months 
we do not currently have any bank credit lines 
in the future  if we need additional financing and are unable to obtain such financing when needed  or obtain it on favorable terms  we may be required to curtail development of new products  limit expansion of operations or accept financing terms that are not as attractive as we may desire 
net cash used in operating activities operating cash inflows are generated primarily from product sales  license and development fees and royalties 
operating cash outflows consist principally of expenditures for manufacturing costs  general and administrative costs  research and development projects and sales  marketing and business development activities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and net operating cash outflows were primarily the result of net losses of   and  in  and  adjusted by noncash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in  the net loss decreased by  to  from  in primarily as a result of an increase in gross profit of  and decreases in general and administrative expenses of  and sales marketing and business development expenses of in  the net loss increased by  to  from  in this increase was due to a number of factors which consisted primarily of the following an increase in research and development expenses of approximately  related mainly to the anturol phase iii trial  a decrease in gross profit of approximately  due mainly to a reduction in licensing revenue from biosante of approximately  which was partially offset by a reduction in cost of revenue of approximately  related to impairment charges recognized in in connection with the lilly agreement  an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately a decrease in interest income of approximately  and an increase in interest expense of approximately  noncash expenses totaled   and  in  and the decrease in compared to was primarily due to reductions in depreciation and amortization of  and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of  and a gain on disposal of equipment  molds  furniture and fixtures of  the decrease in compared to was mainly due to the impairment charges in related to the lilly license agreement  including the prepaid license discount impairment and amortization charge of  and the patent rights impairment charge of in  the change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of  this was mainly the result of payments received from teva and ferring under license and development agreements  much of which was recorded as deferred revenue which increased by  in other operating assets and liabilities changed by a net of  with the most significant change being a decrease in deferred costs of  due mainly to costs recognized in connection with development revenue recognized under a license  development and supply agreement with teva for a product utilizing our auto injector technology 
in  the change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of  changes resulting in the generation of cash included increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
accounts payable increased by  primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the phase iii study of anturol 
deferred revenue increased by  due primarily to payments received and deferred in connection with injector device development projects 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due to a reduction in prepaid expenses related to the phase iii study of anturol 
changes resulting in the use of cash included increases in accounts receivable and other assets 
accounts receivable increased by  primarily due to invoices generated in december related to injector device projects 
deferred costs increased by  due to costs incurred and deferred related to injector device projects 
in  the change in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of  this was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of  which was mainly the result of eliminating the deferred revenue related to the lilly agreement 
other changes included increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  and deferred costs of  which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of  and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of  the increases in prepaid expenses and deferred costs were the result of costs incurred in connection with development projects related mainly to injector devices and anturol 
the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to compensation related accruals such as bonuses  along with accruals for project costs and certain professional fees 
net cash provided by used in investing activities in  cash used in investing activities was  consisting of additions to patent rights of  purchases of equipment  molds  furniture and fixtures of  and net of proceeds from sales of equipment  molds  furniture and fixtures of  investing activities in and were comprised primarily of short term investment purchases and maturities 
all short term investments were commercial paper or us government agency discount notes that matured within six to twelve months of purchase and were classified as held to maturity because we had the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
in  as short term investments matured  the proceeds of  were either used to fund operations or were invested in a money market account with an interest rate that equaled or exceeded interest rates available on most short term investments as market interest rates were decreasing during the year 
in  the use of cash to purchase securities exceeded cash generated from maturities by  due to availability of funds for investment provided primarily by the private placement and the debt financing 
investing activities in and also included additions to patent rights of  and  and purchases of equipment  molds  furniture and fixtures of  and  the purchases of equipment  molds  furniture and fixtures were primarily for tooling and production equipment related to commercial injector device deals with teva 
net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities totaled   and  for the years ended december   and in  we received net proceeds of  from the sale of common stock and warrants  we made payments on long term debt of  and we received  from the exercise of warrants and stock options 
in  principal payments on long term debt totaled  and proceeds received from the exercise of warrants totaled  in  we received net proceeds of  from the private placement of common stock in which a total of  shares of common stock were sold at a price of per share 
in addition  in we received proceeds of  from the exercise of warrants and stock options and received proceeds of  from debt financings 
in  cash was used for debt principal payments and debt issuance costs  which totaled  and  respectively 
our contractual cash obligations at december  are associated with operating leases and are summarized in the following table payment due by period total less than year years years after years total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  including any arrangements with any structured finance  special purpose or variable interest entities 
research and development programs during  our research and development activities were primarily related to anturol and device development projects 
anturol 
we are currently evaluating anturol for the treatment of oab overactive bladder 
in the fourth quarter of we initiated a phase iii pivotal trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of anturol when administered topically once daily for weeks in patients predominantly with urge incontinence episodes 
the randomized  double blind  parallel  placebo controlled  multi center trial is expected to involve patients per arm using two dose strengths selected from the phase ii clinical trial versus a placebo 
enrollment expanded to approximately sixty centers throughout the united states in in addition to the phase iii trial  we have incurred significant costs related to anturol manufacturing development 
we have contracted with patheon  inc patheon  a manufacturing development company  to supply clinical quantities of anturol and to develop a commercial manufacturing process for anturol 
with patheon  we have completed limited commercial scale up activities associated with anturol manufacturing 
as of december   we have incurred total external costs of approximately  in connection with our anturol research and development  of which approximately  was incurred in the year ended december  we intend to seek a marketing partner to help fund the development of anturol and to commercially launch anturol if approved by the fda 
to date  we have not entered into an agreement with a marketing partner 
however  in the third quarter of  we raised gross proceeds of  through the sale of shares of our common stock and warrants 
because of the additional funding received  we will continue the anturol development program and expect total expenses for anturol to be approximately  in although the phase iii program for anturol will continue  the rate of progress of the program will be determined by the level of expenditures  which may be affected by the timing of engaging a marketing partner 
device development projects 
we are engaged in research and development activities related to our vibex disposable pressure assisted auto injectors and our disposable pen injectors 
we have signed license agreements with teva for our vibex system for two undisclosed products and for our pen injector device for two undisclosed products 
our pressure assisted auto injectors are designed to deliver drugs by injection from single dose prefilled syringes 
the auto injectors are in the advanced commercial stage of development 
the disposable pen injector device is designed to deliver drugs by injection through needles from multi dose cartridges 
the disposable pen is in the early stage of development where devices are being evaluated in clinical studies 
our development programs consist of determination of the device design  development of prototype tooling  production of prototype devices for testing and clinical studies  performance of clinical studies  and development of commercial tooling and assembly 
as of december   we have incurred total external costs of approximately  in connection with research and development activities associated with our auto and pen injectors  of which approximately  was incurred in the year ended december  as of december   approximately  of the total costs of  had been deferred  of which approximately  has been recognized as cost of sales and  remains deferred 
this remaining deferred balance will be recognized as cost of sales over the same period as the related deferred revenue will be recognized 
the development timelines of the auto and pen injectors related to the teva products are controlled by teva 
we expect development related to the teva products to continue in  but the timing and extent of near term future development will be dependent on certain decisions made by teva 
in we received a payment from teva in the amount of  in connection with an amendment to a license  development and supply agreement signed in july related to an undisclosed  fixed  single dose  disposable injector product using our vibex auto injector platform 
although this payment and certain upfront and milestone payments have been received from teva  there have been no commercial sales from the auto injector or pen injector programs  timelines have been extended and there can be no assurance that there ever will be commercial sales or future milestone payments under these agreements 
other research and development costs 
in addition to the anturol project and teva related device development projects  we incur direct costs in connection with other research and development projects related to our technologies and indirect costs that include salaries  administrative and other overhead costs of managing our research and development projects 
total other research and development costs were approximately  for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the swiss franc to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of our subsidiaries in switzerland are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds to our swiss subsidiaries in swiss francs 
in addition  we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the us dollar in connection with the licensing agreement entered into in january with ferring  which established pricing in euros for products sold under the supply agreement and for all royalties 
in march  we amended the agreement with ferring  establishing prices in us dollars rather than euros for certain products  reducing the exchange rate risk 
most of our sales and licensing fees are denominated in us dollars  thereby significantly mitigating the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on trade receivables 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk 
because exposure increases as intercompany balances grow  we will continue to evaluate the need to initiate hedging programs to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany balances 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results for the years ended december   and was not material 
typically  our short term investments are commercial paper or us government agency discount notes that mature within six to twelve months of purchase 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument is expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and to the extent possible  will continue in the future  to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
we had no short term investments at december
