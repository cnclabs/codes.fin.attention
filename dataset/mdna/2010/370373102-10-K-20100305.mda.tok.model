item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations constitutes management s review of the factors that affected our financial and operating performance for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a development stage company and began the development of the mt 
hope project on october  during the year ended december  we also completed work on a pre feasibility study of our liberty property 
we continue to approach the liberty property in a care and maintenance mode  and do not expect to spend appreciable amounts of capital on the liberty property until market conditions warrant its development 
the development of the mt 
hope project has a project capital estimate of  million including development costs of approximately  million in dollars and million in cash financial assurance requirements and pre payments 
these amounts do not include financing costs or amounts necessary to fund operating working capital 
through the year ended december   we have spent approximately million and have million remaining cash on hand for use in the development of the mt 
hope project and other cash requirements 
given the continued uncertainty in the project finance market  low molybdenum prices of approximately per pound at the time  and a longer than expected timeframe to receive the federal permits to begin construction at the mt 
hope project  on march   we implemented a cash conservation plan to reduce expenditures and conserve cash for and in order to maximize financial flexibility 
in addition to conserving cash  the plans implemented seek to retain critical employees  and will retain the ability to start construction at the mt 
hope project pending continued improvements in the molybdenum and capital markets 
with our december  consolidated cash balance of million  we have the capacity to continue our current level of permitting efforts  maintain efforts to secure project financing  and secure the most critical long lead equipment for the ultimate construction of the mt 
hope project without accessing new sources of financing through the end of while maintaining the current cash conservation strategy 

table of contents once financing is obtained and we have received the major operating permits and the rod from the blm  it is expected that mt 
hope can be constructed and in production within months 
in the interim  our permitting efforts are continuing full time 
the company has maintained its orders for grinding  milling  and other specialty long lead equipment  although other engineering  administrative and third party work has been slowed or suspended 
we will continue to work with credit suisse and barclays to seek project financing 
during the second quarter of  the company engaged cutfield freeman co  a london based financial advisory firm  to assist the company in primarily seeking bi lateral agency and off take supported financing to potentially augment the projected bank financing 
we will continue evaluating all sources of capital  including equity partners at the corporate or asset level and vendor financing 
given our strong off take agreements and other preparatory work completed  we believe the company is well positioned to execute a project finance facility upon the receipt of the rod  and as credit conditions and the molybdenum price continue to improve 
the worldwide molybdenum price has fluctuated between per pound in to over per pound in in  molybdenum prices averaged per pound 
molybdenum prices fell substantially between october and april from approximately per pound to per pound 
following april  prices slowly rose to a high of over per pound in august before retreating to per pound in october and then rising to finish at approximately per pound 
this year  molybdenum prices have generally traded up  and were approximately per pound in february restructuring and suspension of project development as discussed above  we implemented a cash conservation plan whereby total cash utilization other than equipment purchases has declined to approximately million per month 
based on our current cash on hand and our cash conservation plan  the company expects it will have adequate liquidity for operations  as modified  through the end of without accessing new sources of financing 
engineering efforts  approximately complete  have been largely suspended pending the completion of financing 
some engineering that is critical for permitting or project restart readiness  has continued at a slower pace 
the company issued purchase orders for two types of equipment milling process equipment and mining equipment 
most equipment orders for the custom built grinding and other milling process equipment will be completed by the manufacturers and stored 
the grinding and milling process equipment require the longest lead times and maintaining these orders is critical to the company s ability to re start the development of mt 
hope rapidly 
fabrication of less critical equipment has been suspended with some manufacturers 
with respect to the remaining milling process equipment  where schedule is not critical  the manufacturers have agreed to suspend fabrication of the equipment 
the company has substantially completed negotiation with other equipment manufacturers to suspend or terminate fabrication of other milling equipment and to determine the equipment fabrication costs incurred to date  storage costs  and the expected timing of restarting fabrication 
based on our current plan  expected timetable  and the results of such negotiations  we expect to make additional payments towards purchase of this equipment of approximately million under milling process equipment orders through the end of  with the majority of such spending concentrated in the first half of the year  and million in as additional financing is secured and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under the then current market terms and conditions  as necessary 
the drills and loaders for the mine operation have been cancelled  and discussions for the purchase of the electric shovels are complete and this order was amended and remains in effect 
an agreement has been reached with a truck manufacturer to hold production slots for timely delivery 
the lead times and pricing associated with many of these items have declined from levels 
once financing is secured  the company anticipates placing orders for this mining equipment again 
the company will continue to evaluate all options to decrease mt 
hope s initial capital requirement and facilitate a timely re start of the project development 
the cash conservation plan also impacted general moly employees and contractor support 
in march  the company initiated plans to reduce administrative expenses by million per year through a combination of compensation restructuring and position eliminations 

table of contents the mt 
hope llc agreement effective as of january   we contributed all of our interest in the assets related to the mt 
hope project  including the mt 
hope lease  to the llc  and in february entered into the llc agreement with pos minerals 
under the terms of the llc agreement  pos minerals owns a interest in the llc  and general moly  through a subsidiary  owns an interest 
these ownership interests and or the required contributions under the llc agreement can change as discussed below 
pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement  pos minerals made its initial contributions to the llc totaling million during the year ended december  additional amounts will be due from pos minerals within days after the date the rod contribution conditions have been satisfied 
the rod contribution conditions are the receipt of major operating permits for the project  the rod has become effective  and any administrative or judicial appeals with respect thereto are final 
see permitting update above for a discussion of the status of permitting 
as a result of the rod contribution date not occurring on or before december   the llc agreement allows pos minerals to elect ownership election to either retain its share by contributing an additional million plus its share of all project costs incurred from the closing date to the rod contribution date or reduce its ownership interest to and fund its remaining share of all project costs incurred from the closing date to the rod contribution date 
while the original llc agreement required the ownership election to be made prior to january   the company and pos minerals have mutually agreed to extend the time required for the ownership election by days to may  in addition  if commercial production at the mt 
hope project is not achieved by december  for reasons other than a force majeure event  the llc may be required to return to pos minerals a portion of its contributions to the llc  with no corresponding reduction in pos minerals ownership percentage  based on its election made for the ownership election 
based on our current plan and expected timetable  the mt 
hope project will not achieve commercial production by december  if pos minerals elects to retain its interest and makes its additional million contribution  the return of contributions will be million 
if pos minerals elects to retain its interest but does not make its additional million contribution when due on the rod contribution date  its interest will be reduced to and the return of contributions will be zero 
if pos minerals elects to reduce its ownership interest to  the return of contributions will be million 
such return of contributions is required to be made on or prior to january  our subsidiary that holds our interest in the llc is obligated under the terms of the llc agreement to make capital contributions to fund the return of contributions to pos minerals  if required 
if our subsidiary does not make these capital contributions  pos minerals has an election to either take a secured interest in the llc via a loan  or receive an additional interest in the llc of approximately 
in the latter case  our interest in the llc is subject to dilution based on the dilution formula  calculated as a percentage equal to the ratio of times the amount of such unpaid contributions  over the aggregate amount of deemed capital contributions as determined under the llc agreement of both parties to the llc 
at december   the aggregate amount of deemed capital contributions of both parties was million 
furthermore  a provision in the llc agreement permits pos minerals the option to put its interest in the llc to the company s subsidiary  nevada moly  upon a change of control of the company  as defined in the llc agreement  followed by i failure to begin full construction at the llc by the company or the surviving entity before december   or ii failure to use standard mining industry practice in connection with development and operation of the project as contemplated by the parties for a period of twelve months after december  if pos minerals put its interest  nevada moly would be required to purchase the interest for percent of pos minerals contributions to the llc plus percent interest 
the initial contributions of million that were made by pos minerals during were expended by the second quarter of in accordance with the program and budget requirements of the mt 
hope project 
we are required  pursuant to the terms of the llc agreement  to advance funds required to pay costs for the development of the mt 
hope project that exceed the initial contributions until the rod contribution date  at which point the contributions described above to be made by pos minerals will be applied to reimburse us for pos minerals share of such development costs 
all costs incurred after the rod contribution date will be allocated and funded pro rata based on each party s ownership interest 
the interest of a party in the llc that does not make its pro rata capital contributions to fund costs incurred after the rod contribution date is subject to dilution based on the dilution formula 

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and capital requirements year ended december  compared to year ended december  our total consolidated cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash balances for the year ended december  was due primarily to development costs incurred of million  deposits on property plant and equipment totaling million  and general and administrative costs of million 
deposits on property  plant and equipment relate primarily to scheduled payments for long lead time equipment for the mt 
hope project 
see contractual obligations below 
total assets as of december  decreased to million compared to million as of december  primarily as a result the cash portion of the net loss for the year 
as discussed above under permitting and water rights update  we currently anticipate the effectiveness of the rod and the satisfaction of the rod contribution conditions to occur late in the fourth quarter of or early in the first quarter of  but circumstances beyond our control could cause the effectiveness of the rod and or the satisfaction of the rod contribution conditions to be delayed 
as discussed above under restructuring and suspension of project development  we have suspended engineering efforts and mining and most milling process equipment purchases for the mt 
hope project until such time as we can obtain additional financing 
we are continuing to evaluate a number of potential sources for capital  including the possibility of a sale of additional minority interest in the mt 
hope project  additional support from current strategic partners  off take related debt  and debt from private investment groups  as well as the capital markets 
with our cash conservation plan  our non equipment related cash requirements have declined to approximately million per month 
based on our current plan and expected timetable  we expect to make additional payments of approximately million under milling process equipment orders through the end of  with the majority of such spending concentrated in the first half of the year  and million in as additional financing is secured and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under current market terms and conditions  as necessary 
accordingly  based on our current cash on hand and our cash conservation plan  the company expects it will have adequate liquidity for operations through the year ended december  without accessing new sources of financing while maintaining the current cash conservation strategy 
once the rod is effective  additional capital will be required through the commencement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project 
our ability to develop the project is dependent on  among other things  our ability to raise the necessary capital to fund the mt 
hope project both in sufficient amount and in a timely manner 
additionally  if the currently estimated costs of the mt 
hope project are exceeded we will need to raise additional capital to fund such overruns 
the company is currently  and will on an ongoing basis be  pursuing the most efficient sources of funding for the project including  but not limited to  the equity markets  the bank project finance markets and the high yield capital debt markets 
the cash needs for the development of the mt 
hope project require that we or the llc obtain project financing or other significant financing in addition to the capital contributions anticipated to be received from pos minerals 
the aggregate amount of additional financing required for the development of the mt 
hope project  minus the amounts anticipated to be received from pos minerals on the rod contribution date is anticipated to range between million and million depending on the election made by pos minerals concerning its future contributions 
these amounts do not include financing costs or amounts necessary to fund operating working capital 
during  we engaged barclays capital and credit suisse securities usa llc to assist in our efforts to pursue project financing for the mt 
hope project 
in the second quarter of  the company engaged cutfield freeman co  a london based financial advisory firm  to assist the company in primarily seeking bi lateral agency and off take financing to potentially augment the projected bank financing 
our ability to obtain such project and or agency financing depends on the effectiveness and the timing of the rod  the anticipated price of molybdenum  our projected operating costs and the overall state of the economy and the credit markets 
the and disruptions in national and international credit markets have led to volatile conditions 
there is a scarcity of credit and lenders are imposing tighter lending standards and higher interest costs for loans 
our ability to obtain the necessary funding for the mt 
hope project as well as the terms for such funding may be adversely affected by these disruptions in the credit markets 
we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing for the mt 
hope project in a timely manner  on customary or favorable terms  or at all 

table of contents we also require additional capital to maintain our mining claims and other rights related to the liberty property  as well as continue payment of ongoing general and administrative costs associated with supporting our planned operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  additionally we had million of restricted cash that represented the unspent amount of the initial contributions from pos minerals that was available for the continuing development of the mt 
hope project 
our total consolidated cash balance at december  was million 
the increase in our cash balances was due primarily to the receipt of the million in contributions from pos minerals during and net proceeds from exercises of warrants and options of million  less development costs incurred during of million  deposits on property plant and equipment totaling million  general and administrative costs incurred during of and expense items of million incurred for continuing exploration and evaluation of our liberty property 
deposits on property  plant and equipment relate primarily to scheduled payments for long lead time equipment for the mt 
hope project 
see contractual obligations below 
total assets as of december  increased to million compared to million as of december  primarily as a result of the changes discussed in the preceding paragraph 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december  we had a consolidated net loss of million compared with a net loss of million in the same period for for the year ended december  and  exploration and evaluation expenses were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december  we incurred exploration and evaluation costs on the liberty property as we completed a pre feasibility study on the liberty property in april for the year ended december  the liberty property has been on a care and maintenance status  and  accordingly  the resulting exploration and evaluation expenses are considerably lower for the period 
for the year ended december  and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december  restructuring costs resulting from the implementation of our cash conservation plan are included in general and administrative expenses 
in march we incurred costs related to one time employee termination benefits totaling million 
we also incurred approximately million in equipment contract cancellation costs for the year ended december  such costs were a combination of deposits forfeited and costs to cancel contracts 
interest income was nil for the year ended december  compared with million in as a result of substantially lower interest rates and lower cash balances in compared with the corresponding periods in year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december  we had a net loss of million compared with a net loss of million in the same period for for the year ended december  and  exploration and evaluation expenses were million and million  respectively 
during the entire nine months ended september  both our mt 
hope project and our liberty property were in the exploration and evaluation stage 
in october the mt 
hope project advanced to the development stage 
for the year ended december  we incurred exploration and evaluation costs on the liberty property as we completed a pre feasibility study on the liberty property in april for the year ended december  and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december  and we incurred million and million  respectively in non cash equity compensation for management and directors included in the general and administrative expenses above 
the amounts in were significantly higher than in as a greater amount of equity compensation 
table of contents was incurred during the year ended december  as we added new management personnel and directors as part of a reorganization and expansion of the executive team compared with the same period in the cash portion of our general and administrative expense was approximately the same in both periods 
interest income was million for the year ended december  compared with million in as a result of higher cash balances in compared with the corresponding periods in off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase contracts advance royalties and deferral fees provision for post closure reclamation and remediation total assumes that full project financing is obtained during at december   we have contracts to purchase mining equipment comprised of two electric shovels and have cancelled orders for mine drills and loaders 
we have a non binding letter of agreement on haul trucks that establishes our priority for delivery and provides for the then current pricing using market indices upon initiation of an order 
we have active orders with varying stages of fabrication on milling process equipment comprised of two kv primary transformers and substation  a primary crusher  a semi autogenous mill  two ball mills  and various motors for the mills 
we have suspended fabrication on flotation cells  lime slaking equipment  hydrocyclones  and other smaller milling process equipment with the ability to re initiate fabrication at any time 
we have completed negotiations with the manufacturer of two multi hearth molybdenum roasters to terminate its fabrication of this equipment and receive finished goods of the partially completed order 
we plan to re establish a new purchase order with this manufacturer as additional financing is secured and equipment procurement is restarted under then current market terms and conditions 

table of contents the following table sets forth the llc s remaining cash commitments under purchase contracts at december   resulting from the re negotiation and cancelation of certain purchase contracts as discussed above in millions 
period cash commitments under purchase contracts as of december  st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total total cash commitments under purchase contracts are inclusive of million under milling process equipment orders approximately million due through the end of  and million in  and million in mining equipment orders 
we also incurred approximately million in equipment contract cancellation costs during the year ended december  such costs were a combination of deposits forfeited and costs to cancel contracts 
we also estimate that we will be required to pay approximately million in additional insurance and handling costs  related to the custom build grinding and other milling process equipment 
based on our current plan  expected timetable  and the results of such negotiations  we expect to make additional payments of approximately million under these milling process equipment orders through the end of  and million in as additional financing is secured and equipment procurement is restarted  agreements that were suspended or terminated will be renegotiated under the then current market terms and conditions  as necessary 
if the llc does not make payments required under the purchase contracts  it could be subject to claims for breach of contract or to cancellation of the purchase contract 
in addition  we may proceed to selectively suspend  cancel or attempt to renegotiate additional purchase contracts if we are forced to further conserve cash 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
if we cancel or breach any contracts  we will take all appropriate action to minimize any losses  but could be subject to claims or penalties under the contracts or applicable law 
the cancellation of certain key contracts would cause a delay in the commencement of operations  have ramifications under the llc agreement with pos minerals and would add to the cost to develop our interest in the mt 
hope project 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  upon settlement  actual results may differ from estimated amounts 
provision for taxes income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset if management does not believe the company has met the more likely than not standard to allow recognition of such an asset 

table of contents property  plant and equipment the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis is less than the carrying amount of the related asset grouping  asset impairment is considered to exist 
the related impairment loss is measured by comparing estimated future net cash flows on a discounted basis to the carrying amount of the asset 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
to date no such impairments have been identified 
property and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of three to seven years using straight line depreciation 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  the provisions of which  among others  require the recognition of a noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest  as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity for all periods presented 
in addition  the amount of net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income or loss on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
under gaap  certain noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities meet the definition of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments if the ability to redeem the interest is outside of the control of the consolidating entity 
as described in note  the llc agreement permits pos minerals the option to put its interest in the llc to nevada moly upon a change of control  as defined in the llc agreement  followed by i failure to begin full construction at the llc by the company or the surviving entity before december   or ii failure to use standard mining industry practice in connection with development and operation of the project as contemplated by the parties for a period of twelve months after december  as such  the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest has continued to be shown as a separate caption between liabilities and equity mezzanine section 
the carrying value of the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest reflects the investment of the noncontrolling interest  less losses attributable to the interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are a development stage company in the business of the exploration  development and mining of properties primarily containing molybdenum 
as a result  upon commencement of production  our financial performance could be materially affected by fluctuations in the market price of molybdenum and other metals we may mine 
the market prices of metals can fluctuate widely due to a number of factors 
these factors include fluctuations with respect to the rate of inflation  the exchange rates of the us dollar and other currencies  interest rates  global or regional political and economic conditions  banking environment  global and regional demand  production costs  and investor sentiment 
in order to better manage commodity price risk and to seek to reduce the negative impact of fluctuations in prices  we will seek to enter into long term supply contracts 
on december   we entered into a molybdenum supply agreement with arcelormittal that provides for arcelormittal to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
the supply agreement provides for a floor price along with a discount for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years after the commencement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project 
both the floor and threshold levels at which the percentage discounts change are indexed to a producer price index 

table of contents additionally  on may   we entered into a molybdenum supply agreement with seah besteel corporation seah besteel  korea s largest manufacturer of specialty steels  which provides for seah besteel to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
like the arcelormittal supply agreement  the supply agreement with seah besteel provides for a floor price along with staged discounts for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years from the date of first supply under the agreement 
both the floor and threshold levels at which the percentage discounts change are indexed to a producer price index 
on august   the company entered into a molybdenum supply agreement sojitz agreement with sojitz corporation 
the sojitz agreement provides for the supply of million pounds per year of molybdenum for five years  beginning once the mt 
hope project reaches certain minimum commercial production levels 
one million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be subject to a per pound molybdenum floor price and is offset by a flat discount to spot moly prices above the floor 
the remaining million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be sold with reference to spot moly prices without regard to a floor price 
the sojitz agreement includes a provision for cancellation in the event that supply from the mt 
hope project has not begun by january  all three long term supply agreements provide for supply only after commercial production levels are achieved  and no provisions require the company to deliver product or make any payments if commercial production is never achieved  or declines in later periods 
the agreements require that monthly shortfalls be made up only if the company s portion of mt 
hope production is available for delivery  after pos minerals has taken its share 
in no event do these requirements to make up monthly shortfalls become obligations of the company if production does not meet targeted levels 
furthermore  each of the agreements have take or pay provisions that require the buyers to either take delivery of product made available by the company  or to pay as though they had taken delivery pursuant to the term of the agreements 
while we have not used derivative financial instruments in the past  we may elect to enter into derivative financial instruments to manage commodity price risk 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not expect to enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of december   we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of million 
interest rates on short term  highly liquid investments have not changed materially since december  and continue to be or less on an annualized basis 
if and to the extent that these funds were invested in interest bearing instruments during the entire year ended december   a hypothetical point decrease in the rate of interest earned on these funds would reduce interest income to nil for the year ended december
