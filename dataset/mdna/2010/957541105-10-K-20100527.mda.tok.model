all references herein to the term fiscal year shall mean a year ended march of the year specified 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its outside plant systems osplant systems or osp products  particularly the sale of niu products and related products 
the company introduced its first customer networking solutions cns products in fiscal the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal through its conference plus  inc subsidiary 
the company realizes the majority of its revenues from the north american market 
prior to fiscal year  the company conducted its business within two reportable segments of telecom equipment and telecom services 
effective in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company began reporting its financial information within the three reportable segments of cns  osp  and conferenceplus 
in fiscal year  cns and osp products were both manufactured in the aurora manufacturing facility and shared significant resources that were note segregated for financial reporting 
as a result  the company determined that it is impracticable for the company to restate fiscal year to conform to the current operating segments 
in order to provide comparable information  the company has combined the cns and osp segments results for fiscal years and in the cns segment  the company designs  distributes  markets and services a broad range of carrier class broadband products 
the cns family of broadband products enables high speed transport and networking of voice  data  video  and other advanced services 
the products allow service providers to deliver services  content  and applications over existing copper  fiber  coax  and wireless infrastructures 
westell cns products are typically installed in consumer residences or small businesses as a key component of a broadband service package 
cns products 
the company s cns products enable residential customers  small businesses  and small office home office soho users to access and share broadband services on networked computers  telephones  cell phones  televisions  media players  and other networked devices 
a broad offering of networking products and technologies allows the company to address several segments of the service provider market  distinguished by the methods used to deliver their services wireline operators copper and fiber  mobile network operators wireless  cable multi service operators hybrid fiber coax  and integrated carriers that operate as combinations of the other three operators 
in the osp segment  the company designs  distributes  markets and services a broad range of carrier class digital transmission  remote monitoring  power distribution and demarcation products 
the company s osp products offer next generation outdoor cabinets  enclosures  power distribution panels  flexible edge connectors fiber  ethernet and coax  remote monitoring solutions  and ds and ds transmission plugs 
these solutions are optimized for wireless backhaul  service delivery to business enterprise and smart grid applications 
the osp team also provides a value added customized systems integration csi service  offering its customers a single source for complete turnkey solutions  reducing the time to market and expenses incurred through third party contractors and eliminating the need to design  assemble and test on the job site 
our target customers include wireline service providers  wireless service providers  multiple systems operators msos  integrated carrier  utility providers and original equipment manufacturers oems worldwide all known as service providers 
the power distribution and remote monitoring products are designed and provided through the company s noran tel subsidiary located in regina  saskatchewan  canada  which was acquired on january  osp products 
the company s osp products provide service providers with products to transport  maintain and improve the reliability of services delivered over copper and fiber lines in the local access network 
conference plus  inc conferenceplus or cp  founded in  is a full service audio  web and video conferencing company that manages and hosts specific software and applications supporting its conferencing and meeting services 
conferenceplus is a 
table of contents owned subsidiary of the company and manages its conferencing and meeting services through its main operations center in schaumburg  illinois  and a facility in dublin  ireland 
during december  conferenceplus became a wholly owned subsidiary when the company purchased the remaining minority interest 
conferenceplus allows multiple individuals  organizations and or businesses to conduct conference calls using a combination of audio  web and video collaboration and presentations 
conferenceplus offers conference call services that can include a blend of audio  graphics  spreadsheets and other documents that can be carried over and archived on the internet to enhance the traditional audio conference call 
by enabling the sharing of this blend of information  conferenceplus can help organizations increase productivity and save money by reducing travel time  bringing down travel costs  and making it easier for people in remote locations to work together 
conferencing and meeting service technologies also allow organizations and individuals to collect and disseminate information faster  more accurately and without the associated costs of face to face meetings 
these technologies also help companies communicate and collaborate effectively in the face of health and safety threats and other impediments to travel and formal gatherings 
the prices for the products within each market group vary based upon volume  customer specifications and other criteria  and are subject to change due to competition among telecommunications manufacturers and service providers 
increasing competition  in terms of the number of entrants and their size  and increasing scale of the company s customers because of past mergers  continues to exert downward pressure on prices for the company s products 
the company s customer base for its products is highly concentrated and comprised primarily of major us telecommunications service providers telephone companies  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to launch new product lines 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
the company has expanded its product offerings in the cns segment from basic high speed broadband to more sophisticated applications such as voip  in premises networking  wireless wireline convergence  ip multimedia subsystem ims and fmc  and video iptv services 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which could adversely affect short term results of operations 
in view of the company s current reliance on the telecommunications market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in the cns segment  the company is focusing on the evolving broadband demand  which includes increased bandwidth  richer application sets and converged capabilities 
the company has introduced products for both the existing local telephone and fiber network including the ultraline  proline  versalink  and ultraline series which are targeted at the home networking  and small business markets 
the company expects to de emphasize focus on the ultraline series product to concentrate on more profitable initiatives 
the company is also focusing on cost reducing these products  adding new features and functionality to create additional value in these products 
the osp segment has introduced products and services that focus on customer diversification and has changed from being a provider centered on service to regional bell operating companies into a provider with new sales channels including independent operating companies iocs  wireless service providers  msos  utility providers and oems worldwide 
the company acquired of the common stock of noran tel  inc on january  with the addition of noran tel  the company has obtained sales channels for some of its existing products  has added additional transmission products to offer in its existing sales channels and has gained new products in areas of power distribution and remote monitoring 
the company also plans to invest in new product areas to compliment wireless  fiber  and ethernet applications 

table of contents in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company decided to cease the operations of its westell limited entity located in basingstoke  england  to increase efforts to focus on the core businesses of the company 
all employees have been terminated and the facility has been closed 
westell limited is shown as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal year  conferenceplus was informed by its second largest customer that the customer intended to transfer all business to another conferencing provider 
the transition by this customer occurred in the first fiscal quarter of the revenue from this customer was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the conferenceplus segment has been impacted positively by the current economy as limited business travel increases conferencing call volume  but the lower overall employment market has negatively impacted the business 
the fcc determined that audio and video bridging services are equivalent to teleconferencing services and are telecommunications under the telecommunications act of and the universal service first report and order 
due to this fcc ruling  conferenceplus must pay fusf on applicable revenue for services provided on or after october  the fcc allows telecommunications companies to recover the cost of collecting  remitting and reporting fusf fees 
conferenceplus charges its clients an amount equal to what it must remit  plus charges an administrative fee to recover the cost of providing these services 
conferenceplus recorded approximately million and  of revenue for fusf related expenses  which are included in cost of telecom services  during the years ended march  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgments in applying its accounting policies that have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 
inventory reserves the company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reserve for obsolete and potentially obsolete inventory 
the company also evaluates inventory valuation for lower of cost or market concerns 
prices related to future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into non cancellable commitments for the purchase of inventory and long distance telephone services 
the commitments are at market rates 
should there be a significant decline in revenues the company may absorb excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company establishes reserves for potential losses on at risk commitments 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
goodwill and intangibles pursuant to the requirements of fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  as codified in asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at an interim period if indicators of impairment exist 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill of the reporting unit 
table of contents would be considered impaired 
to measure the amount of the impairment loss  the fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology and current like company market transactions 
an impairment charge of approximately million was taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal year at the westell inc reporting unit in the combined equipment segments 
in fiscal year  a million impairment was recorded at the noran tel reporting unit in the osp segment 
no impairment was found in fiscal year on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenue recognition on equipment where software is incidental to the product as a whole or where software is essential to the equipment s functionality and falls under software accounting scope exceptions generally occurs when products are shipped  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met  no significant obligations remain  collection is reasonably assured and warranty can be estimated 
where multiple element arrangements exist  fair value of each element is established using the relative selling price method  which requires the company to use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  reliable third party objective evidence tpe or management s best estimate of selling price  in that order 
the company s ultraline series products are sold primarily to a single customer with contractual provisions that include specified future software enhancements and post customer support pcs to maintain ongoing interoperability within the customer s network 
the company was not able to establish vsoe or tpe for the specified future software enhancements and therefore relied on management s estimates of fair value for each of the multiple elements in the arrangement 
deferred revenue is recorded for undelivered elements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of revenue recognition relating to this product 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation using the provisions of fas revised  share based payments  as codified in asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires the grant date fair value recognition of expense related to employee stock based compensations awards over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of equity based options requires the company to estimate the expected volatility of its stock  the risk free interest rate  expected option term  expected dividend yield and expected forfeitures 
warranty costs most of the company s products carry a limited warranty ranging from one to three years for cns segment products and up to seven years for osp segment products 
the warranty reserve is based on historical sales and cost of repair or replacement trends new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic amendments for certain investment funds and in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
these asu s amend the fasb accounting standards codification for statement see fas effective date below 
effective april   the company adopted fas  amendments to fasb interpretation r 
this statement amends fin r  as codified in asc  to require the company to perform an analysis of existing investments to determine whether variable interest or interests give the company a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a 
table of contents vie as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of significant impact on a variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
it also amends asc to require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
as a result of adoption  the company is no longer considered the primary beneficiary of contineo systems  inc contineo  a variable interest entity for which the company was considered the primary beneficiary and which required the financial performance of contineo to be consolidated in the company s financial statements in fiscal years  and therefore  the company will deconsolidate contineo as of april  the deconsolidation of contineo does not have a material impact on the company s financial statements
