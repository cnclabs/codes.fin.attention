ebitda consists of net income loss  minus interest income  plus interest expense  plus income tax expense  minus income tax benefit  plus depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interest 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on short term investments or cash deposits 
interest expense primarily consists of interest expense for capital leases  long term and short term borrowings 
we use ebitda in addition to income from operations and net income as a measure of operating performance 
however  ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as capital expenditures  tax payments  interest payments  or other working capital 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as an additional measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry  and  on an adjusted basis in determining compliance with the terms of our credit agreement

executive summary we are a technology based education company 
we offer proprietary curriculum and educational services designed to facilitate individualized learning for students in kindergarten through th grade  or k our mission is to maximize a child s potential by providing access to an engaging and effective education  regardless of geographic location or socio economic background 
since our inception  we have invested more than million to develop curriculum and an online learning platform that promotes mastery of core concepts and skills for students of all abilities 
this learning system combines a cognitive research based curriculum with an individualized learning approach well suited for virtual public schools  online public district programs  public charter schools  hybrid programs and private schools that combine varying degrees of online and traditional classroom instruction  and other educational applications 
we increased total average enrollments in the virtual public schools we serve from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  a growth rate of 
these enrollments exclude students in our direct to consumer  private school and international channels as well as our pilot programs 
over the same period  we increased revenues from million to million  a growth rate of  increased operating income from million to operating income of million  a growth rate of  and increased net income k inc from million to net income k inc 
of million  a growth rate of 
also over the same timeframe  we increased ebitda  a non gaap measure see reconciliation on page  from million to million  a growth rate of 
we deliver our learning system to students primarily through virtual public schools and are building an institutional business with sales directly to school districts 
many states have embraced virtual public schools as a means to provide families with a publicly funded alternative to a traditional classroom based education 
we offer virtual schools our proprietary curriculum  online learning platform and varying levels of academic and management services  which can range from targeted programs to complete turnkey solutions 
additionally  without the requirement of a physical classroom  virtual schools can be scaled quickly to accommodate a large dispersed student population  and allow more capital resources to be allocated towards teaching  curriculum and technology rather than towards a physical infrastructure 
for the school year  we will manage schools in states and the district of columbia 
for the most part  these schools are able to enroll students on a statewide basis 
most of these enrollments are in virtual public schools 
we are serving a growing number of hybrid schools the first of which opened in chicago in a hybrid school is a virtual public school that combines the benefits of face to face time for students and teachers in a traditional classroom setting along with the flexibility and individualized learning advantages of online instruction 
in july  through our acquisition of kc distance learning  inc kcdl  we have added the iq academies that serve statewide virtual public schools in six states where we also serve other schools 
also in july  we extended our involvement with traditional classroom settings to the full operational management of a brick and mortar school 
specifically  the delaware department of education contracted with us to assume responsibility for all aspects of the operation of the moyer charter school  and authorized us to serve up to students in grades this contract furthers the use of our learning systems and instructional methods in a traditional classroom setting 
we are serving a growing number of students in programs that typically only accept enrollment from their own district 
these district based alternatives are a response to demand from school districts 
we have established a dedicated sales team to focus on this sector  and through our acquisition of kc distance learning  inc kcdl in july  we have added to this team as well as expanded our course portfolio 
the services we provide to these districts are designed to assist them in launching their own distance learning programs and vary according to the needs of the individual school districts and may include teacher training programs  administrator support and our student account management system 
with our services  districts can offer programs that allow students to participate full time  as their primary school  or part time  supplementing their education with a single elective or core course 
in addition  parents can purchase our curriculum and learning solutions directly to facilitate or supplement their children s education 
in we launched the k international academy  a private school that we operate using our curriculum 
this school is accredited and enables us to deliver our learning system to students in the united states and worldwide 
this school is positioned as a private international school enabling students to interact with others from more than countries 
the k international academy has a branch facility in dubai  operated under a joint venture 
the purpose of the joint venture is to develop and manage the distribution of our learning system in the gulf cooperating countries 
in  we opened sales offices in singapore and switzerland to expand the reach of the k international academy in those regions 
in april  we formed a joint venture with middlebury college known as middlebury interactive languages llc mil to develop online foreign language courses 
we contributed substantially all of the assets in our power glide language courses inc power glide  subsidiary  along with certain intellectual property licenses and cash for a interest in the joint venture 
as a majority owned subsidiary  we will consolidate the financial statements of mil into our financial statements 
middlebury contributed a license to use its school name  its middlebury monterey language academy business and cash for a interest in the joint venture 
we offer these mil courses in our virtual public schools and believe they have wide applicability in online learning 
this new venture will create innovative  online language programs for pre college students and will leverage middlebury s recognized experience in foreign language instruction and k s expertise in online education 
language faculty from middlebury will work with k to develop and manage the academic content of the web based language courses  which k will offer through its online education programs 
the new courses will use features such as animation  music  videos and other elements that immerse students in new languages 
the first courses  beginner french and spanish for high school students  will be offered for the school year 
the joint venture will also expand the middlebury monterey language academy  a language immersion summer program for middle and high school students 
mmla offers arabic  chinese  french  german and spanish at its summer four week residential session at four college campuses 
in july  we acquired all of the stock of kc distance learning  inc kcdl  a provider of online curriculum and public and private virtual education  for approximately million in million non voting shares of a new class of preferred stock series a shares 
if approved by a shareholder vote  these shares are eligible to convert to common stock on a one for one basis 
if converted and outstanding for the full fiscal year ended june   the series a shares would increase our total dilutive shares outstanding by approximately 
the kcdl businesses include aventa learning online curriculum and instruction  the iq academies statewide virtual public charter schools for middle and high school  and the keystone school international online private school 
aventa learning offers to schools and school districts over core  elective and ap courses in grades  from credit recovery courses to full scale virtual school programs  as well as instructional services 
aventa learning is accredited by the northwest association of accredited schools naas 
the keystone school is an online private school for middle and high school students  which is also accredited by the naas 
it was established in and has served over  students from countries 
the school enrolls both full time and part time students and its course offerings are supported by certified teachers 
the iq academies are statewide online public schools that partner with school districts or public charter schools to serve middle and high school students 
iq academies currently operate in kansas  minnesota  nevada  texas  washington  and wisconsin 
with the formation of mil and the addition of kcdl  we believe we have improved our growth potential and the ability to scale our business even further 
we also continue to invest in our logistics  technological infrastructure and financial systems to allow us to more effectively operate a large and growing company that will be able to better serve the educational needs of students domestically and internationally 
our history we were founded in to utilize the advances in technology to provide children access to a high quality public school education regardless of their geographic location or socio economic background 
given the geographic flexibility of technology based education  we believed that the pursuit of this mission could help address the growing concerns regarding the regionalized disparity in the quality of public school education  both in the united states and abroad 
the convergence of these concerns and rapid advances in internet technology created the opportunity to make a significant impact by deploying a high quality learning system on a flexible  online platform 
in september  after months of research and development of our curriculum  we introduced our kindergarten through nd grade offering 
we initially launched our learning system in virtual public schools in pennsylvania and colorado  serving approximately students in the two states combined 
we added new grades and more states over the past seven years 
we have also developed and launched hybrid programs that combine face to face time in the classroom with online instruction 
for the school year  we operated in states as set forth in the table below 
for the school year  we have been approved to operate in massachusetts and michigan bringing the total states were we operate to the following table sets forth the enrollment  grade level  and new state by school year for virtual public schools and hybrid schools approximate total average of states school year enrollment grades offered served new states sy k nd colorado  pennsylvania  sy  k th arkansas  california  idaho  minnesota  ohio sy  k th arizona  florida  utah  wisconsin sy  k th kansas sy  k th texas sy  k th illinois  washington  sy  k th georgia  nevada sy  k th hawaii  indiana  oregon  south carolina sy  k th alaska  oklahoma  virginia  wyoming sy tbd k th massachusetts  michigan these enrollment trends will become less meaningful as we grow the other channels of our business including district sales  private schools  direct to consumer and international 
key aspects and trends of our operations revenues we generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of curriculum  management and technology services to virtual public schools including charter and hybrid schools and are typically supported by contracts of between one to twenty years in duration 
in each of the past five years  more than of our revenues have been derived from this source 
we anticipate that these revenues will continue to represent the bulk of our total revenues over the next months  although we expect this percentage to decline over the longer term as we expand into new distribution channels 
these underlying contracts provide for our support of the student enrollment process  and we execute marketing and recruiting programs designed to create awareness and generate enrollments for many of these schools 
we earn our revenues by providing each student with access to our online lessons and learning kits  often including the use of a personal computer 
in addition  we provide a variety of management  technology and academic support services to these schools  ranging from turnkey end to end management solutions to targeted programs to meet a school s specific needs 
we also generate revenues from sales of our curriculum and services through other channels  including public school districts  private schools  direct to consumer  and international 
we have also piloted our curriculum in a traditional brick and mortar classroom environment 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the nature and extent of the management services provided to the schools and school districts  iii state or district per student funding levels and attendance requirements  iv prices for our products and services  and v growth in our other distribution channels such as direct to consumer  private schools and international 
we define an enrollment as a full time student using our provided courses as their primary curriculum regardless of the nature and extent of the management services we provide to the virtual public school 
generally  students will take five or six courses  except for some kindergarten students who may participate in half day programs 
we count each half day kindergarten student as an enrollment 
school sessions generally begin in august or september and end in may or june 
we consider the duration of a school year to be months 
to ensure that all virtual public school and hybrid schools are reflected in our measure of enrollments  we consider the number of students on the last day of september to be our opening enrollment level  and the number of students enrolled on the last day of may to be our ending enrollment level 
to provide comparability  we do not consider enrollment levels for june  july and august as most schools are not open during these months 
for each period  average enrollments represent the average of the month end enrollment levels for each month that has transpired between september and the end of the period  up to and including the month of may 
we continually evaluate our enrollment levels by state  by school and by grade 
we track new student enrollments and withdrawals throughout the year 
we believe that the number of enrollments depends upon the following the number of states and school districts in which we operate  the restrictive terms of local laws or regulations including enrollment caps  the appeal of our curriculum and instructional model to students and families  the specific local requirements including credit recovery  special needs  the effectiveness of our program in delivering favorable academic outcomes  the quality of the teachers working in the virtual public schools we serve  and the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting programs 
in fiscal year  we increased total average enrollments by  or to  as compared to total average fiscal year enrollments of  we did this by a process that combines replacing students who have withdrawn and adding new enrollments to attain our rate of growth 
we continually evaluate our trends in revenues by monitoring the number of enrollments in total  by state  by school and by grade  assessing the impact of changes in funding levels and the pricing of our curriculum and educational services 
we also sell our courses directly to consumers 
in our direct to consumer channel  consumers typically purchase from one to six courses in a year  however  we do not monitor the progress of these students in the same way as we do in virtual public schools 
our online private school  the k international academy can enroll students on a full or part time basis 
in addition  the brands we acquired from kcdl serve students full time and with single courses 
we have not included the enrollment from these channels in our enrollment totals  however we expect them to have a greater impact on revenues going forward 
our annual growth in revenues may be materially affected by changes in the level of management services we provide to certain schools 
currently a significant portion of our enrollments are associated with virtual public schools to which we provide turnkey management services 
we are responsible for the complete management of these schools and therefore  we recognize as revenues the funds received by the schools  up to the level of costs incurred 
these costs are substantial  as they include the cost of teacher compensation and other ancillary school expenses 
accordingly  enrollments in these schools generate substantially more revenues than enrollments in other schools where we provide limited or no management services 
in these situations  our revenues are limited to invoiced amounts and are independent of the total funds received by the school from a state or district 
as a result  changes in the number of enrollments associated with schools operating under turnkey arrangements relative to total enrollments may have a disproportionate impact on growth in revenues relative to the growth in enrollments 
the percentage of enrollments associated with turnkey management service schools  or managed schools  was for the years ended june  and this was primarily attributable to the added emphasis we have placed on sales to school districts that resulted in growth of these enrollments of  a similar rate as the growth in enrollments at managed schools 
changes in the mix of enrollments associated with turnkey management services compared with limited management services may change the average revenues per enrollment and accordingly impact total revenues 
as we renew our existing management contracts  the extent of the management services we provide may change 
our turnkey management contracts have terms from one to twenty years 
for fiscal year  we are providing turnkey management services to new schools in massachusetts and michigan and have also added several contracts to provide our curriculum and limited services to individual school districts 
as we continue to build our institutional business and increase our sales to school districts  the trend in enrollment mix may continue to shift toward these programs 
in fiscal year  we derived more than of our revenues from each of the ohio virtual academy and the agora cyber charter school in pennsylvania 
in aggregate  these schools accounted for of our total revenues 
we provide our full turnkey management solution pursuant to our contract with the ohio virtual academy  which terminates on june  we provide our full turnkey solution to the agora cyber charter school agora  pursuant to a contract with the school that expires on june  each of the contracts with these schools provides for termination of the agreement if the school ceases to hold a valid and effective charter from the charter issuing authority in their respective states or if there is a material reduction in the per enrollment funding level 
the annual revenues generated under each of these contracts represent a material portion of our total revenues in fiscal year and we expect this to continue in fiscal year in october  as part of a settlement agreement  the pennsylvania department of education pde terminated its charter revocation proceeding against agora 
the settlement agreement also included the dismissal of the two lawsuits brought against us by agora and the cynwyd group  as well as all other related litigation involving agora  cynwyd and the pde 
our annual revenue growth is impacted by changes in state or district per enrollment funding levels 
due to the recession  many states have reduced per enrollment funding for public education affecting many of the virtual public schools we serve 
while the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra has provided additional funds to states  it has not fully offset the state funding reductions 
thus  the net impact to funding was negative in many states and had a negative effect on our revenue and income for our fiscal years and our financial results reflect annual school revenues and expenses  including arra funds  state funding reductions and expense reductions that we undertook in order to mitigate the impact of the funding reductions that have occurred 
in august  the us government passed the education jobs and medicaid assistance act providing billion in federal aid for schools 
at this time  many states still have budget issues and the specific level of federal funding for the coming years is not yet known so it is possible we could experience lower per enrollment funding in the future 
we evaluate the combined pricing of our curriculum and educational services annually against market conditions and state funding levels and change them as we deem appropriate 
we do not expect our price changes to have a significant impact on revenues as they are encompassed within changes in per enrollment funding levels 
instructional costs and services expenses instructional costs and services expenses include expenses directly attributable to the educational products and services we provide 
the virtual public schools we manage are the primary drivers of these costs  including teacher and administrator salaries and benefits and expenses of related support services 
instructional costs also include fulfillment costs of student textbooks and materials  depreciation and reclamation costs of computers provided for student use  and the cost of any third party online courses 
in addition  we include in instructional costs the amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems 
we measure  track and manage instructional costs and services as a percentage of revenues and on a per enrollment basis as these are key indicators of performance and operating efficiency 
as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs and services expenses decreased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
this decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the lower fulfillment costs for materials and computers  increased productivity at the schools we serve  and leverage of fixed school infrastructure costs 
this decrease in expenses was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of high school enrollments relative to total enrollments from to  as high school enrollments have higher costs as a percentage of revenues due to increased teacher and related services costs 
in the near term  we expect high school enrollments to grow as a percentage of total enrollments 
our high school offering requires increased instructional costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our kindergarten to th grade offering 
this is due to the following i generally lower student to teacher ratios  ii higher compensation costs for some teaching positions requiring subject matter expertise  iii ancillary costs for required student support services including college placement  sat preparation and guidance counseling  and vi use of third party courses to augment our proprietary curriculum 
over time  we anticipate partially offsetting these factors by obtaining productivity gains in our high school instructional model  replacing third party high school courses with proprietary content  leveraging our school infrastructure and obtaining purchasing economies of scale 
we have deployed and are continuing to develop new delivery models  including hybrid schools  where students receive face to face instruction in a learning center to complement their online instruction  and other programs that utilize a brick and mortar facility full time  including our operational management of the moyer charter school 
these models necessitate additional costs including facilities related costs and additional administrative support  which are generally not required to operate typical virtual public schools 
in addition  development costs may include instructional research and curriculum development 
as a result  instructional costs as a percentage of revenues may be higher than our fully virtual kindergarten through eighth grade offering 
in addition  we are pursuing expansion into new states 
if we are successful  we will incur start up costs and other expenses associated with the initial launch of a virtual public school  which may result in increased instructional costs as a percentage of revenues 
selling  administrative and other operating expenses selling  administrative and other operating expenses include the salaries  benefits and related costs of employees engaged in business development  sales and marketing  and administrative functions 
in addition  we include rent expense for our corporate headquarters and stock compensation expense 
we also include litigation settlement costs  and transaction and due diligence expenses related to mergers and acquisitions 
we track selling  administrative and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to measure performance and efficiency of these areas 
in addition  we quantify sales and marketing efficiency including the number of new enrollment prospects for virtual public schools  our ability to convert these prospects into enrollments  and our cost effectiveness of conversion 
we also review various call center statistics as indicators of operating efficiency and customer service including call handle rates  waiting time and customer satisfaction 
for fiscal year  our selling  administrative and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were  representing an increase of compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to increases in student recruiting and enrollment  personnel costs including the expansion of our institutional sales force  professional services  acquisition due diligence and closing expenses  and litigation settlement costs 
excluding acquisition due diligence expenses and legal settlement costs incurred in fiscal year  this increase would have been 
we believe we will be able to gain scale integrating the selling and administrative functions of kcdl 
we continue to invest in our logistics  technological infrastructure and financial systems to allow us to more effectively operate a large and growing company that will be able to better serve the educational needs of students domestically and internationally 
product development expenses product development expenses include research and development costs and overhead costs associated with the management of both our curriculum development and internal systems development teams 
in addition  product development expenses include the amortization of internal systems and any related impairment charges 
we measure and track our product development expenditures on a per course or project basis to measure and assess our development efficiency 
in addition  we monitor employee utilization rates to evaluate our workforce efficiency 
we plan to invest in additional curriculum development and related software in the future  primarily to produce additional high school courses  world language courses  new releases of existing courses and to upgrade our content management system and online school 
we capitalize most of the costs incurred to develop our curriculum  beginning with application development  through production and testing into capitalized curriculum development costs 
we capitalize the costs incurred to develop internal systems into property  equipment and capitalized software development costs 
we account for impairment of capitalized curriculum development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no

there were no impairment charges for the year ended june  we recorded impairment charges on capitalized curriculum of million for the year ended june  there were no impairment charges for the years ended june  other factors that may affect comparability year to year stock based compensation expense

we expect stock based compensation expense to increase in the future as we grant additional stock options and restricted stock awards 
income tax expense 
in the period from our inception through fiscal year  we incurred significant operating losses that resulted in a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes 
however  in each of the three years ending june   we generated increasing enrollments  revenue and pre tax income 
as a result  in fiscal year  we determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of our net deferred tax asset would be utilized 
for the year ended june   we recognized a net income tax benefit of million 
this reflects the net effect of a million tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets and an income tax expense of million  or of pretax income 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was million  or of pretax income 
for the year ended june   income tax expense was million  or of pretax income

public funding and regulation 
our public school customers are financed with federal  state and local government funding 
budget appropriations for education at all levels of government are determined through a political process and impacted by general economic conditions  and  as a result  our revenues may be affected by changes in appropriations 
decreases in funding could result in an adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
competition 
providing online education for grades k is becoming increasingly competitive and attracting significant new entrants 
as this competition intensifies  it could negatively effect our growth  revenues and operating margins 
with the introduction of new technologies and entrants  we expect this competition to intensify 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 codified in asc  we recognize revenues when the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of physical goods or rendering of services is complete  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
once these conditions are satisfied  the amount of revenues we record is determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  codified in asc 
we generate almost all of our revenues through long term contracts with virtual public schools and public hybrid schools 
these schools are generally funded by state or local governments on a per student basis 
under these contracts  we are responsible for providing each enrolled student with access to our ols or high school learning platform  our online lessons  learning kits  teachers and student support services required for their complete education 
in most cases  we are also responsible for providing complete management  technology and educational services required for the operation of the school 
the revenues derived from these long term agreements are primarily dependent upon the number of students enrolled  the extent of the management services contracted for by the school  and the level of funding provided to the school for each student 
we have determined that the elements of our contracts are valuable to schools in combination  but do not have standalone value 
while we have sold some of these elements in various combinations or bundles to schools and school districts  the value of each element across these combinations is indeterminable and we have concluded that we do not have sufficient objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each element 
as a result  the elements within our multiple element contracts do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we account for revenues received under multiple element arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement based upon the approximate rate at which we incur the costs associated with each element 
while we have concluded that the elements of our contracts do not have standalone value  we invoice schools in accordance with the established contractual terms and rates 
generally  this means that for each enrolled student  we invoice their school on a per student basis for the following items access to our online school and online lessons  learning kits  and student personal computers 
we also invoice for management and technology services 
we apply sab no 
to each of these items as follows access to the online school and online lessons 
our ols revenues come primarily from contracts with charter schools and school districts 
students are provided access to the ols and online lessons at the start of the school year for which they have enrolled 
on a per student basis  we invoice schools an upfront fee at the beginning of the school year or at the time a student enrolls and a monthly fee for each month during the school year in which the student is enrolled 
a school year generally consists of months 
the upfront fee is initially recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenues ratably over the remaining months of the current school year 
if a student withdraws prior to the end of a school year  any remaining deferred revenue related to the upfront fee is recognized ratably over the remaining months of the school year 
the monthly fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned 
the majority of our enrollments occur at the beginning of the school year in august or september  depending upon the state 
because upfront fees are generally charged at the beginning of the school year  the balance in our deferred revenue account tends to be at its highest point at the end of the first quarter 
generally  the balance will decline over the course of the year and all deferred revenue related to virtual public schools will be fully recognized by the end of our fiscal year on june learning kits 
our learning kit revenues come primarily from contracts with virtual public schools 
the lessons in our online school are meant to be used in conjunction with selected printed materials  workbooks  laboratory materials and other manipulative items which we provide to students 
we generally ship all learning kits to a student when their enrollment is approved and invoice the schools in full or over the school year for the materials 
once materials have been shipped  our efforts are substantially complete 
therefore  we recognize revenues upon shipment 
because learning kits revenues are recognized near the time of enrollment in its entirety  we generate a majority of these revenues in our first fiscal quarter which coincides with the start of the school year 
shipments for virtual public schools that occur in the fourth fiscal quarter that are for the upcoming school year are recorded in deferred revenues 
we may also reclaim materials for schools at the end of the school year or when a student withdraws from the school 
we will invoice a reclamation fee for this service and recognize the revenue in the period it is performed 
we have improved our ability to reclaim materials which has contributed to cost savings and efficiencies in our fulfillment operations 
student personal computers 
in most of our contracts with managed virtual public schools  we are responsible for fulfilling school policies ensuring that each enrolled student has the ability to access our online school 
to accomplish this  we provide many families with the use of a personal computer  complete technical support through our call center  and reclamation services when a student withdraws or a computer needs to be exchanged 
schools are invoiced for each enrolled student or family to whom we have provided a personal computer 
this may include an upfront fee at the beginning of the school year or at the time a student enrolls  a monthly fee for each month during the school year in which the student is enrolled  and a reclamation fee when a student withdraws from the school 
a school year generally consists of months 
the upfront fee is initially recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenues ratably over the remaining months of the current school year 
if a student withdraws prior to the end of a school year  any remaining deferred revenue related to the upfront fee is recognized ratably over the remaining months of the school year 
all deferred revenue will be recognized by the end of our fiscal year  june the monthly fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned 
management  technology and educational services 
under most of our statewide virtual public school contracts  we provide the boards of these schools we serve with turnkey management and technology services 
we take responsibility for all academic and fiscal outcomes 
this includes responsibility for all aspects of the management of the schools  including monitoring academic achievement  teacher recruitment and training  compensation of school personnel  financial management  enrollment processing and provisioning of curriculum  equipment and required services 
management and technology fees are generally determined based upon a percentage of the funding received by the virtual public school 
we generally invoice schools for management and technology services in the month in which they receive such funding 
we recognize the revenues from management  technology and educational services ratably over the course of our fiscal year 
we use months as a basis for recognition because administrative offices of the school remain open for the entire year 
quarter to quarter  we estimate the total funds that each school will receive in a particular school year  and recognize as revenue our pro rata fees associated with the estimated funding 
our management and technology service fees are generally a contracted percentage of yearly school revenues 
we review our estimates of funding periodically  and revise as necessary  amortizing any adjustments over the remaining portion of the fiscal year 
actual school funding may vary from these estimates or revisions  and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our results of operations 
since the end of the school year coincides with the end of our fiscal year  we are generally able to base our annual revenues on actual school revenues 
we closely monitor the financial performance of the schools to which we provide turnkey management services 
under the contracts with these schools  we generally take responsibility for any operating expenses that they may incur in a given school year 
these expenses include our charges for products and services 
in some cases  the school operating expenses may exceed the revenues earned by the school resulting in an operating loss for the school 
a school operating loss may result from a combination of cost increases or funding reductions attributable to the following costs associated with new schools including the initial hiring of teachers  administrators and the establishment of school infrastructure  school requirements to establish contingency reserves  one time costs such as a legal claim  funding reductions due to the inability to qualify specific students for funding  regulatory or academic performance thresholds which may restrict the ability of a school to fund all expenses  inadequate school funding in particular states  and or burdensome regulation creating excessive costs 
we consider an individual school operating loss to estimate any impairment of collection  and our recognized revenue reflects this impairment 
the fact that a school has an operating loss in one year does not necessarily mean we anticipate losing money on the entire contract 
we recognize the impact of a school operating loss by estimating the full year revenues and full year operating expenses of the school at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we amortize the estimated school operating loss against recognized revenues based upon the percentage of actual revenues in the period to total estimated revenues for the fiscal year 
we periodically review our estimates of full year school revenues and full year school operating expenses and amortize the net impact of any changes to these estimates over the remainder of our fiscal year 
actual school operating losses may vary from these estimates or revisions  and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our results of operations 
since the end of the school year coincides with the end of our fiscal year  we are generally able to base our annual revenues on actual school revenues and use actual costs incurred in our calculation of school operating losses 
in aggregate  the operating losses of the schools we manage have grown substantially 
we expect school operating losses to decline in some schools as their enrollment increases and they obtain scale 
in aggregate  we expect school operating losses to continue to grow due to start up costs in new states  additional investment in educational programs  and the higher costs associated with our high school offering 
the amount of revenues we record is determined in accordance with eitf for the schools where we provide turnkey management services  we have determined that we are the primary obligor for substantially all expenses of the school 
accordingly  we report revenues on a gross basis by recording the associated per student revenues received by the school from its funding state or school district up to the expenses incurred by the school 
revenues are recognized when the underlying expenses are incurred by the school 
for the contracts where we provide individually selected services for the school or school district  we invoice on a per course  per student  or per service basis and recognize revenues in accordance with sab no 
under these contracts  where we do not assume responsibility for a school operating loss  we record revenues on a net basis 
we also generate a small percentage of our revenues through the sale of our online courses and learning kits directly to consumers 
online course sales are generally month to month subscriptions or for periods of months and customers have the option of paying a discounted amount in full upfront or paying in monthly installments 
payments are generally made with charge cards 
for those customers electing to pay these subscription fees in their entirety upfront  we record the payment as deferred revenue and amortize the revenues over the life of the subscription 
for customers paying monthly  we recognize these payments as revenues in the month earned 
revenues for learning kits are recognized when shipped 
we currently generate revenues from private schools  including the k international academy 
these revenues are recognized based upon the products or services provided as described above 
capitalized curriculum development costs our curriculum is primarily developed by our employees and to a lesser extent  by independent contractors 
generally  our courses cover traditional subjects and utilize examples and references designed to remain relevant for long periods of time 
the online nature of our curriculum allows us to incorporate user feedback rapidly and make ongoing corrections and improvements 
for these reasons  we believe that our courses  once developed  have an extended useful life  similar to computer software 
we also create textbooks and other offline materials 
our curriculum is integral to our learning system 
our customers do not acquire our curriculum or future rights to it 
due to the similarity in development stages and long economic life of curriculum to computer software  we capitalize curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  codified in asc 
sop provides guidance for the treatment of costs associated with computer software development and defines those costs to be capitalized and those to be expensed 
costs that qualify for capitalization are external direct costs  payroll  and payroll related costs 
costs related to general and administrative functions are not capitalizable and are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize curriculum development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility 
many of our new courses leverage off of proven delivery platforms and are primarily content  which has no technological hurdles 
as a result  a significant portion of our courseware development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of the courseware 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that a course can be produced to meet its design specifications 
capitalization ends when a course is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
capitalized costs are recorded in capitalized curriculum development costs 
the period of time over which these development costs will be amortized is generally five years 
this is consistent with the capitalization period used by others in our industry and corresponds with our product development lifecycle 
included in capitalized curriculum development is the november purchase of a perpetual license of curriculum for million 
the purchase agreement includes a provision for future royalty payments 
this curriculum will be included as part of our high school offering and will be amortized over five years 
software developed or obtained for internal use we develop our own proprietary computer software programs to provide specific functionality to support both our unique education offering and the student and school management services 
these programs enable us to develop courses  process student enrollments  meet state documentation requirements  track student academic progress  deliver online courses to students  coordinate and track the delivery of course specific materials to students and provide teacher support and training 
these applications are integral to our learning system and we continue to enhance existing applications and create new applications 
our customers do not acquire our software or future rights to it 
we capitalize software development costs incurred during the development stage of these applications in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use codified in asc 
these capitalized development costs are included in property  equipment and capitalized software and are generally amortized over three years 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets include property  equipment  capitalized curriculum and software developed or obtained for internal use 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
codified in asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our recorded long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we determine the extent to which an asset may be impaired based upon our expectation of the asset s future usability as well as on a reasonable assurance that the future cash flows associated with the asset will be in excess of its carrying amount 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
there was no impairment for the years ended june   and accounting for stock based compensation effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas no 
r only to awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized beginning july  is based on the fair value of stock awards as of the grant date 
as we had used the minimum value method for valuing its stock options under the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 all options granted prior to july  continue to be accounted for under apb no 
we use the black scholes option pricing model method to calculate the fair value of stock options 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of the option 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees  primarily non employee directors  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we account for income taxes as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes codified in asc 
sfas no 
prescribes the use of the asset and liability method to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts  using currently enacted tax laws 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established  based on the weight of available evidence  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of sufficient future taxable income 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
however  our ability to forecast sufficient future taxable income is subject to certain market factors that we may not be able to control such as a material reduction in per pupil funding levels  legislative budget cuts reducing or eliminating the products and services we provide and government regulation 
from inception through fiscal year  we had generated significant losses 
however  in the three years ending june  we generated increasing operating profit 
in addition  our revenues are dependent  among other things  upon the number of student enrollments 
during the recruiting season for fall  we received enrollment applications that would provide for additional growth for fiscal year when considering this positive evidence of future profitability  we believed that our recent history of generating positive pre tax income is sustainable and is expected to continue to grow as a result of the increasing revenues primarily from virtual public schools 
consequently  as we believed that it is more likely than not that we would be able to utilize substantially all of our net deferred tax asset  we reversed approximately million of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset for the year ended june  although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
as of june   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that expire between and if unused 
we maintain a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of million as of june  related to state income taxes as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize these deferred tax assets 
due to these net operating loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes in the next twelve months 
goodwill and other intangibles we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
finite lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations subject to amortization are recorded at their fair value in accordance with asu topic finite lived intangible assets include the trade name customer contracts and non compete agreements 
such intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
as of june  and  finite lived intangible assets are recorded at million and million  respectively and accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively 
amortization expense for the years ended june   and were million  million and million  respectively 
future amortization of intangible assets is not yet determinable until a final allocation is completed identifying the finite lived intangibles and corresponding useful life contributed to the middlebury interactive languages venture 
as of june  and  indefinite lived intangible assets  which consist of a domain name  are recorded for both years at million 
statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  codified in asc  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives  which is performed annually  as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred 
the first step tests for impairment  while the second step  if necessary  measures the impairment 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or earlier when events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
we have elected to perform our annual assessment on may st of each year 
for the year ended june    and no impairment to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets was recorded 
consolidation of noncontrolling interest our consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations of our middle east and middlebury interactive languages joint ventures 
earnings or losses attributable to our partner are classified as net income or net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of operations 
net income or net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest adjusts our consolidated net results of operations to reflect only our share of the after tax earnings or losses of an affiliated company 
income taxes attributable to minority interest are determined using the applicable statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions where such operations are conducted 
redeemable noncontrolling interest in the formation of our joint venture with middlebury college  at any time after the fifth th anniversary of the agreement  middlebury may give written notice of its irrevocable election to sell all but not less than all of its membership interest to the company put right 
the purchase price for middlebury s membership interest shall be its fair market value and the company may  in its sole discretion  pay the purchase price in cash or shares of the company s common stock 
the agreement also includes a provision whereby  if certain milestones are not met related to expanding the business by june  middlebury will have the option to repurchase certain contributed assets at their fair market value 
the transaction resulted in a change in ownership interest of the subsidiary that did not result in loss of control and was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with the provisions of asc formerly sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb 
the assets contributed by middlebury were initially recorded at their fair value 
the intangible assets contributed by middlebury were estimated at a fair value of million as determined by us and represents a preliminary allocation which is subject to change upon completion of a valuation with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
given the provision of the put right  the redeemable noncontrolling interest is redeemable outside of our control and it is recorded outside of permanent equity at its redemption value fair value in accordance with eitf topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
we will adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest to redemption value on each balance sheet date with changes in redemption value recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings  or in the absence of retained earnings  by adjustment to additional paid in capital

our revenues for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to revenues of million for the same period in the prior year 
total average enrollments increased to  for the year ended june  from  for the same period prior year 
the increase in average enrollments was primarily attributable to enrollment growth in existing states 
new school openings in alaska  oklahoma  virginia  and wyoming contributed approximately to enrollment growth 
in new and existing states combined  high school enrollments contributed approximately to enrollment growth and k enrollments contributed approximately to overall enrollment growth 
for the year ended june   high school enrollments increased as compared to the same period in the prior year

also contributing to the growth in revenues were other distribution channels including private schools and direct to consumer 
instructional costs and services expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or as compared to instructional costs and services of million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in expenses to operate and manage the schools  partially offset by a million decrease in costs to supply curriculum  books  educational materials and computers to students  including depreciation and amortization 
as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs decreased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
this decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the lower fulfillment costs for materials and computers  increased volume in reclaimed materials  increased productivity at the schools we serve  and leverage of fixed school infrastructure costs 
this decrease in expenses was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of high school enrollments relative to total enrollments from to  as high school enrollments have higher costs as a percentage of revenues due to increased teacher and related services costs 
selling  administrative  and other operating expenses 
selling  administrative  and other operating expenses for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  administrative and other operating expenses of million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs including benefits and stock compensation expense  the expansion of our institutional sales force  student recruiting and enrollment costs  professional services  acquisition due diligence and transaction related costs  and litigation settlement costs 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  administrative  and other operating expenses increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in personnel costs including the expansion of our institutional sales force  student recruiting  professional services  and acquisition due diligence and transaction related costs 
product development expenses 
product development expenses for the years ended june  and were million 
employee compensation combined with contract labor was relatively stable 
we continued to add to our high school course catalogue  including credit recovery programs  and completed our new elementary math program containing custom math sequences to meet state specific needs 
as a percentage of revenues  product development expenses decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the same period in the prior year as we were able to leverage these costs over a larger revenue base 
net interest expense 
net interest expense for the year ended june  was million  as compared to net interest expense of million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to lower interest income as a result of declining interest rates for the year ending june  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was million or of income before income taxes  as compared to an income tax expense of million  or of income before taxes  for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in rate is primarily attributable to tax credits recognized in the year ended june  for research and development activities in the current and prior periods 
without these credits  income tax expense for the year ended june  would have been million or of income before taxes 
noncontrolling interest 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended june  and was million 
noncontrolling interest reflects the after tax losses attributable to shareholders in our joint venture in the middle east and middlebury interactive languages 
comparison of years ended june  and revenues 
our revenues for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to revenues of million for the same period in the prior year 
total average enrollments increased to  for the year ended june  from  for the same period prior year 
the increase in average enrollments was primarily attributable to enrollment growth in existing states 
new school openings in hawaii  indiana  oregon  and south carolina contributed approximately to enrollment growth 
in new and existing states combined  high school enrollments contributed approximately to enrollment growth and k enrollments contributed approximately to overall enrollment growth

k enrollments increased for the year ended june  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
additionally  k enrollments constituted approximately of our enrollments for the year ended june  as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
also contributing to the growth in revenues was the increase in the percentage of enrollments associated with managed schools  which generate higher revenue per enrollment than non managed school enrollments 
the percentage of enrollments associated with managed schools increased to for the year ended june  from for the same period in the prior year 
instructional costs and services expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or as compared to instructional costs and services of million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in expenses to operate and manage the schools and a million increase in costs to supply curriculum  books  educational materials and computers to students  including depreciation and amortization 
as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs increased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the year ended june  this increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to four factors an increase in the percentage of managed school enrollments relative to total enrollments from to 
managed school enrollments generate more revenue than those associated with non managed schools  but have higher instructional costs as a percentage of revenues  an increase in the percentage of high school enrollments relative to total enrollments from to 
high school enrollments have higher costs as a percentage of revenues due to increased teacher and related services costs  incremental freight charges due to expedited student materials shipments and fuel surcharges  partially offset by reduced costs of student materials and computers  and start up costs associated with the commencement of school operations in four new states and two new schools in existing states 
selling  administrative  and other operating expenses 
selling  administrative  and other operating expenses for year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  administrative and other operating expenses of million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in student recruiting costs  a million increase in professional services  and a million increase in other expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  administrative  and other operating expenses decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the same period in the prior year primarily due to greater leverage on our corporate overhead and fixed selling resources 
partially offsetting this leverage were increased investments in demand generating activities and our international expansion efforts 
product development expenses 
product development expenses for the years ended june  and were million 
employee compensation as well as contract labor costs increased  but were offset by greater utilization of these resources to develop curriculum assets 
we continued to add to our high school course catalogue and to our elementary math and remedial reading programs 
as a percentage of revenues  product development expenses decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the same period in the prior year as we were able to leverage these costs over a larger revenue base 
net interest expense 
net interest expense for the year ended june  was million  as compared to net interest expense of million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is due to growth in our capital lease obligations partially offset by reduced borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
in addition  although our average cash balances were higher for the year ended june   the significant decline in interest rates resulted in lower interest income 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was million  or of income before income taxes  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the same period in the prior year 
the income tax benefit for the year ended june  reflects a million tax benefit as we were able to reverse the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets generated by our net operating losses that were fully reserved in prior periods 
had that reversal not occurred  we would have recorded an income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes for the year ended june  noncontrolling interest 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended june  was million  reflecting losses attributable to shareholders in our joint venture in the middle east 
there was no minority interest for the year ended june  quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth domestic enrollment data of virtual public schools or hybrid schools for the eight most recent quarters  as well as the percentage of total enrollments in various categories including managed enrollments or enrollments in schools where we provide turn key management services  non managed enrollments or enrollments in programs that use our curriculum and limited other services

while school administrative offices are generally open year round  a school typically serves students during a month academic year 
a school s academic year typically begins in august or september  our first fiscal quarter  and finishes in may or june  our fourth fiscal quarter 
consequently  our first and fourth fiscal quarters reflect fewer than three months of full virtual public school operations when compared to the second and third fiscal quarters 
in the first fiscal quarter  we ship materials to students for the beginning of the school year 
new students will enroll after the start of the school year  but in significantly smaller numbers 
this generally results in higher materials revenues and margin in the first quarter versus other quarters 
in the first and fourth fiscal quarters  online curriculum and computer revenues are generally lower as these revenues are primarily earned during the school academic year which may provide for only one or two months of these revenues in these quarters versus the second and third fiscal quarters 
management and technology service revenues are recognized ratably over the course of our fiscal year 
the combined effect of these factors results in higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter than in the subsequent quarters 
operating expenses are also seasonal 
instructional costs and services expenses increase in the first fiscal quarter primarily due to the costs incurred to ship student materials at the beginning of the school year 
instructional costs may increase significantly quarter to quarter as school operating expenses increase 
for example  enrollment growth will require additional teaching staff  thereby increasing salary and benefits expense 
school events may be seasonal  eg professional development  proctored exam related expenses  and community events  impacting the quarterly change in instructional costs 
the majority of our recruiting and enrollment expenses are incurred in the first and fourth fiscal quarters  as our primary enrollment season is july through september 
a significant portion of our overhead expenses does not vary with the school year or enrollment season 
discussion of seasonality of financial condition certain accounts in our balance sheet are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
as our enrollments and revenues grow  we expect these seasonal trends to be amplified 
the bulk of our materials are shipped to students prior to the beginning of the school year  usually in july or august 
in order to prepare for the upcoming school year  we generally build up inventories during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
therefore  inventories tend to be at the highest levels at the end of our fiscal year 
in the first quarter of our fiscal year  inventories tend to decline significantly as materials are shipped to students 
in our fourth quarter  inventory purchases and the extent to which we utilize early payment discounts will impact the level of accounts payable 
accounts receivable balances tend to be at the highest levels in the first quarter of our fiscal year as we begin billing for all enrolled students and our billing arrangements include upfront fees for many of the elements of our offering 
these upfront fees result in seasonal fluctuations to our deferred revenue balances 
generally  deferred revenue balances related to the schools tend to be highest in the first quarter  when the majority of students enroll 
since the deferred revenue is amortized over the course of the school year  which ends in june  the balance is typically at its lowest at the end of our fiscal year 
generally  deferred revenues from virtual public schools have not been a source of liquidity as most schools receive their funding over the course of the year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded deferred revenues for early materials shipments for the upcoming school year and we also received an early payment for the upcoming school year however that is not typical 
the deferred revenue related to our direct to consumer business results from advance payments for twelve month subscriptions to our online school 
these advance payments are amortized over the life of the subscription and tend to be highest at the end of the fourth quarter and first quarter  when the majority of subscriptions are sold 
also at the end of the fourth quarter  we will record deferred revenues for the middlebury summer language program as students typically prepay for attending the programs that conclude in july 
liquidity and capital resources we financed our capital expenditures including capitalized curriculum development costs  purchases of property and equipment  capitalized software development costs  and purchases of student computers  during the year ended june  primarily through cash flow from operations and capital lease financing 
as of june   and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million  respectively 
as of june   our cash balance included million associated with our joint ventures 
we have a million revolving credit agreement with pnc bank credit agreement that expires in december pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  the proceeds of the term loan facility are to be used for general corporate purposes 
because of the seasonality of our business and timing of funds received  the school expenditures are higher in relation to funds received in certain periods during the year 
the credit agreement provides the ability to fund these periods until cash is received from the schools 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based upon the term of the borrowings 
interest is charged  at our option  either at i the higher of a the rate of interest announced by pnc bank from time to time as its prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus  or ii the applicable london interbank offered rate libor divided by a number equal to minus the maximum aggregate reserve requirement which is imposed on member banks of the federal reserve system against eurocurrency liabilities plus the applicable margin for such loans  which ranges between and  based on the leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit agreement 
the line of credit includes a million letter of credit facility 
issuances of letters of credit reduce the availability of permitted borrowings under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement contains a number of financial and other covenants that  among other things  restrict our and our subsidiaries abilities to incur additional indebtedness  grant liens or other security interests  make certain investments  become liable for contingent liabilities  make specified restricted payments including dividends  dispose of assets or stock  including the stock of its subsidiaries  or make capital expenditures above specified limits and engage in other matters customarily restricted in senior secured credit facilities 
we must also maintain a maximum debt leverage ratio 
these covenants are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions 
through june   we were in compliance with these covenants 
as of june   no borrowings were outstanding on the line of credit and approximately million was reserved for a letter of credit 
in august  we entered into an million equipment lease line of credit for new purchases with pnc equipment finance  llc that expires on march  the interest rate on new borrowings is set at the time of borrowing based upon interest rates in the federal reserve statistical release h 
for the year ended june   we borrowed million to finance the purchase of student computers and other equipment at an interest rate of approximately 
these leases include a month payment term with a bargain purchase option at the end of the term 
accordingly  we include this equipment in property and equipment and the related liability in capital lease obligations 
in addition  we have pledged the assets financed with the equipment lease line to secure the amounts outstanding 
a substantial portion of our revenues are generated through our contractual arrangements with virtual public schools 
the virtual public schools are generally funded on a per student basis by their state and local governments and the timing of funding varies by state 
due to the recession  many states have reduced per enrollment funding for public education affecting many of the virtual public schools we serve 
while the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra has provided additional funds to states  it has not fully offset the state funding reductions 
thus  the net impact to funding was negative in many states and had a negative effect on our revenue and income for our fiscal years and our financial results reflect annual school revenues and expenses  including arra funds  state funding reductions and expense reductions that we undertook in order to mitigate the impact of the funding reductions that have occurred 
at this time  many states still have budget issues and the specific level of federal funding for the coming years is not yet known so it is possible we could experience lower per enrollment funding in the future 
funding receipts by an individual school may vary over the year and may be in arrears 
on rare occasions  we have experienced delayed payments 
because our receivables represent obligations indirectly due from governments  we have not historically had an issue with non payment and believe the risk of non payment is minimal although we cannot guarantee this will continue 
our cash requirements consist primarily of day to day operating expenses  capital expenditures and contractual obligations with respect to facility leases  capital equipment leases and other operating leases 
we expect capital expenditures to increase for the next year including expenditures for additional courses  new releases of existing courses  foreign language courses developed in our mil joint venture  and internal systems enhancements to support our growth and the integration of kcdl 
we also expect expenditures for computers to support virtual school enrollments to increase with enrollment growth 
we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures with cash on hand  cash generated from operations  capital lease financing or advances under our line of credit 
we lease all of our office facilities 
we expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations 
we believe that the combination of funds currently available and funds to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we continue to explore acquisitions  strategic investments  and joint ventures related to our business that we may acquire using cash  stock  debt  contribution of assets or a combination thereof 
redemption right of middlebury college in the formation of our joint venture with middlebury college middlebury  at any time after the fifth th anniversary of the agreement  middlebury may give written notice of its irrevocable election to sell all but not less than all of its membership interest to us put right 
given the put right is redeemable outside of our control it is recorded outside of permanent equity at its estimated redemption value 
the purchase price for middlebury s membership interest shall be its fair market value and we may  in our sole discretion  pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock 
we will record the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest on each balance sheet date in accordance with eitf topic d and any changes to the redemption value should be recognized as adjustments to retained earnings  or in the absence of retained earnings  by adjustment to additional paid in capital 
as of june   the redeemable noncontrolling interest was million 
the agreement also includes a provision whereby  if certain milestones are not met related to expanding the business by june  middlebury will have the option to repurchase certain contributed assets at their fair market value 
redemption right of series a special stock in july  we acquired all of the stock of kc distance learning  inc kcdl  a provider of online curriculum and public and private virtual education  by issuing to its parent company kcdl holdings llc  million shares of a new class of stock designated as series a special stock  which had a value at closing of million 
this transaction occurred after our fiscal year ended and therefore is not reflected on our balance sheet as of june  kcdl holdings  inc is an affiliate of the learning group  llc  a related party 
our board of directors obtained an opinion from an independent financial advisor that the consideration paid in the acquisition was fair from a financial point of view to k and its stockholders 
the holders of the series a shares initially have no voting rights and no rights of conversion with respect to the series a shares  however  we have agreed to convene a meeting of our stockholders to obtain their approval to permit the conversion of the series a shares into common stock on a one for one basis and for the right to vote on all matters presented to k shareholders  other than for the election and removal of directors  for which holders of the series a shares shall have no voting rights 
in the event that the k stockholders do not approve the voting rights and rights of conversion of the series a shares by the first anniversary of the closing of the acquisition  the series a shares will be redeemable at the option of the holder or k at a price per share of the greater of or the price per share of the k common stock at the date of redemption 
learning group llc and certain of its affiliates have agreed to vote their shares of k common stock representing approximately of our common stock in favor of the rights of conversion and voting rights of series a shares pursuant to a voting agreement 
the aggregate redemption liability if fully exercised will not be less than million of cash 
given the voting agreement entered into with the learning group llc and the nyse voting requirements  we believe it is likely that the shareholder vote will be successful 
however  if the vote to permit conversion is not approved  we may have to redeem the series a shares with cash 
based upon our current cash balances and operating and capital expenditures forecasts  we believe the combination of funds currently available  funds to be generated from operations  and access to financing will be adequate to finance the redemption should it occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at june  and june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively 
future interest and investment income is subject to the impact of interest rate changes and we may be subject to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
at june   a gross increase in interest rates earned on cash would result in million annualized increase in interest income 
our short term debt obligations under our revolving credit facility are subject to interest rate exposure  however as we had no outstanding balance on this facility as of june   fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest expense 
foreign currency exchange risk we currently operate in a foreign country  but we do not transact a material amount of business in a foreign currency and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  we are pursuing opportunities in international markets 
if we enter into any material transactions in a foreign currency or establish or acquire any subsidiaries that measure and record their financial condition and results of operation in a foreign currency  we will be exposed to currency transaction risk and or currency translation risk 
exchange rates between us dollars and many foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and may continue to do so in the future 
accordingly  we may decide in the future to undertake hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our financial condition and results of operations
