item selected financial data not required for smaller reporting companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties 
at january   the innsuites system included five moderate and full service hotels with hotel suites 
four of our hotels are branded through franchise agreements with best western 
all five hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants and meeting banquet room rentals 
our operations consist of one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  we receive management fees  trademark license fees and reservation fees from four hotels owned by mr 
wirth and his affiliates and trademark license fees from one hotel owned by a non related third party 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing  which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
supply of hotels has increased in the markets we operate  particularly in the yuma  arizona and ontario  california markets 
market demand has declined in the tucson  arizona market 
either a further increase in supply or a further decline in demand could result in increased competition  which could have an adverse effect on the revenue of the hotels in their respective markets 
declining economic conditions  both generally and specifically in the travel industry  had a negative impact on our operations beginning late in fiscal year and through fiscal year we do not anticipate significant improvement in these conditions during fiscal year we expect difficult overall economic conditions to result in continued reduced business and leisure travel and room rates  and therefore lower operating margins 
we expect the major challenge for fiscal year to be the continuation of strong competition for group and other business in the markets in which we operate  which may affect our ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we believe that we have positioned the hotels to remain competitive through selective refurbishment and by carrying a relatively large number of two room suites at each location 
hotel properties held for sale we reclassified all of our hotel properties from held for sale to held and used in the third quarter ended october  due to the economic conditions and credit market restraints at that time  the funds were not available to potential buyers to finance a purchase of one or more of our hotels 
as a result of this reclassification  we recorded million in depreciation expense during the third quarter of fiscal year that was previously suspended while the assets were held for sale 
we continue to seek qualified buyers for our hotels and or our hotel system and will continue to migrate our primary business from a hotel owner to a hospitality service company providing trademark licensing and management services 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project hotel cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under guidance codified in asc topic related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available  or the present value of future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
at january  and  we owned a and  respectively  interest in four of the hotels through our sole general partner s interest in the partnership and owned a interest in one hotel 
we purchased  and  partnership units during the years ended january  and  respectively 
our expenses consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels and hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist primarily of payroll  guest and maintenance supplies  marketing and utilities expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse us for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  which is calculated as rooms sold divided by total rooms available  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room reven ue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the hotels 
in fiscal year  occupancy decreased to from in the prior year 
adr decreased by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  which resulted in a decrease in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decreased occupancy and rates reflect the softened economy and travel industry during fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not increase or decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions 
we enter into transactions with certain related parties from time to time 
for information relating to such related party transactions see the following for a discussion of management and licensing agreements with certain related parties  see item business management and licensing contracts

results of operations of the trust for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  overview a summary of operating results for the fiscal years ended january  and is change change revenue operating income loss net loss loss per share basic loss per share diluted our overall results in fiscal year were negatively affected by the challenging overall economic environment and the hospitality industry in particular 
for the twelve months ended january   we had total revenue of million compared to million for the twelve months ended january   a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease in total revenue is primarily due to lower occupancies and rates at the hotels  resulting in decreased room revenues 
during fiscal year  we expect reduced occupancy and revenue levels to continue 
total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  reflects a decrease of approximately million compared to total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to recording deferred depreciation on assets previously classified as held for sale of million in the third quarter of fiscal year  but recording no su ch depreciation expense in fiscal year  and reduced operating expenses as a result of lower business levels 
general and administrative expenses include overhead charges for management  accounting  shareholder and legal services 
general and administrative expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  represented a decrease of  or  from the prior year total of million 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower overhead costs  specifically payroll and professional expenses  and lower hotel level costs as a result of lower business levels 
total operating expenses for the twelve months ended january  were million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from million in the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to recording deferred depreciation on assets held for sale of million in the third quarter of fiscal year  but recording no such depreciation expense in fiscal year  and reduced operating expenses as a result of lower business levels 
total interest expense for the twelve months ended january  was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of  or  due primarily to higher mortgage debt levels after the refinance of the yuma property at the end of fiscal year interest on mortgage notes payable for the twelve months ended january  was million  an increase of  or  from million in the twelve months ended january  the increase is primarily due to higher mortgage debt levels after the refinance of the yuma property at the end of fiscal year interest on notes payable to banks decreased  or  to  from  during the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to less borrowings on our lines of credit as a result of th e liquidity provided by the yuma and albuquerque mortgage refinancings 
hotel property depreciation for the twelve months ended january  was million  a decrease of approximately  from million in the twelve months ended january  the decrease was due to the recording of million of deferred depreciation on assets previously classified as held for sale when they were reclassified to held and used in the third quarter of fiscal we had a consolidated net loss before income taxes of million for the twelve months ended january   compared to million in the prior year 
after deducting the loss allocated to the minority interest of  and adding the income tax benefit of  we had a net loss attributable to controlling interests of approximately million for fiscal year  which represented approximately  in additional net loss attributable to controlling interests as compared to the twelve months ended january  basic and diluted net loss per share was for the twelve months ended january   compared to for fiscal year the change from the prior year is primarily attributable to reduced business levels at the hotel properties 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is our share of the partnership s cash flow and its direct ownership of the yuma  arizona property 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is hotel operations for the four hotel properties it owns 
our liquidity  including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders  will depend upon our ability and the partnership s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
hotel operations are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  both of which decreased from fiscal year to  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing  which reduces our profit margins on rented suites 
in past years  we have relied on our cash flows from operations to meet our financial obligations as they come due 
for the remainder of fiscal year april  through january   our management has projected that cash flows from operations alone may not be sufficient to meet all of our financial obligations as they become due during fiscal year based on this projection  we began the process of refinancing our yuma hotel property  bringing in enough cash for management to believe that we will now meet all of our financial obligations as they become due during fiscal the new loan  for an additional million on yuma  closed in mid april  resulting in net proceeds to us of  with the proceeds from the new loan on yuma  management believes that it will have enough cash on hand to meet all of our financial obligations as they become due 
in the event that our cash on hand is insufficient to meet all of our obligations during fiscal  we have an established  line of credit with sonoran bank that is available if additional funds are needed 
in addition  due to the economy  our management has analyzed other strategic options available to us  including the refinancing of another property or raising additional funds through equity financing 
we anticipate a possible continuation of the weak overall economic situation that negatively affected results in fiscal year  which could result in continued increased competition for business and leisure travel 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for all types of business in the markets in which we operate and our ability to maintain room rates while maintaining market share 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to reduced business levels and rates at the hotel properties  reflecting the slow economy and its impact on the travel industry 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was due to decreased spending on capital improvements 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended january  and net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended january  the decreases year to year were primarily due to the mortgage refinance of the yuma hotel property during fiscal year as of january   we had no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements that is set aside annually  as described below 
we continue to contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund an amount equal to of the innsuites hotels revenues from operation of the hotels 
the fund is restricted by the mortgage lender for four of our properties 
as of january    was held in these accounts and is reported on our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately  and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
we consider the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated usef ul lives 
depreciation was suspended on the hotel s capitalized assets between august  until august  while the hotels were classified as held for sale 
we plan to spend approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year the hotels also spent approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
we have minimum debt payments of  and million due during fiscal years and  respectively 
on march   we established an  revolving line of credit to replace the  line of credit that matured on may  the new line of credit matured in july  at which time the trust extended the term 
the line of credit has no financial covenants  bears interest at wall street journal prime and has an interest floor of which was the effective rate as of january  and matures on june  as of january   we had drawn  of the funds available under the line of credit 
we plan to renew our bank line of credit when it matures during fiscal year to provide additional liquidity during fiscal year and for fiscal year  the trust refinanced its mortgage note payable on the albuquerque property in october  resulting in net proceeds of  as of january   we had mortgage notes payable of million outstanding with respect to the hotels   in secured promissory notes outstanding to unrelated third parties arising from the share of beneficial interest and partnership unit repurchases  and no principal due and payable under notes and advances payable to mr 
wirth and his affiliates 
management believes that cash on hand  available funds on its bank line of credit and future cash receipts from operations in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
we may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as we consider prudent 
future positioning in viewing the hotel industry cycles  the board of trustees determined that may have been the high point of the current hotel industry cycle and further determined it was appropriate at that time to classify the five hotels owned by the trust as held for sale 
we began actively seeking buyers for our properties 
we engaged the services of several hotel brokers and began independently advertising our hotels for sale 
on august   the trust reclassified its hotel properties from held for sale to held and used 
after one year of efforts  we failed to find any qualified buyers for our hotel properties 
as a result of this reclassification  we recorded million in depreciation expense that was previously suspended during the period in which the assets were classified as held for sale 
we continue to independent ly advertise our hotels for sale 
our long term strategic plan is to obtain the full benefit of our real estate equity and to migrate our focus from a hotel owner to a hospitality service company by expanding our trademark license  management  reservation  and advertising services 
this plan is similar to strategies followed by international diversified hotel industry leaders  which over the last several years have reduced real estate holdings and concentrated on hospitality services 
we began our long term corporate strategy when we relinquished our reit income tax status in january  which had previously prevented us from providing management services to hotels 
in june  we acquired our trademark license and management agreements and began providing management  trademark and reservations services to our hotels 
in july  the board of trustees voted to list and or present for sale all five of our hotel pro perties 
the table below lists the hotel properties  their respective carrying and mortgage value and the estimated sales value for the hotel properties 
hotel property asset values as of january  hotel property book value mortgage balance listed terms sales price albuquerque ontario tucson oracle tucson city center yuma totals there is no assurance that the listed sales price for the individual hotel properties will be realized  however our management believes that these sales prices are reasonable based on local market conditions and comparable sales 
changes in market conditions have in part and may in the future result in our changing one or all of the sales prices 
we provide trademark licensing  management  reservation and advertising services to all the hotel properties listed above and expect to continue the trademark licensing services  which includes the reservation and advertising services  and or continue the management services  which also includes the reservation and advertising services  after the hotels are sold 
if any or all of these hotel properties are sold  our future management and or licensing fees could be reduced if the purchaser did not continue to retain innsuites hotels to provide those services 
in the past  when we have sold hotel properties to unrelated third parties  we have continued to provide management and or trademark licensing and reservation services after a sale  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so in the future 
as part of the board study for  greater emphasis has been placed on priority for additional management  trademark and reservations fee income 
we have determined that it is easier to sell management contracts when the trademark services are also provided 
as part of the emphasis on trademark services  we have developed two trademark packages 
the first is the traditional innsuites hotels suites regional package and the second is the innsuites boutique hotel collection  which now includes four affiliate hotels managed by us 
sales and marketing are being handled internally 
share repurchase program on january   the board of trustees approved a share repurchase program under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  for the purchase of up to  limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
on september   august  and september   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
additionally  on january   september  and january   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to   and  respectively  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or share s of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
acquired shares of beneficial interest will be held in treasury and will be available for future acquisitions and financings and or for awards granted under the innsuites hospitality trust stock incentive and option plan 
during fiscal year  we acquired  shares of beneficial interest in open market transactions at an average price of per share and  shares of beneficial interest in privately negotiated transactions at an average price of per share 
also  we acquired  rrf limited partnership units at an average price of per unit 
we intend to continue repurchasing shares of beneficial interest and rrf limited partnership units in compliance with applicable legal and nyse amex requirements 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business and employment contracts for key employees  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
see accounting matters below for a discussion of new accounting interpretations with respect to variable interest entities and the impact of such interpretations on us 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the policies we follow for the valuation of our hotel properties  which constitute the majority of our assets  are our most critical policies 
fasb has issued authoritative guidance related to the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  codified in asc topic  which we apply to determine when it is necessary to test an asset for recoverability 
on an events and circumstances basis  we review the carrying value of our hotel properties 
we will record an impairment loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and the current market value of the property do not support its carrying value 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for use  we will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel  as determined by a current appraisal or other acceptable valuation methods 
in cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for sale  we will reduce the carrying value to the sales price less costs to sell 
we did not recognize impairment loss in fiscal years or as of january   our management does not believe that the carrying values of any of its hotel properties are impaired 
accounting matters in june  fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
all existing accounting standard documents are superseded by the codification and accounting literature not included in the codification will not be authoritative 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec issued under the authority of federal securities laws will continue to be sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification is topically based with topics organized by asc number and updated with accounting standards updates asus 
the codifi cation is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
codified in asc topic on august   which did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued guidance  codified in asc topic  on subsequent events that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it provides guidance on the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
we adopted this guidance during the second quarter of  and its application had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance  codified in asc topic  on accounting and reporting of non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this guidance requires the noncontrolling interest to be separately presented as a component of shareholders equity 
effective february   we adopted this guidance and it was applied retroactively to fiscal year inflation we rely entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general and innsuites hotels in particular can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates as fast or faster than inflation
