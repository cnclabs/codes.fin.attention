you should read the following discussion of our financial condition in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included herein item 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of these risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please see risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of wireless and wireline communications services to consumers and businesses primarily in virginia and west virginia 
our primary services are wireless digital personal communications services pcs  local and long distance telephone services  high capacity transport  data services for internet access and wide area networking and iptv based video services 
our wireless operations are composed of an ntelos branded retail business  including the frawg brand in certain markets  and a wholesale business which primarily relates to an exclusive contract with sprint 
we believe our regional focus and contiguous service area provide us with a differentiated competitive position relative to our primary wireless competitors  most of whom are national providers 
our wireless revenues accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our wireless retail business had approximately  ntelos retail subscribers  representing a penetration of our total covered population 
in  we commenced an upgrade of our wireless network to evolution data optimized revision a ev do 
as of december    or of our total cell sites have been upgraded to ev do  and this has completed the number of sites planned for ev do upgrade at this point 
we amended our agreement with sprint spectrum lp during to act as their exclusive wholesale provider of network services through july  under this arrangement  which we refer to as the strategic network alliance  we are the exclusive pcs service provider in our western virginia and west virginia service area for all sprint cdma wireless customers 
for the years ended december   and  we realized wireless wholesale revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
of this total for the years ended december   and  million  million and million  respectively  related to the strategic network alliance 
following a contractual travel data rate reset on july   our monthly calculated revenue from sprint nextel was below the million minimum and thus we billed and recognized revenue at the million minimum stipulated in the contract 
revenue from this contract is projected to remain at that level throughout our wireline operations include the rural local exchange carrier rlec segment and the competitive wireline segment 
our wireline operating income margins were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
founded in  our wireline incumbent local exchange carrier business is conducted through two subsidiaries that qualify as rlecs under the telecommunications act 
these two rlecs provide wireline communications services to residential and business customers in the western virginia cities of waynesboro and covington  and portions of alleghany  augusta and botetourt counties 
as of december   we operated approximately  rlec telephone access lines 
our wireline business is supported by an extensive  route mile fiber optic network 
we utilize the network to backhaul communications traffic for retail services and to serve as a carriers carrier network  providing transport services to third parties for long distance  internet  wireless and private network services 
our fiber optic network is connected to and marketed with adjacent fiber optic networks in the mid atlantic region 
on december   we closed on an agreement to purchase certain fiber optic and network assets and related transport and data service contracts from allegheny energy  inc the purchase included approximately  route miles of fiber located primarily in central and western pennsylvania and west virginia  with portions also in maryland  kentucky and ohio 
the purchase price for the transaction assets was approximately million 
also in  we purchased an indefeasible right of use iru for million and we completed a fiber swap agreement  which together allowed us to expand our broadband and high capacity business communications services to culpeper  madison and warrenton  virginia  adding approximately fiber route miles to our network 
we leverage our wireline network infrastructure to offer competitive voice and data communication services in virginia and west virginia outside our rlec coverage area through our competitive wireline segment 
within our 
table of contents competitive wireline segment  we market and sell local and long distance  voice and data services almost exclusively to business customers through our competitive local exchange carrier clec and internet service provider isp operation 
as of december   we served customers with approximately  clec access line connections 
we also offer broadband services in over of our rlec service area and as of december   we operated approximately  broadband access connections in our markets  representing an increase of over the connections on december  commencing in late  we have been introducing ntelos video in selected neighborhoods within our two rlec service areas and in two clec neighborhoods 
the product offers video entertainment services and provides an alternative to cable and satellite tv 
it is delivered via fiber to the home ftth which allows us to deliver integrated video  local and long distance telephone services  plus broadband internet access at speeds currently up to megabits per second 
at december   we had approximately  video customers and passed approximately  homes with fiber 
revenues and operating expenses from the broadband and video products are included in the competitive wireline segment 
many of the market risk factors which affected our results of operations in affected our results of operations in additionally  the impact of overall unfavorable economic conditions and increased competition that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of and which we experienced throughout is expected to continue into the magnitude of the impact from the economy and competition may be greater than we anticipate 
if it is  the indefinite lived asset recoverability testing required as of october  or earlier testing performed if such an impairment indicator arises could trigger a revaluation which could result in impairment charges 
in wireless  we made significant network improvements  including our upgrade to ev do  network expansion and cell site additions 
additionally  we continued to improve our handset offerings and refined plans and features to improve the customer experience 
however  the current economic climate and increased competition contributed to slower than anticipated year over year wireless net subscriber growth less than as a result of an increase in customer churn in the second half of and in these higher churn levels resulted in net subscriber losses in the second and third quarters of and almost completely offset gross subscriber additions in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a net subscriber gain of approximately in the fourth quarter of elevated churn levels are expected to continue into although the company will try to mitigate this by investing in further customer retention programs 
we also continue to face risks to our competitive value position in the postpay market  including through the introduction in january of reduced price nationwide unlimited voice plans by competitors such as at t  verizon and us cellular 
we expect postpay competition to continue to be intense as the market gets closer to saturation and carriers focus on taking market share from competitors 
we expect competition with prepaid products to intensify as more competitors have targeted this segment as a means to sustain growth and increase market share 
competition in the wireless prepay market changed dramatically in whereas our prepay competitive position was largely uncontested prior to last year  during a number of large wireless competitors  including boost  tracfone  straight talk  virgin mobile  t mobile and page plus  entered the prepaid market 
many of these competitors have access to big box retailers and convenience stores that are unavailable to us 
pricing competition in the prepaid market also intensified during the fourth quarter of  with the introduction of a number of prepaid unlimited nationwide plans for less than per month 
to remain competitive with our prepaid product offerings  we launched the frawg unlimited wireless brand in the richmond and hampton roads  virginia markets late in the second quarter of frawg provides value seeking customers prepay wireless plan options without a contract  credit check or activation fee 
while plans feature competitive price points  our acquisition costs are substantially lower with reduced handset subsidy and selling costs 
average monthly revenues per handset unit in service arpu from voice are expected to continue to decline due to competitive pressures and economic conditions 
however  we anticipate data arpu will continue to grow and offset a substantial portion of the decline in voice arpu 
our wireless network upgrade to ev do has helped increase retail data arpu by for the year ended december  over the year ended december  higher handset subsidy costs as compared to have been experienced in and are expected to continue into due to actual and expected higher mix of smart phones associated with the projected growth in data arpu 
during smart phone and data card sales represented of postpay sales  up from in data arpu and data revenue are expected to continue to grow in due to the continued increase in penetration and usage escalating from our ev do deployment  however  this upgrade has resulted in a significant increase in network expenses and data cost of sales  both of which are captured in cost of sales and services 
capital expenditures associated with the ev do upgrade decreased in from as a large portion of that upgrade was completed in and the remainder of the planned network upgrade was completed in 
table of contents during  we expanded our network footprint by launching our wireless service in additional new markets  including expansion to provide in town coverage in markets which we had previously only provided coverage along key highway routes 
additionally  we have continued to expand and enhance our network coverage and capacity in many of our primary markets  allowing us to offer our customers an improved service area 
we have incurred significant initial costs associated with these expansion and improvement activities and we plan to continue to enhance our network as necessary to continue to provide a high quality network experience and minimize in market roaming costs 
we believe that the investments that we have made and continue to make will provide future benefits by enabling us to continue to add new subscribers  retain existing subscribers and generate additional revenues 
during  we plan to expand into one additional new local market and plan to increase and improve our points of distribution in our existing markets 
as described above  although our net subscriber growth has slowed significantly and was negative in the second and third quarters of  subscribers increased on an annual basis 
also  as our business continues to mature  we expect to increase our cash flows from operations net of capital expenditures 
in the rlec segment  we experienced access line losses in and these losses are expected to continue in  impacted by continued cable competition  wireless substitution and the economic climate 
these line losses  coupled with mid year rate reductions as a result of our biennial tariff filing with the fcc for ntelos telephone  contributed to a decline in rlec revenues from our primary strategy to respond to this trend is to leverage our strong incumbent market position to increase our revenue by cross selling additional services to our customer base  and to promote our competitive wireline segment strategic products local services  iptv based video services  broadband voice and data services  and high capacity network access and transport services and extend our competitive wireline segment network to increase the addressable market area 
toward this pursuit  we added more than new potential markets by adding approximately  fiber route miles to our network  mostly in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents other overview discussion to supplement our financial statements presented under generally accepted accounting principles gaap throughout this document we reference non gaap measures  such as arpu to measure operating performance for which our operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance 
arpu is a telecommunications industry metric that measures service revenues per period divided by the weighted average number of handsets in service during that period 
arpu as defined below may not be similar to arpu measures of other companies  is not a measurement under gaap and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in our consolidated statements of operations 
we closely monitor the effects of new rate plans and service offerings on arpu in order to determine their effectiveness 
we believe arpu provides management useful information concerning the appeal of our rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value customers 
the table below provides a reconciliation of operating revenue from our wireless segment note in our notes to consolidated financial statements to subscriber revenues used to calculate average monthly arpu for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands  other than average monthly arpu data wireless communications revenues less equipment revenues from sales to new customers less equipment revenues from sales to existing customers less wholesale revenues less plus other revenues and adjustments wireless gross subscriber revenues average number of subscribers total average monthly arpu proforma total average monthly arpu wireless gross subscriber revenues less wireless voice and other features revenues wireless data revenues average number of subscribers total data average monthly arpu we entered into a new agreement with more favorable terms to provide handset insurance to wireless subscribers  effective april  due to the differences in the terms of this new arrangement  revenues for handset insurance are no longer reported on a gross basis  but on a net basis instead 
this has led to a reduction in total arpu from the comparative twelve month periods in and historical periods will not be restated 
the proforma amounts indicated above are calculated on a net basis effective january  in september of  we launched a new prepay billing platform which enhanced product offerings to customers and allowed us to separately identify certain data revenues previously bundled into blended arpu  and certain of the underlying plans were modified to offer data services 
accordingly  beginning in the fourth quarter of  this revenue is included in data revenue 
additionally  beginning in the first quarter of  an allocation of certain postpay bundled package revenues representing the portion relating to data was reclassified into data revenue 
these items contributed to accelerate growth in data arpu over 
table of contents operating revenues our revenues are generated from the following categories wireless pcs  consisting of retail revenues from network access  data services  equipment revenues and feature services  and wholesale revenues from the strategic network alliance and roaming from other carriers  rlec segment revenues  including local service  network access  toll and directory advertising  competitive wireline segment revenues  including revenues from our key strategic products local services  broadband voice and data services  high capacity network access and transport services and iptv based video services and from other competitive revenues long distance  dial up internet services  switched access and reciprocal compensation  and other communications services revenues  including primarily revenues from paging and revenue from leasing excess building space 
operating expenses our operating expenses are incurred from the following categories cost of sales and services  including digital pcs handset equipment costs which  in keeping with industry practice  particularly with handsets sold with service contracts  we sell to our customers at a price below our cost  and usage based access charges  including long distance  roaming charges  and other direct costs incurred in accessing other telecommunications providers networks in order to provide telecommunication services to our end user customers  leased facility expenses for connection to other carriers  cell sites and switch locations and engineering and repairs and maintenance expenses related to property  plant and equipment  customer operations expenses  including marketing  product management  product advertising  selling  billing  publication of regional telephone directories  customer care  directory services  customer retention and bad debt expenses  corporate operations expenses  including taxes other than income  executive  accounting  legal  purchasing  information technology  human resources and other general and administrative expenses  including earned bonuses and equity based compensation expense related to stock and option instruments held by certain members of corporate management  and charges related to the and voluntary early retirement plan verp  severance charges related to a workforce reduction and the secondary offering costs  depreciation and amortization  including depreciable long lived property  plant and equipment  amortization of intangible assets where applicable  and accretion of asset retirement obligations aro 
other income expenses our other income expenses are generated incurred from interest expense on debt instruments  including changes in fair value of our interest rate swap instrument  which was terminated during the august refinancing  other income  which includes interest income  and gain on sale of investments 
income taxes our income tax expense and effective tax rate increases or decreases based upon changes in a number of factors  including our pre tax income or loss  state minimum tax assessments  and non deductible expenses 
noncontrolling interests in losses earnings of subsidiaries we have an rlec segment partnership that owns certain signaling equipment and provides service to a number of small rlecs and to verisign that has a noncontrolling interest 
also  our virginia pcs alliance  lc  or the va alliance  that provides pcs services to a million populated area in central and western virginia  has a noncontrolling interest 
the va alliance has incurred cumulative operating losses since it initiated pcs services in prior to the application of the provisions on attributing net income and comprehensive income to the parent and the 
table of contents noncontrolling interest described in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  we attributed net income or losses to the noncontrolling interests in the va alliance only to the extent of capital contributions from the minority owners as this entity had net cumulative losses in excess of their cumulative capital contributions through december  no capital contributions from the minority owners were made during the years ended december   or in accordance with fasb asc which we adopted on january   we are attributing net income or losses to the noncontrolling interests in the va alliance on a prospective basis 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues increased million  or  from to wireless pcs accounted for approximately the increase  with growth occurring primarily from wholesale revenues 
wireline contributed the remaining revenue increase primarily from growth in key strategic product revenues in the competitive wireline segment  partially offset by a decline in revenue from the rlec segment 
operating income increased million over operating margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in operating income and the margin expansion for the year are attributable to the fact that operating expenses decreased from the comparative year  primarily driven by a decrease in accelerated depreciation as discussed further below 
net income attributable to ntelos holdings corp 
increased million  or  over in addition to the million increase in operating income  other expenses net of other income  decreased by million primarily relating to the change in interest rate swap which was favorable by million  from a loss of million in the year ended december  to a gain of million in the year ended december  these increases to net income were primarily offset by a million increase in income tax expense 
operating revenues the following table identifies our external operating revenues by business segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating revenues variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other total wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues increased million from to due to an increase in our net retail subscriber revenue of million  or  a million  or  increase in equipment revenue and an million  or  increase in wholesale and roaming revenues 
subscriber revenues reflected net subscriber growth of approximately  subscribers  or  from approximately  subscribers as of december  to approximately  subscribers as of december  churn with certain prepaid products and a shift to a higher content of prepaid as compared to postpay gross subscriber additions reduced subscriber revenue growth 
data revenue increased million  but was mostly offset by a decline in voice revenues brought about by competitive pricing reductions and economic conditions which contributed to subscribers changing to or purchasing lower priced plans  the mix shift noted above and an increase in the number of prepay subscribers who suspend service for a period of time 
underlying the growth in data revenue was the technology upgrade to ev do deployed to of our cell sites as of december   and an increased sales emphasis on smart phones and other data centric handsets coupled with 
table of contents a broader array of data packages and increased sales of data cards 
total data arpu for all prepay and postpay products was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   an increase of  reflecting the increased take rate on data packages and increased usage rates 
growth in data arpu has partially offset declines in voice arpu  leading to blended arpu of for as compared to for  a decrease 
pro forma of the handset insurance reporting change see footnote to the arpu reconciliation table above  blended arpu decreased 
in response to competitive pressures  we launched the frawg unlimited wireless brand in the richmond and hampton roads  virginia markets late in the second quarter of frawg provides prepay wireless options at lower  competitive price points along with reduced subsidy and sales costs to us 
for the second half of  the launch of frawg contributed to a higher mix of prepay sales at lower arpu levels than the traditionally higher arpu postpay rate plans  albeit at a lower net subsidy cost from the prepay sales 
the launch of frawg  coupled with the current economic environment and competitive pricing  could result in further declines in voice related arpu which we anticipate will be partially offset by growth in data arpu 
the increase in wholesale and roaming revenue was driven by a million  or increase in revenue from the strategic network alliance 
additionally  roaming revenues from other carriers grew million over the comparative year 
the revenue increase from the strategic network alliance is reflective of the significant growth in data usage which was billable at substantially higher contractual preset rates in the prior year and up until the july  contractual travel data rate reset 
following the travel data rate reset  our monthly calculated revenue from sprint nextel was below the million minimum and thus we billed and recognized revenue at the million minimum stipulated in the contract 
revenue from this contract is projected to remain at that level throughout accordingly  due to the first half of wholesale revenues being above the million minimum per month  we would expect a decline of approximately million in if wholesale revenue remains at the million per month minimum as expected 
also  roaming revenues from other carriers may decline in as a result of industry consolidation of carriers with complementary networks or from other roaming arrangements which may not be favorable to us 
our wholesale revenues derived from the strategic network alliance are primarily from the voice usage by sprint and sprint affiliate customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area home minutes of use  those customers of sprint who use our network for voice services while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area travel minutes of use and data usage by sprint customers who live in or travel through the strategic network alliance service area 
we added cell sites within this wholesale service area from december  to december   improving existing service and extending this coverage area 
the strategic network alliance extends through july  and is subject to automatic three year extensions unless certain notice provisions are exercised 
the agreement prohibits sprint from directly or indirectly commencing construction of  contracting for or launching its own wireless communications network in the agreement territory until a maximum of months prior to the end of the agreement 
the agreement specifies a series of usage rates for various types of services 
the voice rate pricing under the agreement was fixed through july   but provides for volume discounts based on sprint s voice revenue yield on that date and thereafter semi annually to provide incentives for the migration of additional traffic onto the network 
data rates for sprint in market home subscribers are on a per subscriber basis 
the data rate for sprint customers that are traveling through the territory and use the network is on a per kilobyte basis 
this rate is reset quarterly 
the strategic network alliance also permits our ntelos branded customers to access sprint s national wireless network at reciprocal rates as the sprint travel rates 
wireline communications revenues wireline communications revenues increased million  or  over the comparative year  with revenues from strategic products increasing million  or  primarily offset by a million  or  decrease in rlec revenues 
rlec revenues 
rlec revenues decreased million from the prior year primarily due to decreased access and local service revenues as a result of a decrease in access lines  partially offset by a increase in carrier access minutes due primarily to growth in usage by wireless carriers 
on july   our interstate access rates were subject to a biennial reset reduction 
this rate reset coupled with network grooming by our customers resulted in an annual reduction in revenue of approximately million 
access lines totaled approximately  as of december  and  as of december  this access line loss is reflective of residential wireless substitution  the effect of current economic conditions on 
table of contents businesses  the introduction of competitive voice service offerings from comcast  which commenced in may in one of our three rlec markets  and the conversion of centrex lines to pbx trunks 
we expect that the competitive voice service competition will primarily be for residential customers 
we expect to encounter additional voice competition in the first quarter of which could result in greater line losses than experienced in and competitive wireline revenues 
competitive wireline revenue for increased million over due to growth in strategic products 
broadband voice and data services include broadband over fiber  dedicated internet access  dsl  integrated access and metro ethernet 
revenues from these services increased million  or 
additionally  revenues from iptv based video services increased million to million driven by growth in customers 
operating expenses the following table identifies our operating expenses by business segment  consistent with the table presenting operating revenues above  for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating expenses variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other operating expenses  before equity based compensation charges  charges from voluntary early retirement and workforce reduction plans  depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations equity based compensation voluntary early retirement and workforce reduction plans depreciation and amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations total operating expenses operating expenses the following describes our operating expenses by segment and on a basis consistent with our financial statement presentation 
the discussion below relates to our operating expenses by segment before equity based compensation charges  charges from our voluntary early retirement and workforce reduction plans  depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations wireless communications the operating expense increase in wireless communications over the comparative year was primarily due to increased costs of maintaining our network  combined with increases in selling and customer care expenses 
specifically  cell site and network access expenses increased million related to additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network  strong growth in data usage by subscribers and our increased subscriber base  and related to a increase in the number of cell sites as of december  over december  bad debt expense increased million over the comparative year due to an increase in involuntary churn 
table of contents particularly with lower credit class customers and the impact of the economy and retention costs increased million over the comparative year due to an increase in the volume and cost of handset swaps and upgrades driven from promotional pricing 
advertising expense increased million related to heavier advertising in response to competitive pressure and to promote the frawg unlimited prepay offering launched in the second quarter of in addition to the above  compensation  benefits and employee sales commissions increased a total of million over the comparative year primarily due to inflationary wage increases  an increase in pension expense as a result of lower pension plan asset values as of december  due to a significant decline in of the fair value of plan assets and an increase in the number of gross additions from the comparative year 
other notable increases were contracted services  bank charges and license fees and royalties  which collectively increased million over prior year 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other general and administrative expenses of million  with a decline in performance based compensation partially offset by normal increases in other expenses 
agent sales commissions also decreased million from the comparative year due to a decrease in sales generated from third party agents and the lower selling costs related to the frawg product 
the increase in wireless communications operating expenses for is partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales cos of million from this decrease in cos was primarily driven by a decrease in roaming costs of million as a result of in network roaming savings associated with continued cell site expansion and lower roaming rates from our roaming partners 
also  handset insurance cos decreased million from prior year related to the april  reporting change discussed in the other overview discussion section above 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in equipment cos of million over the prior year due to an increase in subscriber additions and an increase in handset sales to our handset insurance provider 
revenue from handset sales to new and existing customers has risen in over due to the increase in selection of smart phones and other data centric handsets coupled with more data product offerings and capabilities and attractive handset pricing intended to attract new customers and encourage existing customers to renew their contracts 
this also led to a million increase in data cos 
we expect cos expenses to grow in as our customer base grows  roaming volume from national and unlimited plans increases  sales of smart phones and data cards continue to represent a significantly higher percentage of total sales than in the prior year and usage of data features increases 
this will be partially offset by a higher content of frawg product sales which generally carry lower equipment cos 
with the significant increase in data volume we will see a decrease in data unit rates 
we also anticipate to reduce networking costs in certain areas related to a capital investment that will result in network facility sharing related to ev do voice and data and thus allow us to eliminate duplicate facilities in certain areas 
wireline communications the decrease in wireline operating expenses noted in the table above is primarily attributable to decreases in general and administrative costs from lower performance based compensation expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in access expense  other compensation and benefits and repair and maintenance expenses 
other the increase in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to the recognition in the first quarter of of a million signing bonus paid to our new president and chief operating officer in consideration of compensation foregone by him by departing his previous employer before vesting dates 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services increased million  or  from to cell site and network access costs increased million over primarily related to an increase in the number of cell sites over december  and additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network  increased data usage and our increased subscriber base  as described above 
other notable increases were repairs and maintenance  materials and supplies  and other expenses incurred in the provisioning of service  which increased million collectively 
these increases were primarily offset by a million decrease in performance based compensation expense due to the company not achieving the minimum financial targets to earn a bonus in also included in cost of sales and services are variable cos 
as discussed above  wireless variable cos decreased million from 
table of contents customer operations expenses customer operations expenses increased million  or  from to bad debt expense increased million over  reflecting a worsening of receivables aging and an increase in the amount of accounts written off 
advertising expenses increased million over related to an increase in promotions to combat the increase in competitive pressures and to promote the recently launched frawg unlimited prepay offering 
also  as discussed in the wireless communications section above  retention costs increased million over partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in performance based compensation expense due to the company not achieving the minimum financial targets to earn a bonus under this plan in all other selling and marketing related expenses collectively decreased million from primarily due to a decrease in third party agent commissions 
corporate operations expenses corporate operations expense decreased million  or  from to this decrease includes a decrease of million related to charges in for a voluntary early retirement offered to select employees in the wireline division 
these charges primarily represent an enhanced pension benefit offered to the employees who accepted the early retirement offer 
additionally  performance based compensation expense decreased million from due to the company not achieving the minimum financial targets to earn a bonus under this plan in if the company meets its performance based compensation plan objectives in  we would expect to pay incentive bonuses for fiscal year  thus increasing the expense in partially offsetting these decreases was a charge of million in representing the signing bonus for our new president and chief operating officer who was hired in march discussed in other above 
also included in the results for were charges of million relating to a voluntary early retirement plan and severance related to a workforce reduction and charges of million relating to a bonus for our president and chief operating officer who was promoted to chief executive officer and president in december  and compensation related to a retirement agreement for our former chief executive officer 
the decrease was also partially offset by increases in professional fees  license fees and royalties and contracted services in over depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  from to this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in accelerated depreciation of million from primarily related to g xrtt and other equipment scheduled to be replaced earlier than originally anticipated in connection with the ev do upgrade discussed below  which was complete in the service area covered by the strategic network alliance by december  and fully completed by june  in all areas planned for upgrade at this time of total cell sites 
amortization expense decreased million from due to the scheduled completion of amortization for a customer list intangible asset after the first quarter of offsetting this  normal depreciation increased million over due to the million increase in the average depreciable base  with significant investments in property  plant and equipment during and  as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion of asset retirement obligations is recorded in order to accrete the estimated asset retirement obligation over the life of the related asset up to its future expected settlement cost 
this charge decreased approximately million from other income expenses interest expense on debt instruments decreased million  or  from to due primarily to the precipitous drop in libor rates and a lower debt balance from january to august due to million of debt repayments from september  to august  at which time the debt was refinanced see further discussion in the liquidity and capital resource section that follows 
from august  to december   the senior credit facility was increased by over million and the interest rate increased to from an average rate that was over basis points lower through the date of refinancing 
gain loss on interest rate swap instrument s increased million year over year  from a million loss in to a million gain in in august  ntelos inc terminated the interest rate swap agreement that commenced in september with a termination payment of million  inclusive of million of accrued unpaid interest 
this swap agreement was not designated as an interest rate hedge instrument for accounting purposes and  therefore  the changes in the fair value of the swap agreements until the termination date were recorded currently as gain loss on interest rate swap 

table of contents other income expenses includes million in the related to the write off of deferred fees associated with our prior senior secured credit facility which was paid in full in connection with the refinancing noted above 
the remaining immaterial amounts primarily relate to interest income from cash that declined from the previous periods due to lower investment interest rates and maintaining lower cash balances in interest bearing accounts 
income taxes income tax expense for was million  representing the statutory tax rate applied to pre tax income and the effects of certain non deductible compensation  and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million 
we expect our recurring non deductible expenses to relate primarily to certain non cash share based compensation  and other non deductible compensation 
for  the amounts of these charges for equity based awards outstanding as of december   and other non deductible compensation are expected to be million and million  respectively 
income taxes for were million  driven by non deductible  non cash equity based compensation 
we have unused net operating losses nols totaling million as of december  these nols  along with net unrealized losses existing at the september bankruptcy emergence date  are subject to an annual utilization limitation of million prior to adjustment for realization of built in gains that existed as of the merger  with a maximum limitation of million 
based on this limitation and the adjustments required for certain built in gains realized or to be realized during the five year period immediately following our may  merger  we expect to use nols of approximately million as follows million per year in through  million in and million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues increased million  or  from to wireless pcs accounted for of the increase  with growth occurring from subscriber revenues  wholesale revenues and equipment sales 
wireline contributed the remaining revenue increase primarily from growth in key strategic product revenues in the competitive wireline segment  partially offset by declines in other revenues from the competitive wireline segment and rlec revenues 
operating income increased million over the comparative year  from million for to million for operating margin increased from for to for net income increased million over in addition to the million increase in operating income  interest expense decreased million 
these changes  which served to increase net income  were partially offset by an increase in the loss on the fair value of swap instruments of million and an increase in income tax expense of million 
operating revenues the following table identifies our external operating revenues on a business segment basis for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating revenues variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other total wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues increased million from to due to an increase in our ntelos branded net subscriber revenue of million  or  an million  or  increase in wholesale and roaming revenues and an increase in equipment sales revenues of million  or 

table of contents the increase in subscriber revenues reflects increased postpay revenue of million  or  million of which is from growth in data revenues 
underlying this growth in data revenue was the technology upgrade to ev do deployed to of our cell sites by year end  and an increased sales emphasis on smart phones and other data centric handsets coupled with a richer array of data packages 
the total data arpu for all prepay and postpay products was for compared to for  an increase of 
in addition to this apru growth  the take rates on data packages and usage rates continues to rapidly expand 
growth in data arpu has offset declines in voice rates resulting from economic and competitive pressure  leading to blended arpu of for  below blended arpu of for however  pro forma of the handset insurance reporting change see footnote to the arpu reconciliation table above  blended arpu increased year over year  from in to in in addition to the data arpu growth  total subscribers increased from  at december  to  at december   a  or  net subscriber growth 
the year over year increase in wholesale and roaming revenues was driven by an million  or  increase in revenue from the strategic network alliance 
additionally  roaming revenues from other carriers grew million 
wireline communications revenues wireline communications revenues increased million  or  with revenues from strategic products increasing million  or  and revenues from rlec and other revenues from the competitive wireline segment decreasing million and million  respectively 
rlec revenues 
rlec revenues  which include local service  network access  toll service  directory advertising and calling feature revenues from our rlec customers  decreased primarily due to the decrease in local service revenues and access revenues as a result of a decrease in access lines  which is discussed in further detail below 
access lines totaled approximately  as of december  and  as of december  in addition to the impact from access line loss  the interstate access rate per minute declined more than primarily attributable to a biennial reset of rlec interstate access rates on july   impacting both end user access and tandem switching access 
also  national exchange carrier association neca settlement rates declined  primarily related to the access line loss 
partially offsetting these factors was a increase in carrier access minutes due primarily to growth in usage by wireless carriers 
the access line loss noted above is reflective of residential wireless substitution  second line losses and the introduction of competitive voice service offerings from comcast  which commenced in may in one of our three rlec markets 
competitive wireline revenues 
competitive wireline revenue for increased million over  with the growth in strategic products being offset by the decline in other revenues as noted above 
revenues from broadband voice and data services increased million  or 
additionally  revenues from private line  carrier access and transport services increased million  or 
dial up internet customers continue to decline  resulting in a revenue decline of million  to million for  and switched access  reciprocal compensation and other miscellaneous revenue declined million  to million for on september   the virginia state corporation commission issued a final order in a rulemaking docket that capped clecs intrastate switched access charges  including the access charges of our clecs  at the higher of the clec s interstate switched access charges or the intrastate switched access charges of the ilec or the average of all ilecs providing service in the geographic area served by the clec 
the cap took effect at the end of a transition period that began on december  and ended on march  as part of that transition  we reduced our clec access rates effective on december  and again on april  these lower rates reduced our clec access revenues by a total of million in

the discussion below relates to our operating expenses by segment before equity based compensation charges  voluntary early retirement plan charges  secondary offering costs  depreciation and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations wireless communications of the increase in wireless communications operating expenses noted in the table above  variable cost of sales and services cos accounted for million due primarily to the increase in sales to existing subscribers that upgrade and extend their contract period 
this was more prolific in due to the increase in selection of smart phones and other data centric handsets coupled with more data product offerings and capabilities 
also  we entered into a new handset insurance contract whereby we sold million of equipment to the insurance provider 
increases in roaming and data cos were partially offset by a reduction in handset insurance cos related to the april  reporting change discussed in the other overview discussion section above 
we expect continued growth in cos expenses as our customer base grows  sales of national plans increase  sales of smart phones continue to represent a significantly higher percentage of total sales than in the prior year and usage of data features increases 
the remaining operating expense increase in wireless communications over the comparative period was due to increased costs of maintaining our network  combined with direct and indirect costs of sales and services expenses 
specifically  cell site and network access expenses increased million year over year related to additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network and to support our increased subscriber base  and a increase in the number of cell sites as of december  over december  finally  customer retention and advertising expense increased million year over year and operating taxes and regulatory fees increased a total of million see further discussion below under corporate operations expenses 

table of contents wireline communications the decrease in wireline operating expenses noted in the table above is partially attributable to a million decrease in bad debt expense from primarily due to improved accounts receivable turnover and aging 
also  compensation expenses decreased million  most of which is attributable to savings realized during the second half of related to the voluntary early retirement plan described below  and a million decrease in allocated corporate expenses as a result of an increased percentage of corporate expenses attributable to the significantly faster growing wireless segment 
finally  network access and other network related expenses were flat from prior year due to ongoing network grooming and shifting of traffic to our network versus leased network facilities 
other the increase in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to unallocated accounting and other professional services performed in early associated with the year end professional expenses related to our first year of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and executive recruiting expenses 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services increased million  or  from to as discussed above  wireless variable cost of sales and services increased million year over year and cell site and network access expenses increased million related to cell site expansion and the capacity increase related to the network upgrade to ev do 
the portion of this increase related to the ev do upgrade million results in our adding additional access expenses for every cell site upgraded 
equipment cost of sales increased million in over due to the increase in subscriber additions  the increase in exchanges and sales to existing customers  and the increase in handset sales to our handset insurance provider 
roaming cos increased million year over year primarily to an increased mix of national plans and other plans which contain more roaming minutes  partially offset by in network roaming savings related to continued cell site expansion 
the percentage of subscribers with a national plan increased from as of december  to as of december  data cos increased million in over consistent with increased data usage and revenues 
these and other increases in wireless cost of sales and services were offset by an million decrease in handset insurance cost of sales from primarily related to a change in the reporting of handset insurance from a gross to a net basis effective april  see footnote to the arpu reconciliation table above 
as noted above  wireline network access and other network related expenses were flat due to improved utilization  efficiency and on network traffic 
this is a result of grooming provision configuration enhanced by our commitment over the last three years to invest in our network to move traffic from leased to owned facilities and in improve margins and control service quality 
customer operations expenses customer operations expenses increased million  or  from to wireless retention and advertising expenses increased million related to an increase in promotional pricing needed to combat the increase in competitive and economic pressures experienced in compensation and benefits expenses increased million associated with inflationary growth in wages and an increase in personnel to support subscriber growth 
the remaining increases in over primarily relate to contracted services  rent expense  postage and our phonebook directory 
offsetting these increases were decreases in bad debt expense of million due to improvement in accounts receivable aging and collections forecasts at december  versus the prior year end 
also  wireless selling expenses decreased million due to the decrease in sales through the higher cost third party agent channel 
corporate operations expenses corporate operations expenses increased million  or  from to the results for contain million of charges related to a voluntary early retirement plan offered to a select number of wireline employees 
these charges primarily represent an enhanced pension benefit offered to the employees who accepted the early retirement offer 
regulatory fees increased million and operating taxes increased million 
in  we resolved a tax dispute which resulted in a million operating tax recovery related to a favorable ruling from tax authorities 
additionally  in we resolved other operating tax matters which favorably impacted operating tax expense 
finally  operating taxes increased related to the increase in assets and revenues and other items which are the basis from which these taxes are calculated 
offsetting these increases was a decrease of million relating to legal  accounting and other expenses associated with the secondary stock offering completed in the first quarter of  a million decrease in compensation expense due to a decrease in performance based compensation expense and a million decrease in equity based compensation 
equity based compensation expense decreased as a result of the final vesting of the majority of our former class a shares in the second quarter of 
table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  from to this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in accelerated depreciation of million related to g xrtt and other equipment scheduled to be replaced earlier than originally anticipated related to the ev do upgrade discussed below and a million impairment charge recorded in related to certain c block pcs spectrum 
the spectrum impairment charge reflects the reduction in value of the remaining c block pcs spectrum not in service in two markets to their current estimated net realizable value 
in addition to this  normal depreciation increased million due to the million increase in the average depreciable base  with significant investments in property  plant and equipment during and  as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resource section below 
partially offsetting this was a million decrease in amortization expense from related to the change in the remaining useful life of the intangible asset associated with the strategic network alliance with sprint nextel due to the extension of the contract period end to july as discussed above in the wireless communications revenue section  we have upgraded a majority of our coverage areas with ev do 
during and  we have recorded million and million  respectively  in accelerated depreciation primarily on the g xrtt assets as they have been disposed of or are planned for disposal prior to their previously planned useful lives 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion of asset retirement obligations is recorded in order to accrete the estimated asset retirement obligation over the life of the related asset up to its future expected settlement cost 
this charge increased million in over primarily due to cell site expansion 
other income expenses interest expense on debt instruments decreased million  or  from to due primarily to the precipitous drop in libor rates and a lower debt balance due to million of debt repayment during and million of scheduled debt repayments in loss on interest rate swap instrument s increased million from to in february  ntelos inc entered into a new  month interest rate swap agreement which commenced in september to replace the previous interest rate swap 
these swap agreements were not designated as interest rate hedge instruments for accounting purposes and  therefore  the changes in the fair value of the swap agreements were recorded as gain loss on interest rate swap 
the million loss on interest rate swap recorded in related primarily to the sharp downturn during the fourth quarter in projected libor rates over the remaining life of the swap agreement 
the million loss recorded in was a result of the underlying instruments having a fair value of a million asset at the end of compared to a fair value of a million asset at december  included in the securities and investments section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the current swap agreement had a fair value of a million liability which is included in the long term liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to aid in that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies for discussion herein 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  ntelos inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and those limited liability corporations where ntelos inc or certain of its subsidiaries  as managing member  exercises control 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
revenue recognition policies the company recognizes revenue when services are rendered or when products are delivered  installed and functional  as applicable 
certain services of the company require payment in advance of service performance 
in such cases  the company records a service liability at the time of billing and subsequently recognizes revenue ratably over the service period 
the company bills customers certain transactional taxes on service revenues 
these transactional taxes are not included in reported revenues as they are recognized as liabilities at the time customers are billed 
the company earns revenue by providing access to and usage of its networks in both its wireline and wireless divisions 
local service and airtime revenues are recognized as services are provided 
wholesale revenues are earned by providing switched access and other switched and dedicated services  including wireless roamer management  to other carriers 
revenues for equipment sales are recognized at the point of sale 
pcs handset equipment sold with service contracts are generally sold at prices below cost  based on the terms of the service contracts 
the company recognizes the entire cost of the handsets at the time of sale 
the company evaluates related transactions to determine whether they should be viewed as multiple deliverable arrangements  which impact revenue recognition 
multiple deliverable arrangements are presumed to be bundled transactions and the total consideration is measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair value with certain limitations 
the company has determined that sales of handsets with service contracts related to these sales generated from company owned retail stores are multiple deliverable arrangements 
accordingly  substantially all of the nonrefundable activation fee revenues as well as the associated direct costs are recognized at the time the related wireless handset is sold based on the fact that the handsets are generally sold below cost and on the relative fair value evaluation 
however  revenue and certain associated direct costs for activations sold at third party retail locations are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship as the company is not a principal in the transaction to sell the handset and  therefore  any activation fees charged are fully attributable to the service revenues 
nonrefundable activation fee revenue and certain associated direct costs for transactions in segments other than wireless are deferred as they are not associated with multiple deliverable arrangements but are directly associated with the underlying service being provided over the applicable coverage period 
in all cases  the direct activation costs exceed the related activation revenues 
when deferral is appropriate  the company defers these direct activation costs up to but not in excess of the related deferred revenue 
the company periodically makes claims for recovery of access charges on certain minutes of use terminated by the company on behalf of other carriers 
the company recognizes revenue in the period that it is able to estimate the amount and when the collection of such amount is considered probable 
trade accounts receivable the company sells its services to residential and commercial end users and to other communication carriers primarily in virginia and west virginia 
the company has credit and collection policies to maximize collection of trade receivables and requires deposits on certain sales 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical results  current and expected trends and changes in credit policies 
management believes the allowance adequately covers all anticipated losses with respect to trade receivables 
actual credit losses could differ from such estimates 
the company includes bad debt expense in customer operations expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents inventories and supplies the company s inventories and supplies consist primarily of items held for resale such as pcs handsets and accessories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
market value is determined by reviewing current replacement cost  marketability and obsolescence 
long lived asset recovery long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  radio spectrum licenses  long term deferred charges  goodwill and intangible assets to be held and used 
long lived assets  excluding intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed pursuant to the subsequent measurement guidance described in fasb asc impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment charge 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which the company reviews and updates based on historical experiences and future expectations 
buildings are depreciated over a year life and leasehold improvements  which are categorized in land and buildings  are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining lease terms 
network plant and equipment are depreciated over various lives from to years  with a weighted average life of approximately years 
furniture  fixtures and other equipment are depreciated over various lives from to years 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill  franchise rights and radio spectrum licenses are considered indefinite lived intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired 
the company assesses the recoverability of indefinite lived assets annually on october and whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
pension benefits and retirement benefits other than pensions ntelos inc sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements and were employed by ntelos inc prior to october  the pension plan was closed to ntelos inc employees hired on or after october  pension benefits vest after five years of plan service and are based on years of service and an average of the five highest consecutive years of compensation subject to certain reductions if the employee retires before reaching age and elects to receive the benefit prior to age sections and of the internal revenue code and erisa sections and establish minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans 
the minimum required contribution is generally equal to the target normal cost plus the shortfall amortization installments for the current plan year and each of the six preceding plan years less any calculated credit balance 
if plan assets less calculated credits are equal to or exceed the funding target  the minimum required contribution is the target normal cost reduced by the excess funding  but not below zero 
the company s policy is to make contributions to stay at or above the threshold required in order to prevent benefit restrictions and related additional notice requirements and is intended to provide not only for benefits based on service to date  but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
also  ntelos inc has nonqualified pension plans that are accounted for similar to its pension plan 
ntelos inc provides certain health care and life benefits for retired employees that meet eligibility requirements 
employees hired after april are not eligible for these benefits 
the company s share of the projected costs of benefits that will be paid after retirement is generally being accrued by charges to expense over the eligible employees service periods to the dates they are fully eligible for benefits
