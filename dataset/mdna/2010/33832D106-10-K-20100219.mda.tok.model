item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general industry trends the senior living industry generally is experiencing growth as a result of demographic factors 
according to census data  the population in the united states over age is growing much faster than the general population 
a large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the s 
this development activity caused an excess supply of new  high priced communities 
longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy  price discounting and financial distress for many independent and assisted living operators 
development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of the last decade 
we believe that the nationwide supply and demand for these types of facilities is about balanced today 
we believe that the aging of the united states population and the almost complete reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents private resources should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated 
the increasing availability of assisted living facilities in the s caused occupancy at many snfs to decline 
this fact  together with restrictions on development of new snfs by most states  has generally caused nursing care to be delivered in older facilities 
we believe that many snfs currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that political pressures from an aging population will eventually cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction 
beginning in  problems in certain domestic credit markets presaged a global credit crisis that led to recession in the united states and abroad 
the recession resulted in aggressive government 
table of contents spending in the united states  significant corporate layoffs  reduced availability of credit on reasonable terms in most markets  and lower real estate prices 
this economic weakness has dampened demand for some types of senior living communities in certain markets and our occupancy rates have modestly declined 
also  we have experienced some pricing pressures from competition 
at the same time  we believe our business to be inherently healthy and that the anticipated decline in senior housing construction soon may have an offsetting effect to any decline in demand 
rehabilitation hospitals provide intensive medical services  including physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language services beyond the capability customarily available in snfs 
we believe that our experience in providing high quality rehabilitation services at our irfs has assisted us to provide increasing amounts of rehabilitation services at our senior living communities 
institutional pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy requirements are concentrated 
the business rationale for an institutional pharmacy is to deliver drugs and pharmacy services more efficiently and at lower costs than from expensive retail locations which cater to short term requirements 
the aging of the population and recent pharmacological innovations have created rapidly growing demand for pharmacy drugs and services 
the medicare part d prescription drug benefit was implemented in pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  or mma  and by december  approximately of medicare beneficiaries had enrolled in medicare part d  according to the us department of health and human services 
in  the most recent date for which information is publicly available the government share of all prescription drug expenditures in the united states rose to approximately  including approximately from the medicare program  from medicaid programs and from other public sources 
because the mma has increased medicare expenditures for prescription drugs  we anticipate that the federal government and congress will seek to implement various cost control measures and as a result  the profitability of providing pharmacy goods and services may be reduced 
we earn our senior living revenue primarily by providing housing and services to our senior living residents 
during  approximately of our senior living revenues came from the medicare and medicaid programs and approximately of our senior living revenues came from residents private resources 
we bill all private pay residents in advance for the housing and services to be provided in the following month 
our material expenses are wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our senior living communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other benefits 
other operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs at our senior living communities 
rent expense we lease senior living communities excluding two senior living communities classified as discontinued operations and two rehabilitation hospitals from snh and four senior living communities from hcpi 
hospital expenses includes wages and benefits for our hospital based staff and other operating expenses related to our hospital business 
institutional pharmacy expenses includes the cost of drugs dispensed to our patients as well as wages and benefits for our pharmacies staff and other operating expenses related to our pharmacy business 
general and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities  hospitals and pharmacies 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment that we own  and we incur amortization expense on certain identifiable intangible assets related to our pharmacy acquisitions 
interest and other expenses primarily includes interest on outstanding debt and amortization of deferred financing costs 
our reportable segments consist of our senior living community business and our rehabilitation hospital business 
in the senior living community segment  we operate independent living or congregate care communities  assisted living communities and snfs 
our rehabilitation hospital segment provides inpatient health rehabilitation services at two hospital locations and three satellite locations and outpatient rehabilitation services at outpatient clinics 
we do not consider our institutional pharmacy operations to be a material  separately reportable segment of our business but we report our institutional pharmacy revenues and expense as separate items within our corporate and other activities 
all of our operations and assets are located in the united states  except with regard to our two captive insurance companies  which participate in our workers compensation and liability insurance programs and are located in the cayman islands 
we use segment operating profit as an important measure to evaluate our performance and for business decision making purposes 
segment operating profit excludes interest and other income  interest and other expense and certain corporate expenses

loss from discontinued operations for and was also restated in the current year to reflect the sale of two senior living communities during liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from continuing operations 
at year end  we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
we had no amounts outstanding on our million revolving line of credit and million outstanding under our line of credit with ubs 
we believe that our operations will continue to provide us with adequate cash flow to run our businesses and invest in and maintain our properties 
if  however  our occupancies continue to decline and we are unable to generate positive cash flow for some period of time  we intend to further reduce costs across the company and to borrow additional funds from our outstanding lines of credit 
auction rate securities at december   we had million invested in student loan ars with a par value of million 
we had intended to use the funds which we invested in ars to invest in potential acquisitions 
accordingly  these funds are not needed to fund our current operations 
based upon our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash  we do not expect the failure of auctions affecting our ars holdings to have a material adverse impact upon our day to day operations or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 
in november  we entered into a settlement with ubs regarding our ars 
the settlement was made in connection with ubs s settlement with the sec  the new york attorney general and other state agencies related to ubs s sale and marketing of ars 
under the terms of the settlement  we obtained a right  or the ubs put right  pursuant to which we may require ubs to repurchase our 
table of contents ars at of par value including accrued and unpaid interest  if any at our option during the period beginning june  and ending july  in certain circumstances  ubs has the right to purchase these securities earlier at par 
as part of the settlement terms  we released ubs from all claims arising from its marketing of the ars to us 
in connection with the settlement  ubs provided us with a non recourse credit facility secured by our investments in these ars of up to of the market value of the ars from time to time 
in december  ubs increased the principal amount available to us from to up to of the market value of the ars 
as of december   the estimated fair value of our investment in ars was million and we had borrowings of million outstanding under the credit facility and approximately million remained available to borrow 
our interest rate under the credit facility varies depending on the interest payable to us on the ars  but will not exceed libor plus basis points 
in june  we reclassified our investments in ars  the ubs put right and our outstanding borrowings on our ubs credit facility from the long term to the current sections of our balance sheet because we expect to exercise the ubs put right on june  the value of the ubs put right is the difference between our estimated value of ubs s repurchase obligation and our estimate of the fair value of the ars 
accordingly  the value of the ubs put right may increase or decrease as our estimate of the value of ubs s repurchase obligation and our estimate of the fair value of the ars changes 
we reassess the fair values of both our ars and the ubs put right in each reporting period based on several factors including auction and investment redemption experience  changes in credit ratings of ubs and our ars investments  market risks and other factors 
during the year ended december  we had an unrealized gain of million on our investments in ars and we recognized a corresponding million decrease in the fair value of the ubs put right 
we categorized our ubs put right and our ars to be level three within the fair value hierarchy 
level three inputs are defined as inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data  some of which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require 
assets and liabilities our total current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  our current liabilities were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in current assets was primarily the result of our reclassifying our investments in ars and ubs put right from long term assets to current assets 
the increase in current liabilities is primarily the result of reclassifying our ubs revolving credit facility from long term to a current liability 
we had cash flows from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  acquisitions of property and equipment  including the acquisition of senior living communities  on a net basis after considering the proceeds from sales of fixed assets to snh  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

during  we purchased and retired a total of million par value of our notes for million plus accrued interest and issued million shares of common stock to snh for an allocated value of million 
during the year ended  as a result of an early repayment of debt  we repaid long term debt of million 
acquisitions including the initiation of long term leases and related financings in april  we acquired a unit assisted living community located in tennessee for million 
we financed the acquisition by assuming a million non recourse hud insured mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand 
the interest rate on the 
table of contents assumed hud insured mortgage is 
residents pay substantially all of our charges at this community from their private resources 
in  we leased from snh senior living communities with a total of  living units 
twenty seven of these communities are assisted living communities one of which offers some skilled nursing services and one of which offers some independent living services  eight are independent living communities and two are continuing care retirement communities which offer independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our rent payable to snh for these communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases for of these communities after in connection with one of the leases we initiated in  we also acquired from the prior owner of the communities its ownership interest in certain operating companies  working capital  certain long term liabilities  and operating practices and processes  especially in the memory care area 
we accounted for this transaction as a business combination and  after allocating the purchase price to applicable assets and liabilities based on their fair value  we recorded as goodwill the  excess consideration over fair value of identifiable assets 
included in the senior living communities described above are seven assisted living communities with units located in pennsylvania and new jersey that were previously operated by newseasons assisted living communities  inc  or newseasons  under a lease from snh 
we leased these communities in july for annual rent of approximately million per year 
in consideration of our lease assumption  newseasons paid us million and transferred title to certain personal property located at the communities 
we recorded the newseasons consideration as a deferred credit on our balance sheet  which we are amortizing as a reduction of rent expense over the remaining lease term 
simultaneously with leasing these seven communities from snh  we purchased three additional newseasons communities from snh with units located in pennsylvania and new jersey for million 
we allocated the purchase price of these communities to land  building and equipment 
the purchase price of these properties equaled the seller s net book value and the fair market value of these properties based on appraisals by an independent appraiser 
the ten newseasons communities complement our business strategy of focusing our operations in high quality senior living assets where residents pay for our services with private resources 
the majority of the revenues from these communities come from residents private resources 
in december  we acquired seven independent and assisted living communities  with a total of living units  located in north carolina and south carolina for a purchase price of million excluding closing costs 
we financed the acquisition with cash on hand and drawings under our credit facility with ubs

our rent payable to snh for this community is  per year 
percentage rent  based on increases in gross revenues at this community  will commence in we added this community to lease no 
with snh  which has a current term expiring in our leases with snh as of december   we leased senior living communities  two rehabilitation hospitals and two assisted living communities which have been classified as discontinued operations from snh under four leases 
our total annual rent payable to snh as of december  was million  excluding percentage rent based on increases in gross revenues at certain properties 
we paid approximately million and million in percentage rent to snh for the years ended december  and  respectively 
upon our request  snh may purchase capital improvements made at the properties we lease from snh and increase our rent pursuant to contractual formulas 
during the year ended december   snh reimbursed us million for capital expenditures made at the properties leased from snh and these purchases resulted in our annual rent being increased by approximately million 
in august  we entered into the lease realignment agreement with snh 
the lease realignment agreement was entered into to assist snh in obtaining mortgage financing  or the loan  from the federal national mortgage association  or fnma  which is secured by properties owned by snh and leased to us  or the properties 
the properties consist of senior living communities with  living units located in states 
in connection with the loan  we realigned our leases with snh 
lease no 
expires in and now includes properties including communities acquired by snh and excluding one community sold by snh in the fourth quarter of and including two communities that we report as discontinued operations  including independent living communities  assisted living communities and snfs

lease no

lease no 
expires in and now includes properties including one community acquired by snh in the fourth quarter of  including independent living communities  assisted living communities and snfs 
in connection with the lease realignment agreement and the loan  we reached an accommodation with snh whereby we sold certain of our personal property at the properties to snh  we encumbered certain of our assets eg  accounts receivable arising from our operation of the properties  we sold  of our common shares to snh and we agreed to certain reporting and other operating obligations required by fnma and we were compensated by snh by receiving a million annual rent reduction for the fixed term of lease no 
and a cash payment of million 
in addition  snh reimbursed us for out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and closing of the loan 
we also granted snh certain registration rights with regard to our common shares sold to snh in connection with the loan 
we allocated the cash payment from snh pursuant to the lease realignment agreement based on the fair value of assets conveyed or expenses reimbursed 
we used our closing share price on the date of the lease realignment agreement to value the  common shares we issued to snh 
we used our net book value  which approximates its fair value as of the date of sale  to value the personal property we sold to snh 
accordingly  we allocated the million in proceeds from snh 
table of contents as follows million to issuance of common shares  million to the sale of personal property and  as reimbursement of costs incurred 
we recorded the remaining unallocated balance of million as an inducement in connection with lease no 
and will amortize this amount over the term of that lease as a reduction of rent expense 
our revenues our revenues from services to residents at our senior living communities and patients of our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics are our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our debt and our capital expenditures 
during the past two years  our occupancy has been negatively affected by weak economic conditions throughout the country 
these conditions have impacted many companies both within and outside of our industry and there can be no certainty as to when current economic conditions  especially the housing market  may materially improve 
although many of the services we provide are needs driven  some of those needs may be deferred during recessionary periods  for example  relocating to a senior living community may be delayed when sales of houses are delayed 
at some of our senior living communities and at our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics  operating revenues for skilled nursing and rehabilitation services are received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare and medicaid revenues were earned primarily at our snfs and our two rehabilitation hospitals 
we derived and of our revenues from these programs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net medicare revenues from services to senior living community residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net medicaid revenues from services to senior living community residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
federal agencies and some members of congress have proposed medicare and medicaid policy changes and freezes on rate increases or rate reductions to be phased in during the next several years 
congress is currently considering national healthcare reform legislation that would affect medicare and medicaid policies and reimbursement for snfs and irfs in federal fiscal year and future years 
the cms has recently adopted rules that it estimates will decrease aggregate medicare payments to snfs by approximately and increase aggregate medicare payments to irfs by approximately in federal fiscal year these rules took effect on october  these estimates of reductions or increases in aggregate medicare payments to snfs and irfs for federal fiscal year may change due to actions of congress or cms 
in addition  some of the states in which we operate either have not raised medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced  or are expected to freeze or reduce  medicaid rates 
the current economic conditions are causing budget shortfalls in many states  increasing the likelihood of medicaid rate reductions  freezes on rate increases  or increases that are insufficient to offset increasing operating costs 
the magnitude of the potential medicare and medicaid rate reductions or changes and the impact on us of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match increasing expenses  as well as the impact on us of the potential medicare and medicaid policy changes  cannot currently be estimated  but they may be material to our operations and may affect our future results of operations 
approximately and of our revenues from our rehabilitation hospitals came from the medicare and medicaid programs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in october  the medicare rates at our irfs increased by approximately over the prior period 
however  this increase was later rescinded and  for payments on and after april   the medicare rate increase was reset to zero percent for federal fiscal years and also  on july   cms issued a rule updating the medicare irf prospective rate formulas for the federal fiscal year the rule revises the weights assigned to patient case mix groups that are used to calculate rates 
table of contents under the irf prospective payment system  and resets the outlier threshold to maintain estimated outlier payments at of total estimated irf payments for the year 
cms has recently adopted an increase of approximately to medicare prospective payment rates at irfs for the fiscal year effective october   to account for inflation and set the outlier limits at of total estimated irf payments 
cms has also adopted regulations clarifying the coverage criteria for medicare payments in irfs  to be effective january  in may  cms issued the rule establishing revised medicare criteria that rehabilitation hospitals are required to meet in order to participate as irfs in the medicare program 
as recently amended  the rule requires that for cost reporting periods starting on and after july   of a facility s inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services for one of the cms s designated medical conditions 
an irf that fails to meet the requirements of this rule is subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider  and the effect of such reclassification would be to lower medicare payment rates 
as of december  and february   we believe our rehabilitation hospitals are operating in compliance with the cms requirements to remain irfs 
however  the actual percentage of patients at our irfs who meet these medicare requirements may not be or remain as high as we believe or anticipate or may decline 
our failure to remain in compliance  or a cms finding of noncompliance  if it occurs  will result in our receiving lower medicare rates than we currently receive at our irfs 
insurance increases over time in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  have had an adverse impact upon our results of operations 
although we self insure a large portion of these costs  our costs have increased as a result of the higher costs that we incur to settle claims and to purchase re insurance for claims in excess of the self insurance amounts 
these increased costs may continue in the future 
for more information about our existing insurance see item business insurance of this annual report on form k 
to obtain control over our insurance costs  and as described herein  we and other companies to which rmr provides management services have formed an insurance company which we expect will begin to underwrite certain of our insurance requirements in the future 
institutional pharmacies between and  we acquired six institutional pharmacies and one mail order pharmacy located in wisconsin  nebraska  california  south carolina and virginia 
our total purchase price for these pharmacies was million 
certain of our pharmacy businesses have been discontinued and either sold or closed  as described below 
rehabilitation hospitals we commenced operations at our two hospitals on october  discontinued operations during  we agreed with snh that it should sell two assisted living communities in pennsylvania  which we currently lease 
we and snh are in the process of selling these assisted living communities and  upon their sale  our annual rent payable to snh will decrease by an amount equal to of the net proceeds of the sale to snh 

table of contents in december  we decided to sell our institutional pharmacy located in california and our mail order pharmacy located in nebraska 
the assets and liabilities related to these two institutional pharmacies are presented separately in the december  consolidated balance sheet 
we sold the institutional pharmacy in two separate transactions in the year ended december   which resulted in a gain on sale of million 
we were unable to sell the mail order pharmacy on acceptable terms and we ceased its operations on march  during  with our approval  snh sold two snfs which we lease from snh 
on october   snh sold a snf located in iowa to an unaffiliated party for net proceeds of approximately  and our annual rent payable to snh under lease no 
decreased by approximately  on november   snh sold a snf located in missouri to an unaffiliated party for net proceeds of approximately million and our annual rent payable to snh under lease no 
decreased by approximately  as of december   we had disposed of substantially all of our assets and liabilities related to the assisted living communities which we expect to sell and the two snfs which were sold during we have reclassified the consolidated statement of income for all periods presented to show the results of operations of the communities and pharmacies which have been sold or are expected to be sold as discontinued 
below is a summary of the operating results of these discontinued operations included in the financial statements for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands for the years ended december  revenues expenses gain on sale net loss contractual obligations table as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations debt obligations operating lease obligations accrued self insurance obligations total debt obligations consist of the amounts due under several hud insured mortgages  our ubs credit facility as well as our outstanding notes 
operating lease obligations consist of the annual lease payments to snh and hcpi through the lease terms ending between and these amounts do not include percentage rent that may become payable under these leases 
accrued self insurance obligations reflected on our balance sheet are insurance reserves related to workers compensation and professional liability insurance 

table of contents debt financings and covenants in april  we financed the acquisition of a unit assisted living community located in tennessee for million by assuming a million non recourse  hud insured mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand 
the coupon interest rate on the assumed hud insured mortgage is and its effective market rate is 
in october  we issued million principal amount of notes 
our net proceeds from this issuance were approximately million 
these notes are convertible into our common shares at any time 
the initial conversion rate  which is subject to adjustment  is common shares per  principal amount of notes  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these notes mature on october  we may prepay the notes at any time after october  and the note holders may require that we purchase all or a portion of these notes on each of october of  and we issued these notes pursuant to an indenture which contains various customary covenants 
as of december  and february   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants of this indenture 
during  we retired million par value of our outstanding notes that we had purchased for million plus accrued interest 
we funded these purchases principally by borrowings under our ubs credit facility  with cash generated by our operations and with proceeds we received from snh pursuant to the lease realignment agreement 
as a result of these purchases  we recorded a gain of million net of related unamortized costs on early extinguishment of debt  and million in principal amount of the notes remain outstanding 
we have a million revolving secured credit facility with a financial institution available for general business purposes  including acquisitions and working capital  which is currently scheduled to expire in may the amount we are able to borrow at any time is subject to limitations based upon qualifying collateral 
we are the borrower under this revolving credit facility and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the facility  which is secured by our and our guarantor subsidiaries accounts receivable  deposit accounts and related assets 
the facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain collateral  minimum net worth and certain other financial ratios  and this facility also places limits on our ability to incur or assume debt or create liens with respect to certain of our assets and has other customary provisions 
in certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals  the maximum amounts which we may borrow under this credit facility may be increased to million 
as of december  and february   no amounts were outstanding with million available under this credit facility 
as of december  and february   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this credit facility 
we may borrow additional amounts under the facility before it expires in may if we have outstanding borrowings under the facility and are unable to extend it when it expires  we would need to explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives may include incurring additional debt and engaging in sale leaseback transactions relating to some or all of our owned communities 
while we believe we will be able to replace this facility before it expires  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that our cost associated with any such transaction will be reasonable 
also  the current market conditions have led to materially increased credit spreads which  if they continue  may result in a material increase in the interest rate under this facility  or a replacement facility  when and if it is replaced 
in november  we entered into a non recourse credit facility with ubs which is available for acquisitions  working capital and general business purposes and had a principal amount available to us of of the fair value of the ars which are collateral for the loan 
in december  ubs increased the principal amount available to us from to up to of the varying market value of 
table of contents the ars 
our interest rate under the credit facility will also vary depending on the interest payable to us on the ars  but will not exceed libor plus basis points

as of december  and february   we have million and million outstanding under this credit facility  respectively  and million and approximately million remained available for drawing as of december  and february   respectively 
as of december  and february   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this credit facility

two of the letters of credit  totaling million  provide security for our self insured workers compensation and professional liability programs and the remaining seven letters of credit totaling million are security for our four properties leased from hcpi  two of our properties encumbered by hud insured mortgages  an automobile leasing company and a utility company that provides services to one of our senior living communities 
eight of the letters of credit are renewed annually and one is renewed quarterly 
maturity dates for these letters of credit range from march to september in  we prepaid seven mortgages that were secured by six of our senior living communities 
we paid million to retire these seven mortgages  which consisted of approximately million in principal and interest and  in prepayment penalties 
because we had carried these mortgages at a premium to their face value  we recognized a net gain of million in connection with the early extinguishment of debt 
in september  we prepaid two hud insured mortgages that were secured by one of our senior living communities 
we paid million in principal and interest to retire these two mortgages  and no prepayment penalty was required 
because we had recorded these mortgages at a premium to their face value under applicable accounting rules  we recognized a net gain of  in connection with this early extinguishment of debt 
at december   three of our communities remained encumbered by hud insured mortgages totaling million 
the weighted average interest rate on these mortgages is 
payments of principal and interest are due monthly until maturities at varying dates ranging from june to july these mortgages contain standard hud mortgage covenants 
as of december  and february   we believe we are in compliance with all covenants of these mortgages

at the time of our spin off  all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of snh 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with snh and others 
since then we have entered into various leases and other agreements which confirm and modify these undertakings 
among other matters  these agreements provide that so long as snh remains a real estate investment trust  or a reit  we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our equity shares without the consent of snh  
table of contents so long as we are a tenant of snh  we will not permit nor take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of snh  might jeopardize the tax status of snh as a reit  snh has the option to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with snh upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change in control events affecting us  as defined in those documents including  in certain of the snh leases  the adoption of any shareholder proposal other than a precatory proposal or the election to our board of directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved  nominated or appointed  as the case may be  by vote of a majority of our directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual  the resolution of certain disputes  claims and controversies arising from our leases with snh may be referred to binding arbitration proceedings  and so long as we have a business management agreement with rmr we will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving snh or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which snh or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invests

rmr provides certain management  administrative and information system services to us under the business management agreement 
the business management agreement provides for compensation to rmr at an annual rate equal to of our total revenues from all sources reportable under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
also  rmr is compensated at a rate equal to of the employment expenses of rmr s employees  other than its chief information officer  actively engaged in servicing management information systems 
the business management agreement is effective until december   and will be automatically renewed for successive one year terms thereafter unless we or rmr give notice of non renewal before the end of an applicable term 
we or rmr may terminate the business management agreement upon days prior written notice 
rmr may also terminate the business management agreement upon five business days notice if we undergo a change of control  as defined in the business management agreement 
our board has given our compensation committee  which is comprised exclusively of our independent directors  sole authority to act on our behalf with respect to this agreement

under the committee s charter  the committee must also annually evaluate and approve the compensation paid to rmr under 
table of contents the agreement 
the aggregate fees paid by us to rmr for management  administrative and information system services for were million

a termination of our business management agreement is an event of default under our revolving credit facility  if not approved by a majority of our lenders 
the fact that rmr has responsibilities to other entities  including our largest landlord  snh  could create conflicts  and in the event of such conflicts between snh and us  our business management agreement with rmr allows rmr to act on behalf of snh rather than on our behalf 
the business management agreement includes restrictions on our ability to invest in or finance any real estate property of a type then owned or financed by a publicly owned entity managed by rmr 
under the business management agreement  rmr has agreed not to provide business management services to any other business or enterprise  other than snh  that is directly competitive with our business

barry portnoy and gerard martin  our managing directors  are directors of rmr 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also officers and employees of rmr 
these officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the remainder to rmr s business which is separate from our business 
we believe the compensation we paid to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time  however  periodically  these individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessments of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  reserves related to our self insurance programs  income tax valuation allowances and our valuations of our goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculations 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge of current rules and regulations applicable to these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment and sometimes retroactive legislative changes 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable based upon our experience  involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivables  the terms of the agreements with our residents  their third party payors or other obligors  the residents or payors stated intent to pay  the residents or payors financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or rate and payment appeal proceedings 
determining reserves for the self insurance portions of our insurance programs involves significant judgments based upon our experience  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  claims experience  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
we also periodically receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves 
despite these efforts  these reserves have sometimes proved to be materially inaccurate 
because we have historically reported losses  we do not currently recognize the benefit of all of our deferred tax assets  including tax loss carry forwards that may be used to offset future taxable income 
we will  however  continue to assess our ability to generate sufficient taxable income during future periods in which our deferred tax assets may be realized 
when we believe that we will more likely than not realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  we will record deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations  which will affect our results of operations 

table of contents we review goodwill annually during our fourth quarter  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances exist  for impairment 
if our review indicates that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  we reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which we determined to be the segments we operate  by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit as determined by its discounted cash flows and market approaches  such as capitalization rates and earnings multiples  with its carrying value 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue growth  gross margins and our weighted average cost of capital 
we select a growth rate based on our view of the growth prospect of each of our segments 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
during our annual goodwill impairment review  we determined no impairments should be recorded 
during the fourth quarter of our market capitalization declined and was significantly below the then current book value 
as a result  we determined an interim impairment test was necessary and performed the interim test on all of our reporting units as of december  in our evaluation we weighed all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an impairment occurred 
as a result  we determined to reduce the value of goodwill reported on our balance sheet related to our pharmacies as of december  by million 
we review the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  we determine the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance  recent sales of similar assets  market conditions and projected undiscounted cash flows that our asset or asset groups are expected to generate 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
as a result of this test we determined to reduce the value of our long lived assets reported on our balance sheet related to our rehabilitation hospital reporting unit as of december  by million 
during our we determined that no impairment charges were required 
some of our judgments and estimates are based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party professionals 
any errors in our estimates or judgments affecting our critical accounting policy could have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to the premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
recently announced accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued the codification that is the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles and is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of the codification did not cause any material change to our current accounting practices 
effective june   we adopted the subsequent events topic of the codification 
this topic establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through 
table of contents which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and whether that date represents the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the business combinations topic of the codification establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer will recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination principally by expanding the definition of what constitutes a business combination  making it more likely that our acquisitions will be accounted for as business combinations  and by requiring the immediate expensing of acquisition costs incurred in connection with such transactions 
this topic is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the adoption affects our consolidated financial statements  principally by requiring us to expense acquisition costs 
effective june   we adopted the interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments subtopic of the financial instruments topic of the codification 
please see our notes to consolidated financial statements no 
 fair value of assets and liabilities for relevant disclosures 
in april  the fasb issued the following topics determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  and  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the first topic provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the assets or liabilities have significantly decreased 
this topic also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
the other than temporary impairments topic amends existing other than temporary impairment guidance relating to debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities 
the interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments topic requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
each of these topics is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the adoption of these topics did not cause any material changes to our disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the united states has been modest

rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also  our ability to affect rate increases paid by the medicare and medicaid programs will be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consists of our fixed minimum rental obligations to snh and hcpi 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our senior living business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and relocations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe 
table of contents that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
impact of climate change the current political debates about world climate changes has resulted in various existing and proposed treaties  laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions 
we believe treaties  laws and regulations which may limit carbon emissions may cause energy costs at our communities to increase 
in the longer term  we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our patients  residents and other customers in higher charges for our services 
however  in the short term  these increased costs  if material in amount  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by  the market value of our million fixed rate mortgage debt and million notes outstanding on december  would decline by about million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the market value of our million fixed rate mortgage debt and million notes outstanding on december   would increase by about million 
our revolving line of credit bears interest at floating rates and matures in may as of december  and february   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility require annual interest at libor plus a spread 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term  interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of million were drawn under our credit facility and interest rates increased or decreased by per annum  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  per year  or per share  based on our currently outstanding common shares 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would occur over time 
in november  we entered into a non recourse credit facility with ubs secured by our ars 
as of december  and february   million and million was outstanding under this credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and interest payments under this non recourse credit facility will vary depending on the interest payable on the ars  but will not exceed libor plus basis points 
because the interest we pay on this ubs facility depends  in part  on the interest we earn on our ars and our spread is capped  we do not believe changes in interest rates are likely to have a material impact upon our net cost of borrowings under this ubs facility or upon our results of operations 
the amount of money we may borrow under this ubs credit facility depends upon the market value of our ars 
because our ars are income securities  it is likely that the market value of our ars will be affected by changes in interest rates  as interest rates increase the market value of our ars might decline  and as interest rates decrease the market value on our ars should increase 

table of contents however  there are other factors which might impact the market value of our ars  such as supply and demand and liquidity  such that we do not believe the impact of interest rate changes upon the value of our ars and our borrowing capacity under the ubs credit facility can be precisely determined 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
