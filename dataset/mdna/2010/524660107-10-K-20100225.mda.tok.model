item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page  and note c on page and note d on page in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
portfolio management we now manage our business units as a portfolio  with different roles grow  core  fix  divest for each business unit based upon competitive advantages  strategic position  and financial health 
during we implemented a rigorous strategic planning process  in part to continually assess each business unit s portfolio role 
historically  we managed all businesses fairly uniformly  with each awarded capital and expected to grow significantly  that is no longer the case 
business units in the grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth in competitively advantaged positions 
core business units are expected to enhance productivity  maintain market share  and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital 
business units in the fix category will be given a limited time in which to significantly improve performance with some latitude given them due to the weak economy 
finally  a few small business units and portions of business units are considered non strategic  and will likely be divested as the m a market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices 
improving returns and margins on our asset base to remain in the portfolio  business units are expected to consistently generate after tax returns in excess of the company s cost of capital 
each business unit has opportunity to improve  and may employ a variety of means to achieve higher returns including trimming expenses  introducing new products  improving productivity  adopting more disciplined pricing  reducing working capital  and consolidating assets 
business units that fail to consistently maintain minimum return goals will move to the fix or divest categories 
during significant effort went into improving margins  despite economy driven reductions in sales 
ebit margin for was on billion of sales while ebit margin for was on sales of billion 
gross margin for and was and  respectively 
disciplined growth for the near term we expect to focus on better managing the current asset base and improving returns 
that pursuit will require much of senior management s attention  and during this period revenue growth is likely to be minimal 
over the longer term  the company expects to focus its growth efforts on a narrower set of higher quality opportunities  with a target of annual revenue growth 
growth capital will be predominantly earmarked for the grow business units  which are expected to expand at 
table of contents part i rates in excess of us gross domestic product gdp growth 
core business units  for the most part  are operating in markets that grow more slowly than gdp  and are expected to at least maintain market share 
longer term growth is expected to incorporate product innovation and opportunities to enter new  higher growth businesses that meet strict criteria 
acquisitions and divestitures historically  our typical acquisition targets have been small  private  profitable  entrepreneurial companies that manufacture goods either within our existing product lines or one step away from those product lines and complementary to our existing businesses 
as part of our change in strategic direction  we expect fewer and more strategic acquisitions to be completed 
all acquisitions should create value by enhancing tsr  they should have clear strategic rationale and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets 
and acquisitions we had no significant acquisitions in or acquisitions we acquired three businesses during with annualized sales of approximately million broken down by segment as follows commercial fixturing components million industrial materials million specialized products million in commercial fixturing components we added one business located in china that produces office chair controls 
we also added one business to the industrial materials segment  which produces coated wire products  including racks for dishwashers 
finally  in the specialized products segment  we added a business which is a designer and assembler of docking stations that secure computer and other electronic equipment inside vehicles 
for further information about acquisitions  see note r on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
divestitures we divested the coated fabrics business unit previously in the residential furnishings segment in the third quarter of no significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit 
coated fabrics is reflected as a discontinued operation with revenue of approximately million 
an additional business unit  storage products  is targeted for divestiture 
although market conditions have delayed the timing of this disposition  we are fully committed to selling this business 

table of contents part i divestitures we divested five significant businesses in with annualized sales of approximately million 
the largest divestiture approximately million in annualized revenue was the aluminum products segment which was sold in july we also sold four other business units in wood products and fibers previously in the residential furnishings segment  plastics previously in the commercial fixturing components segment  and the dealer portion of commercial vehicle products previously in the specialized products segment 
we received after tax cash proceeds of approximately million for the five divested businesses  not including subordinated notes and preferred stock 
all of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations 
divestitures in the first quarter of  we divested our prime foam products business unit previously in the residential furnishings segment and received after tax cash proceeds of approximately million 
our former prime foam products business unit had annual revenue of approximately million and has been classified as a discontinued operation

foreign operations the percentages of our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the united states for the previous three years are shown below 
logo 
table of contents part i our international continuing operations are principally located in europe  china  canada and mexico 
the products we make in these countries primarily consist of europe innersprings for mattresses wire and wire products lumbar and seat suspension systems for automotive seating machinery and equipment designed to manufacture innersprings for mattresses and other bedding related components design and distribution of point of purchase displays for retailers china innersprings for mattresses recliner mechanisms and bases for upholstered furniture formed wire for upholstered furniture retail store fixtures and gondola shelving office furniture components  including chair bases and casters stamped seat frames and formed metal products for automotive seating cables and small electric motors used in lumbar systems for automotive seating machinery and replacement parts for machines used in the bedding industry canada innersprings for mattresses fabricated wire for the bedding  furniture and automotive industries chair bases  table bases and office chair controls lumbar supports for automotive seats wire and steel storage systems and racks for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles mexico innersprings and fabricated wire for the bedding industry retail shelving and point of purchase displays automotive control cable systems our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe demand for components is growing 
also  in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas  we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently 
our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country 
these risks include nationalization of private enterprises political instability in certain countries foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights credit risks increased costs due to tariffs  customs and shipping rates potential problems obtaining raw materials  and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war foreign currency fluctuation 
table of contents part i our specialized products segment  which derives of its trade sales from foreign operations is particularly subject to the above risks 
these and other foreign related risks could result in cost increases  reduced profits  the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business 
geographic areas of operation we have production  warehousing and distribution facilities in countries around the world 
below is a list of countries where we have facilities associated with continuing operations residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products north america canada n n n mexico n n n united states n n n n europe austria n belgium n croatia n n denmark n germany n hungary n italy n n switzerland n united kingdom n n n south america uruguay n brazil n asia pacific australia n china n n n india n south korea n africa south africa n for further information concerning our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the united states and our tangible long lived assets outside the united states  refer to note f on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents part i sales by product line the following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales from continuing operations by classes of similar products for the last three years product line bedding group furniture group fabric carpet underlay group wire group fixture display group automotive group office furniture components group commercial vehicle products group machinery group tubing group distribution of products in each of our segments  we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own sales personnel 
however  many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors 
we do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would  if terminated  have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
raw materials the products we manufacture in continuing operations require a variety of raw materials 
among the most important are various types of steel  including scrap  rod  wire  coil  sheet and angle iron foam scrap woven and non woven fabrics we supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make 
for example  we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire  which we then use to manufacture innersprings and foundations for mattresses springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas displays  shelving and racks for retailers automotive seating components we supply the majority of our steel rod requirements through our own rod mill 
our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our us requirements for steel wire 
we also produce welded steel tubing both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers 
in addition  we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials we use 
we have experienced volatility in raw material prices over the past few years  most notably in steel 
steel costs increased significantly in and we implemented price 
table of contents part i increases to recover these higher costs 
market prices for steel began to decrease in late  but with the precipitous drop in demand late in the year and our inability to cancel or return higher priced earlier purchases  we entered with high steel costs in inventory 
as steel costs decreased in  we implemented selective price reductions  however at current commodity cost levels  we have enhanced our margins 
the future pricing of raw materials is uncertain 
the degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover higher costs  should they occur  could influence our future earnings 
also  if raw material costs decrease there may be downward pressure on selling prices  temporarily resulting in lower segment margins as we consume higher cost inventories 
higher raw material costs in recent years have led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components have been replaced with lower cost components  causing us to shift production accordingly 
this has primarily impacted profit margins in our residential furnishings and industrial materials segments 
we are responding by developing new products including new types of innersprings and box springs that enable our customers to reduce their total costs  and in certain instances  provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
customer concentration we serve thousands of customers worldwide  sustaining many long term business relationships 
in  no customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations 
our top customers accounted for approximately of these consolidated revenues 
the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company  as a whole  or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported  including our residential furnishings  commercial fixturing components and specialized products segments 

table of contents part i patents and trademarks the chart below shows the approximate numbers of patents issued  patents in process  trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations at the end of no single patent or group of patents  or trademark or group of trademarks  is material to our continuing operations 
most of our patents and trademarks relate to products sold in the specialized products and residential furnishings segments 
logo some of our most significant trademarks include semi flex boxspring components and foundations mira coil  verticoil  lura flex and superlastic mattress innersprings lifestyles  s cape and adjustables by leggett platt adjustable electric beds wall hugger recliner chair mechanisms super sagless motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms no sag wire forms used in seating tack jump and pattern link quilting machines hanes fiber materials schukra  pullmaflex and flex o lator automotive seating products spuhl mattress innerspring manufacturing machines gribetz and porter quilting and sewing machines quietflex and masterack equipment and accessories for vans and trucks research and development we maintain research  engineering and testing centers in carthage  missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities 
we are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas 
however  we estimate the cost of research and development associated with continuing operations ranged from to million per year in each of the last three years 

table of contents part i employees as of december   we had approximately  employees associated with our continuing operations  of which roughly  were engaged in production 
of the  approximately  are international employees 
labor unions represent roughly of our employees associated with continuing operations 
we did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during the chart below shows the approximate number of employees associated with continuing operations by segment 
logo as of december   we had approximately  employees associated with continuing operations 
employees in discontinued operations at december   we had approximately employees associated with discontinued operations  all of which are in the commercial fixturing components segment 
as of december  and  the company had approximately and  employees  respectively  associated with its discontinued operations 
for more information on our discontinued operations  see note b on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell 
the number of competing companies varies by product line  but many of the markets for our 
table of contents part i products are highly competitive 
we tend to attract and retain customers through product quality  innovation  competitive pricing and customer service 
many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer in north america  in terms of revenue  of the following components for residential furniture and bedding carpet underlay components for office furniture drawn steel wire automotive seat support and lumbar systems adjustable beds bedding industry machinery for wire forming  sewing and quilting we face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  we believe our operations should be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
accordingly  at the end of  leggett operated facilities in china 
in recent years we experienced increased competition in the us from foreign bedding component manufacturers 
we reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices  and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
the increased price competition for bedding components was partially due to lower wire costs in china 
asian manufacturers benefit from cost advantages for commodities such as steel and chemicals 
foreign manufacturers also benefit from lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters 
in late  we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from china  south africa and vietnam 
we saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during after the antidumping investigations began 
as a result  we regained market share and performance in our bedding group improved 
the investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early the current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant  ranging from to  and should remain in effect for at least another four years 
imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices  however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and misclassifying the actual country of origin 
leggett  along with several us manufacturers of steel wire products with active antidumping and antidumping countervailing duty orders  formed a coalition and are working with members of congress  the us department of commerce  and us customs and border protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and or countervailing duty orders 
seasonality as a diversified manufacturer  we generally have not experienced significant seasonality 
the timing of acquisitions  dispositions  and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses 
nevertheless  for the company as a whole  the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower 

table of contents part i our four segments tend to experience seasonality as follows residential furnishings typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during those periods 
commercial fixturing components generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products  with the first and fourth quarters normally lower 
this aligns with the retail industry s normal construction cycle the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season 
industrial materials minimal variation in sales throughout the year 
specialized products relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer 
backlog our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments 
production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships 
working capital items for further information regarding working capital items  see the discussion of cash from operations in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment 
we have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws 
while we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies  management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  capital expenditures  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the us congress is currently considering legislation to address climate change that is intended to reduce overall green house gas emissions  including carbon dioxide 
similar initiatives are being pursued at the state level as well 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency has made a determination that green house gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment 
it is uncertain if  when  and in what form  a mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or regulation 
however  if enacted  this type of program could materially increase our operating costs  including costs of raw materials  transportation and electricity 
in that event  our intent would be to raise prices in order to cover the cost increases

item a 
risk factors 
investing in our securities involves risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 
we have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products 
as a supplier of products to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence 
to a lesser extent  market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors  including disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs and interest rates 
all of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and drive demand for our products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand weakness in the majority of our markets in led to lower unit orders  sales and earnings in our businesses 
several factors  including a weak global economy  a depressed housing market  and low consumer confidence contributed to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world 
short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends  however  we currently expect market demand to stabilize at these lower levels 
if economic and market conditions remain depressed or deteriorate further  we may experience material negative impacts on our business  financial condition  operating cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents part i deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we serve customers in a variety of industries  some of which are experiencing unprecedented decreases in demand that began in late and have continued through  due to the weak global economy 
while we currently expect markets to stabilize  a sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers  or a group of less significant customers  could become insolvent  which could adversely impact our sales  net earnings  financial condition  cash flow and liquidity 
costs of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results 
raw material cost increases and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases can significantly impact our earnings 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  therefore  our raw material costs move with the market 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we attempt to implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can negatively impact our earnings 
also  raw material cost decreases generally allow us to pass through reduced selling prices to our customers 
reduced selling prices tied to higher cost inventory reduces our segment margins and earnings 
steel is our most significant raw material 
the global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been extremely volatile in recent years 
this volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year 
our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of foam scrap 
we experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of this commodity in recent years 
higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components 
this has primarily impacted our residential furnishings and industrial materials product mix and decreased profit margins 
this trend could further negatively impact our results of operations 
we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
continued economic uncertainty could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets 
asian competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
we believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price  but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a 
table of contents part i portion of their components and finished products from asia 
if we are unable to purchase key raw materials  such as steel  at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers  our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed 
our goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to potential impairment 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long lived assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately billion  or approximately of our total assets 
in addition  net property  plant and equipment  sundry assets and non current assets held for sale totaled approximately million  or approximately of total assets 
we review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in june as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing  and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists 
in addition  we test for the recoverability of long lived assets at year end  and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated no goodwill impairments 
goodwill associated with reporting units whose fair values exceeded the carrying value by was million  million of goodwill was associated with reporting units that had excess fair value  and million of goodwill was associated with reporting units that had fair values in excess of the carrying values by greater than 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment in discontinued operations of million for our storage products unit because the carrying value of the assets held for sale exceeded fair value less costs to sell 
fair value and the resulting impairment charge were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers 
for the year ended  other long lived asset impairments were million  substantially all of which were in continuing operations  for fixed assets to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell 
if actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long lived asset calculations  we could incur future unanticipated impairment charges  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales  which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in  of our sales from continuing operations were generated by international operations 
the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  however  certain of our operations experience currency related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
further  our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results

table of contents part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
highlights as we entered  we were facing some of the most challenging market conditions that we ve experienced in decades and we recognized that there was little we could do to influence that reality 
therefore  our focus remained on several key activities that we could control  including aggressive cost containment  headcount reduction  facility consolidation  maintaining strict discipline on pricing  and optimizing working capital levels 
as a result of our efforts in these areas  we exited with significantly improved ebit margins despite much lower sales  and for the year  we generated the second highest level of operating cash flow in our history 
our global markets stabilized in  albeit at very low demand levels 
for the full year  sales decreased due primarily to weak market demand  but also to a combination of steel related price deflation and our decision to exit specific customer programs with unacceptable profit margins 
we strive to achieve tsr in the top one third of the s p over the long term  which we believe will require average tsr of per year 
for the period beginning january  through december   our tsr ranks within the top of the s p reflecting confidence in our strategic progress  margin improvement  strong cash generation  and the stability we believe has developed in our markets  in august  we increased our quarterly dividend modestly to 
per share 
we also utilized essentially all the board s authorization enabling us to repurchase million shares of our stock in  with the majority of the purchases occurring during the last half of the year 
our financial profile remains strong 
we ended with net debt to net capital well below our long term targeted range  no significant fixed term debt maturing until  and nearly million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility 
these topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 

table of contents part ii introduction what we do leggett platt is a diversified manufacturer  and member of the s p index  that conceives  designs  and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in most homes  offices  and automobiles  and many retail stores 
we make components that are often hidden within  but integral to  our customers products 
we are north america s leading independent manufacturer of components for residential furniture and bedding  carpet underlay  components for office furniture  drawn steel wire  automotive seat support and lumbar systems  and bedding industry machinery 
our segments our continuing operations are composed of business units in four segments  with approximately  employees  and more than production facilities located in countries around the world 
our segments are described below 
logo residential furnishings this segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products 
we also sell carpet cushion  adjustable beds  bed frames  ornamental beds  and geo components 
commercial fixturing components operations in this segment manufacture and sell store fixtures and point of purchase displays used in retail stores 
we also produce chair controls  bases  and other components for office furniture manufacturers 

table of contents part ii industrial materials these operations primarily supply steel rod  drawn steel wire  steel billets  and welded steel tubing to other leggett operations and to external customers 
our wire and tubing is used to make bedding  furniture  automotive seats  wire retail fixtures  mechanical springs  and many other end products 
specialized products from this segment we supply lumbar systems and wire components used by automotive seating manufacturers 
we manufacture and install the racks  shelving and cabinets used to outfit fleets of service vans 
we also produce machinery  both for ourselves and for others  including bedding manufacturers 
discontinued operations and divestitures during the past two years  we have divested six businesses 
in  we sold our aluminum products segment and four smaller business units wood products  fibers  plastics  and the dealer portion of commercial vehicle products 
in  we sold the coated fabrics business unit 
we received after tax cash proceeds of million for these six businesses  exceeding our original estimate of approximately million 
one additional business unit storage products is also targeted for divestiture 
results of operations for all of these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
for the remaining divestiture  we expect to recover the carrying value of the net assets held for sale 
net assets classified as held for sale totaled million at december  this includes million not associated with the storage products business 
although recent market conditions have delayed the timing of the final disposition  we are fully committed to selling this business 
strategic direction in late  we outlined significant changes to the company s strategy 
we adopted a new primary financial metric total shareholder return  adopted role based portfolio management  implemented more rigorous strategic planning  and changed the priorities for use of cash 
our goals  in sequential order  were to i divest low performing businesses  ii return more cash to investors  iii improve margins and returns  and iv begin to carefully and conservatively grow the company at of annual revenue 
we have made significant progress over the past two years 
total shareholder return tsr is the key financial measure that we use to monitor performance 
tsr is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay 
tsr change in stock price dividends beginning stock price 
we focus on four key sources of tsr revenue growth  margin expansion  dividends  and share repurchases 
historically  our primary objective was profitable growth 
going forward  we intend to generate higher tsr through a balanced approach that employs all four sources of tsr 
in  dividends and stock buybacks largely drove our tsr  during  we benefited significantly from margin improvement  and within a few years we expect that modest 
table of contents part ii annual sales growth will also contribute to tsr 
beginning in  we introduced tsr based incentives for senior executives and modified business unit bonuses to give more importance to achieving higher returns on the assets under their direct control 
for the two year period ended december   our tsr performance places us within the top of the s p companies 
we narrowed our focus and eliminated during and approximately of our portfolio through the divestiture of the aluminum products segment and five additional business units one divestiture remains 
we also narrowed the scope of the store fixtures unit to focus primarily on the metals part of the fixtures industry  in alignment with leggett s core competency of producing steel and steel related products 
these activities were largely complete by the end of  and resulted in charges that impacted our operating results primarily in and 
those charges are discussed on page under the section titled asset impairments and restructuring related charges 
we have implemented a more rigorous strategic planning process to assess our business units and help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles  capital allocation priorities  and new areas in which to grow 
we review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role grow  core  fix  or divest 
this review includes criteria such as competitive position  market attractiveness  business unit size  and fit within our overall objectives  as well as financial indicators such as ebitda growth  operating cash flows  and return on assets 
to remain in the portfolio  business units are expected to consistently generate after tax returns in excess of our cost of capital 
business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the fix or divest categories 
the majority of our business units are categorized as core 
a much smaller percentage are categorized as grow  consequently  we recognize as a strategic imperative the need to expand the grow category by improving i our success rate at developing innovative new products and ii our abilities to identify new growth platforms 
a few small business units are considered fix  and must improve their performance within a reasonable time frame with some latitude given them due to the weak economy 
finally  a few small business units and portions of business units are considered non strategic  and will likely be divested as the m a market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices 
the strategic changes have increased available cash 
we expect to continue returning much of this cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
customers we serve a broad suite of customers  with no single one representing over of our sales 
many are companies whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding  a variety of other manufacturers  and many major retailers 

table of contents part ii major factors that impact our business many factors impact our business  but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand  raw material cost trends  and competition 
market demand market demand including product mix is impacted by several economic factors  with consumer confidence being most significant 
other important factors include disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  and interest rates 
all these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore affect demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand weakness in the majority of our markets during led to lower unit orders  utilization levels  sales and earnings 
several factors  including weak global economies  a depressed housing market  and low consumer confidence contributed to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world 
short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into future demand trends  however  we currently expect demand to stabilize at these lower levels 
given our balance sheet strength  operating cash flow and access to credit  we expect to be able to endure an extended downturn in market demand with no material impact to our financial position or liquidity 
activities completed over the past few years including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan  closure of certain underperforming and underutilized facilities  elimination of sales with unacceptable margins  and other cost reduction initiatives improved our cost position in advance of the late economic contraction  and we continued to tightly constrain spending in we face decisions about further facility consolidation but have chosen to retain excess capacity because we believe that eventually market demand will improve 
with our currently low utilization levels  we should be able to readily accommodate that demand improvement when it occurs 
raw material costs in many of our businesses  we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials 
this purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have 
still  our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials many of which are commodities fluctuate 
purchasing arrangements vary across the company 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  accordingly  our raw material costs generally move with the market 
in certain of our businesses  we have longer term purchase contracts with pricing terms that provide stability under reasonable market conditions 
however  when commodities experience extreme inflation  vendors do not always honor those contracts 
our ability to recover higher costs through selling price increases is crucial 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
conversely  when costs decrease significantly  we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers 
the timing of our price increases or decreases is a critical factor  we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs  so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline 

table of contents part ii steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity 
in most cases  the major changes both increases and decreases were passed through to customers via selling price adjustments 
steel costs increased significantly in and we implemented price increases to recover these higher costs 
market prices for steel began to decrease in late  but with the precipitous drop in demand late in the year and our inability to cancel or return higher priced earlier purchases  we entered with high cost steel in inventory 
as steel costs decreased in  we implemented selective price reductions  however at the lower commodity cost levels  we enhanced our margins 
as a producer of steel rod  we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod 
the increase in scrap costs in late and early has resulted in currently lower metal margins in the steel market and in our rod producing operation 
while pricing trends in the steel market are difficult to predict  we expect the lower metal margins to continue in our other raw materials include woven and non woven fabrics  foam scrap  and chemicals 
we have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years  and typically pass them through to our customers 
when we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs  this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components 
we experienced this de contenting effect in our residential furnishings and industrial materials segments in recent years 
as our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address steel and chemical inflation  our profit margins were negatively impacted 
we are responding by developing new products including new types of mattress innersprings and boxsprings that enable our customers to reduce their total costs  and in certain instances  provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
competition many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line 
in general  our competitors tend to be smaller  private companies 
we believe we gain competitive advantage in our global markets through low cost operations  significant internal production of key raw materials  manufacturing expertise and product innovation  higher quality products  extensive customer service capabilities  and financial strength 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive  while delivering product quality  innovation  and customer service 
we continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia 
in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
we currently operate facilities in china 
in recent years we experienced increased competition in the us from foreign bedding component manufacturers 
we reacted to this competition by selectively adjusting prices  
table of contents part ii and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
the increased price competition for bedding components was partially due to lower wire costs in china 
certain foreign manufacturers also benefit from more lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters 
in late  we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from china  south africa and vietnam 
we saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during after the antidumping investigations began 
as a result  we regained market share and performance in our bedding group improved 
the investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early the current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant  ranging from to  and should remain in effect for at least another four years 
imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices  however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and misclassifying the actual country of origin 
leggett  along with several us manufacturers of steel wire products with active antidumping and antidumping countervailing duty orders  formed a coalition and are working with members of congress  the us department of commerce  and us customs and border protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and or countervailing duty orders 
asset impairments and restructuring related charges net impairment and restructuring related charges for both continuing and discontinued operations totaled million over the last three years million in  million in  and million in 
the majority of these charges  or million  occurred as a result of the strategic plan announced in late million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  we believe this activity to be substantially complete

table of contents part ii results of operations vs

full year earnings from continuing operations also decreased in the earnings impact from lower unit volume was largely offset by cost reduction initiatives and pricing discipline 
other factors impacting the year over year earnings comparison are presented in the table above 
the divestiture note write down identified in the table occurred when we learned in that the aluminum operations divested in july needed a capital infusion from the buyer due to deterioration in business conditions 
this led to a reduction in the value of the note we accepted in as partial payment for the divesture 
leggett has accepted a more subordinate position in the capital structure of the divested operations 
lifo impact all of our segments use the first in  first out fifo method for valuing inventory 
in our consolidated financials  an adjustment is made at the corporate level ie outside the segments to convert about of our inventories to the last in  first out lifo method 
these are primarily our domestic  steel related inventories 
we experienced a large swing in the lifo impact during the past two years 
in  significant steel cost inflation along with moderately higher inventory levels resulted in lifo expense from continuing operations of million 
in  steel cost decreases and lower inventory levels resulted in a lifo benefit from continuing operations of million 
segment level earnings in generally benefited under the fifo method from the effect of rising commodity costs  but in the first half of  were significantly burdened as we consumed higher cost steel both in inventory and committed under purchase agreements while selling prices decreased 
the lifo impact recognized at the corporate level is generally offset each year by fifo impacts at the segment level  however  we experienced significant variability in our quarterly earnings in as these items were recognized 
earnings in the first two quarters of were significantly impacted as we consumed the majority of the higher cost steel but recognized only about half of the offsetting lifo benefit consistent with our historical practice of recording annual lifo impacts evenly throughout the year 
the remainder of the lifo benefit was recognized in the last half of  a period during which we experienced only minimal impact from higher cost steel 
for further discussion of inventories  see note a to the consolidated financial statements on page interest and income taxes net interest expense decreased million versus  primarily the result of lower commercial paper borrowings and lower interest rates in the consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for was higher  at  versus in this increase is primarily due to i tax adjustments resulting from 
table of contents part ii mexican tax law changes  and ii the lower level of earnings and mix among tax jurisdictions 
in  tax law changes in mexico caused us to re evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction 
as a result of our analysis  we recorded a million tax charge to earnings related to current and prior year losses that may expire before they can be utilized to reduce taxable earnings 
in  a tax benefit associated with the write off of an acquired company s stock was offset by increased reserves for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for certain foreign entities

during  sales from continuing operations decreased 
we reported full year net earnings from continuing operations of million  which included million of restructuring related charges  impairments  and other items 
our earnings reflected soft market demand which led to lower unit volume in many of our businesses 
in the majority of our markets  demand was soft throughout the year  but weakened appreciably late in the third quarter as consumers further reduced their spending in response to the financial market distress and general us and global economic conditions 
market share gains in certain businesses offset some of the impact from weak demand 
during the year  we also experienced significant inflation in steel costs  and we successfully implemented price increases to recover the majority of these higher costs

table of contents part ii sales from continuing operations decreased versus  primarily reflecting weak market demand and our decision to exit specific sales volume with unacceptable profit margins primarily in our store fixtures business 
these declines were partially offset by inflation related price increases and market share gains 
our us bedding components business gained market share in as a result of i bedding manufacturers shifting innerspring purchases from international to domestic sources  ii the deverticalization of a strong regional bedding manufacturer they now buy components from us that they previously produced for themselves  and  iii increased demand for innerspring mattresses  rather than premium priced  non innerspring products 
we experienced significant inflation in steel costs during  and in response  we implemented price increases to recover the higher costs 
the magnitude of our selling price increases varied by product line depending on steel content  but in our major residential and industrial businesses  prices increased substantially 
by late  steel costs began to decrease 
full year earnings from continuing operations were higher than in  primarily due to non recurrence of goodwill impairment charges related to our fixture display group million non recurrence of tax items million adjustments to valuation allowances related to potential foreign tax benefits lower interest expense several factors negatively impacted earnings

table of contents part ii the consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for was also lower  at versus in the rate was negatively impacted by goodwill impairment charges totaling million  of which million were non deductible 
this caused the rate as a percent of pre tax income to be much higher than normal 
in  a tax benefit associated with the write off of an acquired company s stock was offset by increased reserves for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for certain foreign entities 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million valuation allowance against certain foreign tax assets 
the valuation allowance related to our canadian automotive operations that produce lumbar supports 
in late  the automotive industry was in a dramatic state of decline  which reduced the demand for our components 
in addition to demand factors  these operations were also negatively impacted by the strength in recent years of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar our canadian automotive operations sell in us dollars while incurring labor and overhead costs in canadian dollars  thereby reducing margins 
as a result  we believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefit of deferred tax assets associated with these operations

table of contents part ii liquidity and capitalization in this section  we provide details  reflecting both continuing and discontinued operations  about our uses of cash cash from operations debt position and total capitalization we use cash for the following finance capital requirements eg productivity  growth and acquisitions pay dividends repurchase our stock our operations provide much of the cash we require  and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs 
in  cash proceeds from completed divestitures were an additional significant source of funds 
in  we generated our second highest level of cash from operations in our history  at million 
with less benefit from working capital reductions expected in  operating cash should approximate million  readily exceeding our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends 
we ended with net debt to net capital of  below our long term target and year end levels 
our long term target is to have net debt as a percent of net capital in the range 
page presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital at the end of the past two years 
uses of cash finance capital requirements improving returns of the existing asset base will continue to be a key focus 
however  cash is available to fund selective growth  both internally through capital expenditures and externally through acquisitions 
logo 
table of contents part ii capital expenditures include investments we make to modernize  maintain  and expand manufacturing capacity 
with our move to role based portfolio management  we are more restrictive in funding capital projects 
capital spending in is expected to be less than million 
growth capital  which had historically been available to all our businesses  is now predominantly earmarked for our grow business units 
operations designated as core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements  but expansion capital is limited 
we have also set a higher bar for acquisitions  and plan to pursue disciplined growth through fewer  but more strategic  opportunities 
we will seek acquisitions within our growth businesses  and will also look for longer term opportunities to enter new  higher growth markets that meet strict criteria 
as a result of the new acquisition criteria  no significant acquisitions were completed in or in  we acquired three businesses that were expected to add about million to annual revenue million in commercial fixturing components  million in industrial materials  and million in specialized products 
these businesses established a foothold in asian production of office chair controls manufactured coated wire products  including racks for dishwashers  and presented leggett with expanded technologies and cross segment selling opportunities broadened our suite of products for commercial vehicle interiors in addition to the initial cash outlays for acquisitions shown in the accompanying chart  we also assumed debt of million in we provide additional details about acquisitions in note r to the consolidated financial statements on page pay dividends logo with continued improvement in margins and returns  a decrease in capital spending and acquisitions  and the completion of most of the divestitures  we expect and have recently had more available cash to return to shareholders 
higher annual dividends are one means by which that will occur 
in late  we raised our quarterly dividend by  
table of contents part ii to 
per share 
in we modestly increased the quarterly dividend further  to 
per share  and extended to years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases  at an average compound growth rate of 
our targeted dividend payout is approximately of net earnings  but has been higher recently and will likely remain above targeted levels in the near term 
maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority 
we expect to spend approximately million on dividends in slightly less than in because of share repurchases 
cash from operations has been  and is expected to continue to be  sufficient to readily fund both capital expenditures and dividends 
repurchase stock logo share repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders 
during the past three years  we repurchased a total of million shares of our stock and reduced outstanding shares by about 
in  we repurchased approximately of shares outstanding at an average per share price of 
we expect to repurchase additional shares in  with the amount of purchases dependent on factors such as general economic conditions  level of demand in our end markets  and the availability of excess cash 
although no specific repurchase schedule has been established  we have been authorized by the board to repurchase up to million shares in 
table of contents part ii cash from operations cash from operations is our primary source of funds 
earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations 
logo in  cash from operations increased million versus primarily as a result of improving working capital trends 
accounts receivable while the dollar amount of accounts receivable has decreased primarily due to weak sales  our days of sales outstanding has increased as customers have slowed payments during the continued economic downturn 
we continue to focus on collection efforts to ensure customer accounts are paid on time 
inventory specific actions to reduce raw material purchases and production levels  along with price deflation  have resulted in a lower dollar amount of inventory 
however  the number of days of inventory on hand increased versus the prior year due to weak sales 
accounts payable we continue efforts to optimize payment terms with our vendors and as a result have seen an increase in both dollars of accounts payable and number of days of payables outstanding 
cash from operations in  though strong  was million lower than in primarily due to a smaller year over year decrease in working capital 
extremely weak market demand in the latter part of negatively impacted earnings 
working capital decreased in as a result of lower inventory and accounts receivable levels 
fourth quarter production cuts led to lower inventory levels versus the prior year 
accounts receivable also declined primarily due to extremely weak sales late in the year 

table of contents part ii the following table presents key working capital measures at the end of the past two years 
amount in millions days outstanding change change accounts receivable  net inventory  net accounts payable the accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as ending net accounts receivable net sales number of days in the year 
the inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as ending net inventory cost of goods sold number of days in the year 
the accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as ending accounts payable cost of goods sold number of days in the year 
working capital levels vary by segment 
the commercial fixturing components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the fixture display group 
this business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 

table of contents part ii capitalization this table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities equity total capitalization unused committed credit long term short term total unused committed credit current maturities of long term debt cash and cash equivalents ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x these calculations include current maturities  but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities 
equity decreased million in  primarily reflecting net share repurchases of million  dividends of million  and currency impacts of million 
fixed charges include interest expense  capitalized interest  plus implied interest included in operating leases 
earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes  plus fixed charges 
the next table shows the percent of long term debt to total capitalization at december  and  calculated in two ways long term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table 
long term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long term debt 
we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly 
we use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage 

table of contents part ii dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net capitalization long term debt to total capitalization net debt to net capitalization total debt which includes long term debt and current debt maturities decreased million in during the year  we reduced our commercial paper borrowings by million and paid off million of other long term debt that came due 
we can raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that terminates in based on the information currently available to us  we believe that the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the agreement 
at december   million of commercial paper was outstanding under this program and is classified as long term debt 
we also maintain an active shelf registration 
with anticipated operating cash flows  the commercial paper program and the active shelf registration  we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and fund future growth 
our commercial paper program continued to operate efficiently during the disruption of the global credit markets in late  those markets stabilized during changes in the credit markets and other events of the past year did not materially impact our weighted average effective borrowing rate for commercial paper 
if a disruption in the credit market was to become so severe that we were unable to issue commercial paper  we have the contractual right to draw funds directly on our revolving credit agreement 
in such event  the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowing 
the revolving credit agreement provides for the ability to issue letters of credit up to an aggregate million 
any utilization of these commitments for letters of credit reduces our commercial paper loan capacity by a corresponding amount 
at december   we had issued million of letters of credit under these commitments 
accordingly  at year end  an additional million was available to us under our commercial paper program million in total program million of outstanding commercial paper million of issued letters of credit 

table of contents part ii contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollar amounts in millions long term debt capitalized leases operating leases purchase obligations interest payments deferred income taxes other obligations including pensions and reserves for tax contingencies total contractual cash obligations the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due 
long term debt includes million of outstanding commercial paper  which is generally due overnight 
we have classified commercial paper as long term debt due in years since the commercial paper program is supported by a million revolving credit agreement which terminates in purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities 
interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at december  at rates in effect at the end of the year 
these totals include interest on the million of outstanding commercial paper discussed above 

table of contents part ii critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to do so  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and disclosures 
if we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change  and some of those changes could be significant 
our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management  at the time they are made  to be reasonable and appropriate 
estimates are adjusted for actual events  as they occur 
critical accounting estimates are those that are a subject to uncertainty and change  and b of material impact to our financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements 
we provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements on page description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of june and as triggering events occur 
in the past three years  no impairments have been recorded as a result of the annual impairment reviews 
as a result of the deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter  an interim goodwill impairment analysis was performed confirming that estimated fair value exceeded carrying values for all reporting units 
in the fourth quarter  we performed an interim goodwill impairment review as a result of the november strategic plan  and recorded goodwill impairment charges related to the fixture display reporting unit of million 
in order to assess goodwill for potential impairment  judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit which is one level below reportable segments using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit 
the cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance 
margins  sales levels  and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model 
fair market values for three of the reporting units exceeded book value by 
the goodwill associated with these reporting units is million 
these reporting units are dependent on the global automotive markets and the commercial and residential construction markets 
we expect future operating results to improve for all of these reporting units 
if actual performance does not improve and remains at current levels  future goodwill impairments could be possible 
the remaining reporting units including fixture display have fair market values that exceed carrying value by more than  and have goodwill of million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill cont 
additional goodwill impairments were recorded in   and related to assets held for sale as discussed below 
the market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio 
ratios are derived from comparable publicly traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit 
information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in note c on page assets held for sale assets held for sale are carried at the lower of historical cost or net realizable value fair market value less cost to sell 
we review and update our estimates of net realizable value on a quarterly basis 
as a result of the strategic plan  goodwill and other long lived asset impairments of million related to businesses targeted for divestiture were recorded in the fourth quarter of in discontinued operations 
throughout and  we recorded additional impairments of million and million  respectively in discontinued operations  as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell became more certain 
fair market value for assets held for sale contains uncertainties surrounding the expected proceeds from the ultimate sale of the business or asset 
this value is usually determined using offers received for these businesses prior to sale  or earnings multiples in the current market 
for individual assets closed facilities  etc 
periodic appraisals are performed to determine fair market value 
we could incur additional write downs in the future if our estimates of fair value less costs to sell prove inaccurate  or if further assets or businesses are targeted for divestiture 
other long lived assets other long lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairments of other long lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place  or we decide to discontinue product lines completely 
these impairments are very unpredictable  and are difficult to anticipate 
impairments were million in  million in  and million in 
table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions other long lived assets cont 
for other long lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured usually at a branch level 
our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets 
for assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value  fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets 
as a result of the circumstances that caused us to record a million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of a canadian automotive facility in the fourth quarter  we tested the carrying value of this entity for recoverability and concluded that no impairments were indicated 
in  we monitored cash flows generated by this entity and again concluded that cash flows are sufficient to recover the current carrying value of million as of december  we believe that future restructuring and shut down activities should be equal to or less than those in  however this could change if certain product lines or businesses do not meet return expectations 
this could cause us to decide to exit a business which could trigger long lived asset impairment 
inventory reserves in determining the value of inventories  we reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
if we have had no sales of a given product for months  those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely 
if we have more than a one year s supply of a product  we value that inventory at net realizable value what we think we will recover 
our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow moving ie not selling very quickly 
changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving 
at december   we had recorded an inventory reserve of million approximately of fifo inventories to account for obsolete inventories 
additions to inventory reserves have averaged million in each of the past three years 
approximately two thirds of historical write downs relate to the commercial fixturing components and specialized products segments due to the custom nature of their products 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory reserves cont 
the calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience on average 
we are implementing new inventory optimization processes that should reduce the impact of write downs in the future 
we do not expect any significant changes in customer or industry trends that would increase the exposure to inventory obsolescence 
workers compensation we are substantially self insured for costs related to workers compensation  which requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation 
our estimates of self insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay since we are self insured 
we consider a number of factors  including historical claim experience  demographic factors  and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers 
over the past five years  we have incurred  on average  million annually for costs associated with workers compensation 
average year to year variation over the past five years has been approximately million 
at december   we had accrued million to cover future self insurance liabilities 
internal safety statistics indicate improving safety trends in the last two years 
usually  safety statistics are leading indicators of exposure trends 
as a result of headcount reductions and improved safety trends  we expect worker compensation costs to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future 
credit losses for accounts and notes receivable  we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible 
when we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay  we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible 
our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  industry and macroeconomic considerations  and historical loss experience 
a significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions credit losses cont 
our customers are diverse and many are small to medium sized companies  with some being highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning 
the average annual amount of customer related credit losses was million less than of annual net sales over the last three years 
at december   our reserves for doubtful accounts not held for sale totaled million about of our accounts and notes receivable of million 
weak market demand has intensified pressure on highly leveraged customers in some of our industries 
in each of and  we experienced bad debt expense that was approximately million higher than pre levels 
we expect a return to more normal levels  however if weak market demand persists  other bankruptcies could be possible 
we also recognized an million loss in related to the aluminum divestiture note 
at december   we had million of notes outstanding  primarily related to divested businesses  and have concluded that no reserve is required for these notes 
pension accounting for our pension plans  we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and the current value of those benefit obligations 
the pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid  which also impacts current year pension expense 
the discount rates used to calculate the pension liability and pension expense has remained consistent at approximately for the last three years 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 
million and decrease the plans funded status by approximately million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions pension accounting cont 
determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held bonds and equities 
other assumptions include rates of compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates  and retirement ages 
these estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations 
the expected return on assets decreased in to  from a rate in of  and in the reduction in the rate was primarily driven by a change in asset allocation toward more conservative investments ie 
bonds 
a basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by 
million  but have no effect on the plans funded status 
assuming a long term investment horizon  we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions  even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time 
these estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements 
subsequent to year end  we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns 
tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions  including among other things the timing and amounts of deductions  and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain 
our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions 
our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws  the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction  and the results of current tax audits and assessments 
potential changes in tax laws under the new administration could impact assumptions related to the non repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
if all non repatriated earnings were taxed  we would incur additional taxes of approximately million 
the recovery of net operating losses nol s has been closely evaluated for the likelihood of recovery based upon factors such as the age of losses  viable tax planning strategies  and future taxable earnings expectations 
we believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary 
however  if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required  we could incur additional tax expense 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes cont 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount  source  and timing of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a probability of being realized 
in addition  assumptions have been made regarding the non repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries 
those assumptions may change in the future  thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation 
tax audits by various taxing authorities are expected to increase as governments continue to look for ways to raise additional revenue 
based upon past experience  we do not expect any major changes to our tax liability as a result of this increased audit activity  however  we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience 
contingencies we evaluate various legal  environmental  and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate 
if it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred  we accrue a liability for the estimate of the ultimate loss 
our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost 
our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
the largest claim against us is the gray v 
derderian case  which is discussed below 
we have agreed to a settlement with the plaintiff group  and have insurance coverage in excess of the settlement amount of million 
the only contingencies remaining are court approval and ultimate payment by our insurance carrier 
in the highly unlikely event that our insurance carrier goes bankrupt prior to payment  we believe there are sufficient reserves statutorily required to cover the million settlement 
we also have several environmental clean up activities related to current and closed facilities that mostly involve soil and groundwater contamination 
based upon facts available at this time  we believe reserves are adequate  however cost estimates could change as we determine more about the severity and cost of remediation 

table of contents part ii contingencies our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost 
our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
on july   we were named as one of approximately defendants in several cases consolidated as gray v 
derderian  case no 
cv l  usdc usdc this litigation resulted from a nightclub fire in west warwick  rhode island involving multiple deaths and injuries 
there are in excess of plaintiffs in the litigation 
along with other foam manufacturing defendants  leggett is alleged to have manufactured and sold bulk polyurethane foam to a foam fabricator in rhode island  who in turn  is alleged to have fabricated and sold foam sheets to the nightclub 
the foam was among other materials alleged to have caught fire when pyrotechnics were ignited inside the nightclub 
we believe we did not manufacture the foam subject to the lawsuit and that we have valid defenses to the claims 
nevertheless  with our consent  our primary insurance carrier reached a tentative settlement with counsel for all plaintiffs on april  and we executed the final settlement agreement on october  the settlement agreement is subject to various court approvals and the signature of all plaintiffs 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we would pay a million self insured retention 
the remainder of the million settlement would be paid by our insurance carrier 
we do not believe the settlement or the outcome will have a material effect on leggett s financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations 
we recorded million of expense in and currently have a million receivable from the insurance carrier and an million liability related to this matter  that is included in current assets and current liabilities  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheets 
new accounting standards we adopted new accounting guidance in as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements on page the financial accounting standards board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods that we have not yet adopted  but we do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements

substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in united states dollars 
the fair value of fixed rate debt was less than its carrying value by at december   and less than its carrying value by at december  the increase in the fair market value of the company s debt is primarily due to the decrease in credit spreads over risk free rates as compared to the prior year end 
the fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a bloomberg secondary market rate  as of december  for similar remaining maturities  plus an estimated spread over such treasury securities representing the company s interest costs under its medium term note program
