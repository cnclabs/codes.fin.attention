concurrently  interest earning asset yields  which are often tied to longer term interest rates  continued to decline 
by the end of  however  the pace of further declines in interest earning asset yields had slowed significantly

net interest revenue net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources 
net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies 
the company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and  conversely  a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall ie  interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities 
when interest rates fall  the company attempts to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest bearing liabilities 
since the company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients  as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients  and also controls the composition of its investment securities  it has some ability to manage its net interest spread 
however  the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition
