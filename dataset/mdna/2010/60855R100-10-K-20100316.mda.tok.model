this resulted in additional interest expense of million per diluted share for the year ended december   and million per diluted share for the year ended december  overview molina healthcare  inc is a multi state managed care organization that arranges for the delivery of health care services to persons eligible for medicaid  medicare  and other government sponsored programs for low income families and individuals 
we conduct our business primarily through licensed health plans in the states of california  florida  michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
effective december   we terminated operations at our small medicare health plan in nevada 
the health plans are locally operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states  each of which is licensed as a health maintenance organization  or hmo 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the health information management  or him  business of unisys corporation 
the him business provides design  development  implementation  and business process outsourcing solutions to state governments for their medicaid management information systems  or mmis  a core tool used to support the administration of state medicaid and other health care entitlement programs 
the him business currently holds mmis contracts with the states of idaho  louisiana  maine  new jersey  and west virginia  as well as a contract to provide drug rebate administration services for the florida medicaid program 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of we intend to operate the him business under the name  molina medicaid solutions 
our financial performance for   and is briefly summarized below dollars in thousands  except per share data year ended december  earnings per diluted share premium revenue operating income net income medical care ratio g a expenses as a percentage of total revenue total ending membership revenue premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and  except as described below  is not generally subject to significant accounting estimates 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue as a fixed amount per member per month  or pmpm  pursuant to our medicaid contracts with state agencies  our medicare contracts with cms  and our contracts with other managed care organizations for which we operate as a subcontractor 
these premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services 
the state medicaid programs and the federal medicare program periodically adjust premium rates 
the amount of the premiums paid to us may vary substantially between states and among various government programs 
pmpm premiums for chip members of the are generally among our lowest  with rates as low as 
table of contents approximately pmpm in california 
premium revenues for medicaid members are generally higher 
among the tanf medicaid population the medicaid group that includes mostly mothers and children pmpm premiums range between approximately in california to over in ohio 
among our medicaid abd membership  pmpm premiums range from approximately in utah to over  in ohio 
contributing to the variability in medicaid rates among the states is the practice of some states to exclude certain benefits from the managed care contract most often pharmacy and catastrophic case benefits and retain responsibility for those benefits at the state level 
medicare premiums are almost  pmpm  with medicare revenue totaling million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue in the form of birth income a one time payment for the delivery of a child from the medicaid programs in california effective october   michigan  missouri  ohio  texas  utah effective september   and washington 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 
approximately of our premium revenue for the year ended december  was realized under a medicaid cost plus reimbursement agreement with the state of utah that ended effective august  effective september   the utah health plan s contract with the state of utah became a prepaid capitation contract  under which the plan is now paid a fixed pmpm amount  as in the other states in which we operate 
certain components of premium revenue are subject to accounting estimates 
chief among these are florida health plan medical cost floor minimum for behavioral health 
a portion of premium revenue paid to our florida health plan by the state of florida may be refunded to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined behavioral health care costs 
at december   we had not recorded any liability under the terms of this contract provision 
if the state of florida disagrees with our interpretation of the existing contract terms  an adjustment to the amounts owed may be required 
any changes to the terms of this provision  including revisions to the definitions of premium revenue or behavioral health care costs  the period of time over which performance is measured or the manner of its measurement  or the percentages used in the calculations  may affect the profitability of our florida health plan 
new mexico health plan medical cost floors minimums and administrative cost and profit ceilings maximums a portion of premium revenue paid to our new mexico health plan by the state of new mexico may be refunded to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs  or if administrative costs or profit as defined exceed certain amounts 
our contract with the state of new mexico requires that we spend a minimum percentage of premium revenue on certain explicitly defined medical care costs the medical cost floor 
our contract is for a three year period  and the medical cost floor is based on premiums and medical care costs over the entire contract period 
effective july   our new mexico health plan entered into a new three year contract that  in addition to retaining the medical cost floor  added certain limits on the amount our new mexico health plan can a expend on administrative costs  and b retain as profit 
at december   we had not recorded any liability under the terms of these contract provisions 
if the state of new mexico disagrees with our interpretation of the existing contract terms  an adjustment to the amounts owed may be required 
any changes to the terms of these provisions  including revisions to the definitions of premium revenue  medical care costs  administrative costs or profit  the period of time over which performance is measured or the manner of its measurement  or the percentages used in the calculations  may affect the profitability of our new mexico health plan 
new mexico health plan at risk premium revenue under our contract with the state of new mexico  up to of our new mexico health plan s revenue may be refundable to the state if certain performance measures are not met 
these performance measures are generally linked to various quality of care and administrative measures dictated by the state 
through december   our new mexico health plan had received million in at risk revenue for state fiscal year and the first half of state fiscal year combined 
we have recognized million of that amount as revenue through december   and recorded a liability of approximately million for the remainder 
ohio health plan at risk premium revenue under our contract with the state of ohio  up to of our ohio health plan s revenue may be refundable to the state if certain performance measures are not met 
these performance measures are generally linked to various quality of care measures dictated by the state 
through december   our ohio health plan had received million in at risk revenue for state fiscal year 
table of contents and the first half of state fiscal year combined 
we have recognized million of that amount as revenue through december  and recorded a liability of approximately million for the remainder 
utah health plan premium revenue our utah health plan may be entitled to receive additional premium revenue from the state of utah as an incentive payment for saving the state of utah money in relation to fee for service medicaid 
in prior years  we estimated amounts we believed were recoverable under our savings sharing agreement with the state of utah based on available information and our interpretation of our contract with the state 
the state may not agree with our interpretation or our application of the contract language  and it may also not agree with the manner in which we have processed and analyzed our member claims and encounter records 
thus  the ultimate amount of savings sharing revenue that we realize from prior years may be subject to negotiation with the state 
during  as a result of an ongoing disagreement with the state of utah  we wrote off the entire receivable  totaling million 
our utah health plan continues to assert its claim to the amounts believed to be due under the savings share agreement 
when additional information is known  or resolution is reached with the state regarding the appropriate savings sharing payment amount for prior years  we will adjust the amount of savings sharing revenue recorded in our financial statements as appropriate in light of such new information or agreement 
no receivables for saving sharing revenue have been established at december  and texas health plan premium revenue the contract entered into between our texas health plan and the state of texas includes a profit sharing agreement  where we pay a rebate to the state of texas if our texas health plan generates pretax income above a certain specified percentage  as determined in accordance with a tiered rebate schedule 
we are limited in the amount of administrative costs that we may deduct in calculating the rebate  if any 
as of december   we had an aggregate liability of approximately million accrued pursuant to our profit sharing agreement with the state of texas for the and contract years ending august of each year 
during  we paid the state of texas million relating to the and contract years  and the contract year is now closed 
because the final settlement calculations include a claims run out period of nearly one year  the amounts recorded  based on our estimates  may be adjusted 
we believe that the ultimate settlement will not differ materially from our estimates 
texas health plan at risk premium revenue under our contract with the state of texas  up to of our texas health plan s revenue may be refundable to the state if certain performance measures are not met 
these performance measures are generally linked to various quality of care measures dictated by the state 
through december   our texas health plan had received million in at risk revenue for state fiscal year and the first half of state fiscal year combined 
we have recognized million of that amount as revenue through december   and recorded a liability of approximately million for the remainder 
medicare premium revenue based on member encounter data that we submit to cms  our medicare revenue is subject to retroactive adjustment for both member risk scores and member pharmacy cost experience for up to two years after the original year of service 
this adjustment takes into account the acuity of each member s medical needs relative to what was anticipated when premiums were originally set for that member 
in the event that a member requires less acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may recover premium from us 
in the event that a member requires more acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may pay us additional retroactive premium 
a similar retroactive reconciliation is undertaken by cms for our medicare members pharmacy utilization 
that analysis is similar to the process for the adjustment of member risk scores  but is further complicated by member pharmacy cost sharing provisions attached to the medicare pharmacy benefit that do not apply to the services measured by the member risk adjustment process 
we estimate the amount of medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members heath care utilization patterns and cms practices 
to the extent that the premium revenue ultimately received from cms differs from recorded amounts  we will adjust reported medicare revenue 
based upon our knowledge of member health care utilization patterns we have recorded a liability of approximately million related to the potential recoupment of medicare premium revenue at december  
table of contents historically  membership growth has been the primary reason for our increasing annual premium revenues  although more recently our revenues have also grown due to the more care intensive benefits and related higher premiums associated with our abd and medicare members

our results of operations are impacted by our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health care services and to accurately estimate costs incurred 
expenses related to medical care services are captured in the following four categories fee for service physician providers paid on a fee for service basis are paid according to a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with the providers 
we pay hospitals on a fee for service basis in a variety of ways  including by per diem amounts  by diagnostic related groups  or drgs  as a percentage of billed charges  and by case rates 
we also pay a small portion of hospitals on a capitated basis 
we also have stop loss agreements with the hospitals with which we contract  under certain circumstances  we pay escalated charges in connection with these stop loss agreements 
under all fee for service arrangements  we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided 
expenses related to fee for service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed 
the costs of drugs administered in a physician or hospital setting that are not billed through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs 
capitation many of our primary care physicians and a small portion of our specialists and hospitals are paid on a capitated basis 
under capitation contracts  we typically pay a fixed pmpm payment to the provider without regard to the frequency  extent  or nature of the medical services actually furnished 
under capitated contracts  we remain liable for the provision of certain health care services 
certain of our capitated contracts also contain incentive programs based on service delivery  quality of care  utilization management  and other criteria 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
the financial risk for pharmacy services for a small portion of our membership is delegated to capitated providers 
pharmacy pharmacy costs include all drug  injectibles  and immunization costs paid through our pharmacy benefit managers 
as noted above  drugs and injectibles not paid through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs  except in those limited instances where we capitate drug and injectible costs 
other other medical care costs include medically related administrative costs  certain provider incentive costs  reinsurance costs  and other health care expense 
medically related administrative costs include  for example  expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  hour on call nurses  and a portion of our information technology costs

absent this revenue adjustment  the new mexico health plan s medical care ratio would have been for the year ended december  as of december   our nevada health plan no longer served members 
premium revenue and medical care costs for the nevada health plan have been included in other 
other medical care costs also include medically related administrative costs at the parent company 
note estimates of utilization and unit costs may not match changes in reported costs due to the impact of shifts in case mix between the periods presented  prior period development  the existence of pass through contracts in which third parties assume medical risk  and other factors 
additionally  estimates of utilization for the year ended december   exclude the month of december due to the substantial incompleteness of claims payment data for that month 
operating results for the year ended december   were most significantly impacted by the following higher utilization due to widespread influenza related illness across the company s health plans 
margin compression related to state budget shortfalls 
enrollment growth and the higher costs associated with new members 
higher emergency room costs 
net income for the year ended december   net income decreased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  premium revenue premium revenue grew approximately in the year ended december  compared with the same period in during  membership grew overall  with florida  california  washington  and ohio gaining the most members 
consolidated premium revenue increased on a pmpm basis 
increased membership contributed of the growth in premium revenue  and increases in pmpm revenue  as a result of both rate changes and shifts in member mix  contributed the remaining 
we received pmpm premium reductions in that were in many cases correlated with reductions in the medicaid fee schedule that also reduced our medical costs 
however  pmpm premium reductions in washington and missouri in were not fully commensurate with changes in the medicaid fee schedule in those states  and 
table of contents thus decreases in premiums were not matched by lower medical costs 
in washington  premium reductions not linked to decreases in the medicaid fee schedule lowered our medical margin by approximately million in in missouri  the retention of the pharmacy benefit by the state effective october  reduced our medical margin by approximately million in investment income investment income for decreased million to million  from million earned in this decline was due to lower interest rates in medical care costs medical care costs  in the aggregate  increased on a pmpm basis for the year ended december  compared with the same period in the medical care ratio was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in increased expenses were generally the result of higher utilization rather than higher unit costs except in the case of outpatient costs  where both utilization and unit costs increased and were most pronounced in connection with physician and outpatient emergency room facility services 
influenza related illnesses and the costs associated with more recently enrolled members were key factors in the higher utilization 
we estimate that the incremental costs associated with influenza related illnesses were approximately million  or per diluted share  in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  physician and outpatient costs exhibited the most significant unfavorable cost trend in the year ended december  together  these costs increased approximately on a pmpm basis compared with the same period in consistent with our experience throughout  emergency room utilization up approximately and cost per visit up approximately were the primary drivers of increased cost in the year ended december  hospitals have billed us for more intensive levels of care than in the same period in for outpatient emergency room facility services 
the billing codes for emergency room level of care with level reflecting the least intensive care and level reflecting the most intensive care changed significantly in the year ended december   compared with the same period in level and level visits decreased by and  respectively  while level  level  and level visits increased by   and  respectively 
inpatient costs were flat on a pmpm basis year over year despite increased utilization 
pharmacy costs including the benefit of rebates increased on a pmpm basis year over year  excluding the missouri health plan  where the pharmacy benefit was retained by the state of missouri effective october  pharmacy utilization increased approximately year over year  while unit costs excluding rebates were flat 
capitated costs increased approximately pmpm year over year  primarily as a result of rate increases received for members capitated on a percentage of premium basis at the new mexico health plan  and the transition of members into capitated arrangements in california

we initially announced our intention to purchase netpass in august netpass was a provider of care management and administrative services at that time to approximately  florida medipass members in south and central florida florida medipass is the state of florida s medicaid program 
our wholly owned subsidiary  molina healthcare of florida  inc  was awarded a medicaid managed care contract by the state of florida in october subsequently  netpass members have been notified of our intention to acquire netpass and  beginning in december  offered membership with our florida health plan on a county by county basis

the florida health plan receives fixed pmpm payments from the state of florida for the care of these members  and the florida health plan is at risk for the cost of the members medical care 
as of december   we have transitioned approximately  netpass members to our florida health plan  and have recorded million of goodwill and intangible assets relating to these members 
of this amount  we have paid the sellers million  with the balance accrued to accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the million current liability includes a indemnification hold back totaling million  as provided in the purchase agreement  and a million payable to the sellers for membership transitioned to date as of december  because the final membership reconciliation will take place early in the second quarter of  the provisional measurements of goodwill and intangible assets are subject to change 
liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments  and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility 
we forecast  analyze  and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue and investment income 
such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity 
thus  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
we generally receive premium revenue in advance of the payment of claims for the related health care services 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
these investments are made pursuant to board approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital  and maximize total return on invested assets  all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest 
these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of ten years or less excluding auction rate securities and variable rate securities  for which interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be four years or less 
professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments 
as of december   a substantial portion of our cash was invested in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities  and our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities 
our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
all of our investments are classified as current assets  except for our investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as non current assets 
the average annualized portfolio yields for the years ended december    and were approximately   and  respectively 

table of contents investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our restricted investments until maturity and  as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid to our non regulated parent company in the form of dividends  when and as permitted by applicable regulations  for general corporate use

ebitda year ended december  in thousands operating income add back depreciation and amortization expense ebitda we calculate ebitda by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to operating income 
operating income included interest income of million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
ebitda is not prepared in conformity with gaap since it excludes depreciation and amortization expense  as well as interest expense  and the provision for income taxes 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  operating margin  or cash provided by operating activities 
management uses ebitda as a supplemental metric in evaluating our financial performance  in evaluating financing and business development decisions  and in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
for these reasons  management believes that ebitda is a useful supplemental measure to investors in evaluating our performance and the performance of other companies in our industry

in march  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional million in aggregate of either our common stock or our convertible senior notes 
the purchase program was funded with working capital 

table of contents under the purchase program  we purchased approximately  shares of common stock for million average cost of approximately per share in the second quarter of we did not purchase any shares in the third or fourth quarters of this purchase program terminated december  capital resources at december   the parent company molina healthcare  inc held cash and investments of approximately million  including million in non current auction rate securities  compared with million of cash and investments at december  on a consolidated basis  at december   we had working capital of million compared with million at december  at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively 
at december   investments were million  including million in non current auction rate securities  and at december   investments were million  including million in non current auction rate securities 
we intend to use a draw on our credit facility  which currently has no outstanding balance  to fund all or a substantial portion of the million purchase price of the him business 
subject to the following discussion regarding our credit facility and its use to acquire the him business of unisys corporation  we believe that our cash resources and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations  regulatory requirements  and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
credit facility in  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of march   among molina healthcare inc  certain lenders  and bank of america na  as administrative agent the credit facility 
effective may  we entered into a third amendment of the credit facility that increased the size of the revolving line of credit from million to million  maturing in may the credit facility is intended to be used for general corporate purposes 
pending the closing of the acquisition of the him business as discussed below  interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility are based  at our election  on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  or the base rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate equals the higher of bank of america s prime rate or above the federal funds rate 
we also pay a commitment fee on the total unused commitments of the lenders under the credit facility 
the applicable margins and commitment fee are based on our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
the applicable margins range between and for libor loans and between and for base rate loans 
the commitment fee ranges between and 
in addition  we are required to pay a fee for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility equal to the applicable margin for libor loans and a customary fronting fee 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of the capital stock of our health plan subsidiaries with the exception of the california health plan 
the credit facility includes usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including covenants limiting liens  mergers  asset sales  other fundamental changes  debt  acquisitions  dividends and other distributions  capital expenditures  investments  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated ebitda of not more than to at any time 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility 
subject to the closing of the him acquisition as described above under the heading  acquisitions  in november we agreed to enter into a fourth amendment to the credit facility 
the fourth amendment will become effective upon the closing of the acquisition of the him business 
the fourth amendment is required because the million purchase price for the him business exceeds the currently applicable deal size threshold under the terms of the credit facility 
pursuant to the fourth amendment  the lenders have consented to our acquisition of the him business 
upon its effectiveness at the closing  the fourth amendment would increase the commitment fee on the total unused commitments of the lenders under the facility to basis points on all levels of the pricing grid  with the pricing grid referring to our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda 
the pricing for libor 
table of contents loans and base rate loans would be raised by basis points at every level of the pricing grid 
the applicable margins would thus range between and for libor loans  and between and for base rate loans 
until the delivery of a compliance certificate with respect to our financial statements for the quarter ending after the him business acquisition closes  the applicable margin shall be fixed at for libor loans and for base rate loans 
in connection with the lenders approval of the fourth amendment  a consent fee of basis points was paid on the amount of each consenting lender s commitment 
in addition  the fourth amendment would carve out from our indebtedness and restricted payment covenants under the credit facility the million current principal amount of the notes although the million indebtedness would still be included in the calculation of our consolidated leverage ratio  increase the amount of surety bond obligations we may incur  increase our allowable capital expenditures  and reduce the fixed charge coverage ratio from x to x on a pro forma basis at december   and x thereafter 
on march   we agreed to enter into a fifth amendment to the credit facility 
the fifth amendment will also become effective upon the closing of the acquisition of the him business 
the fifth amendment is required because  after giving effect to the acquisition of the him business on a pro forma basis  and inclusive of the company s fourth quarter ebitda of only million  the company s consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters would exceed the currently applicable ratio of to the fifth amendment will increase the maximum consolidated leverage ratio under the credit facility to to for the fourth quarter of on a pro forma basis  and to to for the first  second  and third quarters of  excluding the single date of september  on september   the maximum consolidated leverage ratio shall revert back to to however  if the company has actually reduced its consolidated leverage ratio to no more than to on or before august   the consolidated leverage ratio under the credit facility will revert back to to on august  on the date that the consolidated leverage ratio reverts to to whether august  or september  the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the credit facility shall be reduced on a pro rata basis from million to million 
in connection with the lenders approval of the fifth amendment  we will pay an amendment fee of basis points on the amount of each consenting lender s commitment 
we will also pay an incremental commitment fee of basis points based on each lender s unfunded commitment during the period from the effective date of the fifth amendment through the date that the maximum consolidated leverage ratio is reduced to to  plus a potential duration fee of basis points payable on august  in the event that the consolidated leverage ratio has not been reduced to to by august  shelf registration statement in december  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec covering the issuance of up to million of our securities  including common stock  warrants  or debt securities  and up to  shares of outstanding common stock that may be sold from time to time by the molina siblings trust as a selling stockholder 
we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
long term debt convertible senior notes in october  we sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
the sale of the notes resulted in net proceeds totaling million 
during  we purchased and retired million face amount of the notes  for a remaining aggregate principal amount of million as of december  the notes rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are convertible into cash and  under certain circumstances  shares of our common stock 
the initial conversion rate is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the notes 
this represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
in addition  if certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control occur prior to maturity  we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances 
prior to july  holders may convert their notes only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter after our fiscal quarter ending december   if the closing sale price per share of our common stock  for each of at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading 
table of contents days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter  is greater than or equal to of the conversion price per share of our common stock  during the five business day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of the notes for each trading day of such period was less than of the product of the closing price per share of our common stock on such day and the conversion rate in effect on such day  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions or other specified events 
on or after july   holders may convert their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions is satisfied 
we will deliver cash and shares of our common stock  if any  upon conversion of each  principal amount of notes  as follows an amount in cash the principal return equal to the sum of  for each of the volume weighted average price  or vwap  trading days during the conversion period  the lesser of the daily conversion value for such vwap trading day and representing th of  and a number of shares based upon  for each of the vwap trading days during the conversion period  any excess of the daily conversion value above regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our principal operations are conducted through our health plan subsidiaries operating in california  florida  michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
the health plans are subject to state laws that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and may restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to molina healthcare  inc as the sole stockholder of each of our health plans 
to the extent the subsidiaries must comply with these regulations  they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us 
the net assets in these subsidiaries  after intercompany eliminations  which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  advances  or cash dividends totaled million at december   and million at december  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  adopted rules effective december   which  if adopted by a particular state  set minimum capitalization requirements for health plans and other insurance entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital  or rbc  rules 
these rules  which vary slightly from state to state  have been adopted in michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
california and florida have not adopted rbc rules and have not given notice of any intention to do so 
the rbc rules  if adopted by california and florida  may increase the minimum capital required by those states 
at december   our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared to the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
all of our health plans were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements at december  we have the ability and commitment to provide additional working capital to each of our health plans when necessary to ensure that capital and surplus continue to meet regulatory requirements 
barring any change in regulatory requirements  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements through critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include those areas listed below 
the most significant of these estimates is the determination of medical claims and benefits payable  which is discussed in further detail below the determination of medical claims and benefits payable  
table of contents the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized under certain contracts that place revenue at risk dependent upon either the achievement of certain quality or administrative measurements  or the expenditure of certain percentages of revenue on defined expenses  the determination of allowances for uncollectible accounts  the valuation of certain investments  settlements under risk or savings sharing programs  the impairment of long lived and intangible assets  the determination of professional and general liability claims  and reserves for potential absorption of claims unpaid by insolvent providers  the determination of reserves for the outcome of litigation  the determination of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  and the determination of unrecognized tax benefits 
medical claims and benefits payable the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations in any given period 
such determination of our liability requires the application of a significant degree of judgment by our management 
as a result  the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date  as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
such medical care cost liabilities include  among other items  unpaid fee for service claims  capitation payments owed to providers  unpaid pharmacy invoices  and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid 
we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 
the most important element in estimating our medical care costs is our estimate for fee for service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us 
these fee for service costs that have been incurred but have not been paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not paid  or ibnp 
our ibnp claims reserve  as reported in our balance sheet  represents our best estimate of the total amount of claims we will ultimately pay with respect to claims that we have incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we estimate our ibnp monthly using actuarial methods based on a number of factors 
our estimated ibnp liability represented million of our total medical claims and benefits payable of million as of december  excluding amounts related to the run out of our cost plus medicaid contract in utah which contract was replaced with a prepaid capitation contract effective september  and amounts that we anticipate paying on behalf of a capitated provider in ohio which we will subsequently withhold from that provider s monthly capitation payment  our ibnp liability at december  was million 
the factors we consider when estimating our ibnp include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our assessment of these factors is then translated into an estimate of our ibnp liability at the relevant measuring point through the calculation of a base estimate of ibnp  a further reserve for adverse claims development  and an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the base estimate of ibnp is derived through application of claims payment completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates 
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based on actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date  based on historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding 
table of contents december   by the percentages indicated 
a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in increase decrease in estimated medical claims and completion factors benefits payable for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the delay between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service  we estimate our claims liability based on trended pmpm cost estimates 
these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated 
an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in decrease increase in trended per member per month medical claims and cost estimates benefits payable the following per share amounts are based on a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of  and million diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december  assuming a hypothetical change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 
assuming a hypothetical change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 
the corresponding figures for a change in completion factors and pmpm cost estimates would be million  or per diluted share  net of tax  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
it is important to note that any change in the estimate of either completion factors or trended pmpm costs would usually be accompanied by a change in the estimate of the other component  and that a change in one component would almost always compound rather than offset the resulting distortion to net income 
when completion factors are overestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be underestimated 
both circumstances will create an overstatement of net income 
likewise  when completion factors are underestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be overestimated  creating an understatement of net income 
in other words  errors in estimates involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will usually act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and medical care costs in the same direction 
for example  if completion factors were overestimated by  resulting in an overstatement of net income by approximately million  it is likely that trended pmpm costs would be underestimated  resulting in an additional overstatement of net income 
after we have established our base ibnp reserve through the application of completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates  we then compute an additional liability  also using actuarial techniques  to account for adverse developments in our claims payments which the base actuarial model is not intended to and does not account for 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for adverse claims development 
the provision for adverse claims 
table of contents development is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnp 
it is intended to capture the potential inadequacy of our ibnp estimate as a result of our inability to adequately assess the impact of factors such as changes in the speed of claims receipt and payment  the relative magnitude or severity of claims  known outbreaks of disease such as influenza  our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind or disabled abd  changes to state controlled fee schedules upon which much of our provider payments are based  modifications and upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices  and increasing medical costs 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnp after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for adverse claims development 
we also include in our ibnp liability an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the development of ibnp is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims payment information becomes available 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish ibnp 
on a monthly basis  we review and update our estimated ibnp liability and the methods used to determine that liability 
any adjustments are reflected in the period known 
while we believe our current estimates are adequate  we have in the past been required to increase significantly our claims reserves for periods previously reported  and may be required to do so again in the future 
any significant increases to prior period claims reserves would materially decrease reported earnings for the period in which the adjustment is made 
in our judgment  the estimates for completion factors will likely prove to be more accurate than trended pmpm cost estimates because estimated completion factors are subject to fewer variables in their determination 
completion factors are developed over long periods of time  and are most likely to be affected by changes in claims receipt and payment experience and by provider billing practices 
trended pmpm cost estimates  while affected by the same factors  will also be influenced by health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
as discussed above  however  errors in estimates involving trended pmpm costs will almost always be accompanied by errors in estimates involving completion factors  and vice versa 
in such circumstances  errors in estimation involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and therefore medical care costs in the same direction 
assuming that base reserves have been accurately estimated  we would expect that amounts ultimately paid would be between and less than the liability recorded at the end of the period as a result of the inclusion in that liability of the allowance for adverse claims development and the accrued cost of settling those claims 
however  there can be no assurance that amounts ultimately paid out will not be higher or lower than this to range  as shown by our results in and when the amounts ultimately paid out were less than the amount of the reserves we had established as of the beginning of those years by approximately and  respectively 
as shown in greater detail in the table below  the amounts ultimately paid out on our liabilities in fiscal years and were less than what we had expected when we had established our reserves 
while the specific reasons for the overestimation of our liabilities were different in each of the two years  in general the overestimations were tied to our assessment of specific circumstances at our individual health plans which were unique to those reporting periods 
for the year ended december   we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million see table below 
this was primarily caused by the overestimation of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable at december  the overestimation of claims liability at december  was the result of the following factors in michigan  we underestimated the impact of a steep drop in claims inventory during december  thereby overestimating our liability at december  in new mexico  we overestimated the ultimate amounts we would need to pay to resolve certain high dollar provider claims  thereby overestimating our liability at december  in ohio  we underestimated the degree to which certain operational initiatives had reduced our medical costs in the last few months of  thereby overestimating our liability at december  
table of contents in washington  we overestimated the impact that certain adverse utilization trends would have on our liability at december   thereby overestimating our liability at december  in california  we underestimated utilization trends at the end of  leading to an underestimation of our liability at december  additionally  we underestimated the impact that certain delays in the receipt of paper claims as opposed to electronically submitted claims would have on our liability  leading to a further underestimation of our liability at december  for the year ended december   we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million see table below 
this was primarily caused by the overestimation of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable at december  the overestimation of claims liability at december  was the result of the following factors in michigan  we had overestimated the extent to which both catastrophic claims and state mandated changes to the methodology used to pay outpatient claims had increased our liability at december  in washington  we had overestimated the extent to which state mandated changes to hospital fee schedules implemented in august had increased our liability at december  in estimating our claims liability at december   we adjusted our base calculation to take account of the following factors which we believe are reasonably likely to change our final claims liability amount the rapid growth of membership across nearly all of our health plans in fiscal year  particularly the growth in membership at our florida health plan and the growth in abd membership during the fourth quarter of at our ohio health plan 
a decrease in claims inventory at our california  ohio  and utah health plans through the fourth quarter of the impact of the hn flu through the fourth quarter of the degree of change in the utilization of medical services and the cost per unit of those services during the impact of reductions to the state medicaid fee schedules in washington and michigan effective july   and in new mexico effective december  potential provider settlements across all states  particularly in missouri  new mexico  ohio  and washington 
the use of a consistent methodology in estimating our liability for claims and medical benefits payable minimizes the degree to which the under or overestimation of that liability at the close of one period may affect consolidated results of operations in subsequent periods 
facts and circumstances unique to the estimation process at any single date  however  may still lead to a material impact on consolidated results of operations in subsequent periods 
any absence of adverse claims development as well as the expensing through general and administrative expense of the costs to settle claims held at the start of the period will lead to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development in the period subsequent to the date of the original estimate 
however  that benefit will affect current period earnings only to the extent that the replenishment of the reserve for adverse claims development and the re accrual of administrative costs for the settlement of those claims is less than the benefit recognized from the prior period liability 
in and the absence of adverse development of the liability for claims and medical benefits payable at the close of the previous period resulted in the recognition of substantial favorable prior period development 
in both years  however  the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations because the amount of benefit recognized in each year was roughly consistent with that recognized in the previous year 
we seek to maintain a consistent claims reserving methodology across all periods 
accordingly  any prior period benefit from an un utilized reserve for adverse claims development may be offset by the establishment of a new reserve in an approximately equal amount relative to premium revenue  medical care costs  and medical claims and benefits payable in the current period  and thus the impact on earnings for the current period may be minimal 

table of contents the following table presents the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable for the years ended december  and the negative amounts displayed for components of medical care costs related to prior years represent the amount by which our original estimate of claims and benefits payable at the beginning of the period exceeded the actual amount of the liability based on information principally the payment of claims developed since that liability was first reported

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and restricted investments 
we invest a substantial portion of our cash in the pfm fund prime series institutional class  and the pfm fund government series 
these funds represent a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities that are managed by pfm asset management llc pfm  a virginia business trust registered as an open end management investment fund 
our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents are managed by professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines 
no investment that is in a loss position can be sold by our managers without our prior approval 
our investments consist solely of investment grade debt securities with a maximum maturity of ten years and an average duration of four years 
restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to payors consisting principally of the governments of each state in which our health plan subsidiaries operate 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and health care cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national health care cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies will mitigate health care cost inflation  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs
