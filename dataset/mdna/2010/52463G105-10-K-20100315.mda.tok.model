item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting principal and interest payments when due 
impaired loans with payments past due at or greater than days are generally maintained on a non accrual basis 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans and commercial real estate loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
generally the bank does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are subject to a troubled debt restructuring agreement 
at december   loans which have been determined to be impaired  which include all non accrual loans  totaled million with a corresponding specific reserve allowance of approximately million 
legacy banks engages an independent third party to conduct an annual review of its commercial mortgage and commercial loan portfolios 
these loan reviews provide a credit evaluation of selected individual loans to determine whether the risk ratings assigned are appropriate 
independent loan review findings are presented directly to the audit committee of the board of directors of the bank 
non performing loans the table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non performing assets at the dates indicated 
at december  legacy banks had seven loans totaling million considered to be troubled debt restructurings a loan for which a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven or the loan is modified at an interest rate less than current market rates 
of this amount  approximately million is included as part of the of non performing loans as of december  at december  legacy banks had no troubled debt restructurings 

table of contents if the non accrual loans  including non accrual troubled debt restructurings  had been current  the gross interest income which would have been recorded for the year ended december  is equal to approximately million 
interest income of approximately  was recorded in net income for the year ended december  on these loans 
interest income recognized on a cash basis was  at december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans residential mortgage commercial mortgage commercial home equity  consumer and other total non accrual loans loans greater than days delinquent and still accruing residential mortgage commercial mortgage commercial home equity  consumer and other total loans days delinquent and still accruing total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets troubled debt restructurings ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets nonperforming loans have increased in as the deterioration in general economic conditions have resulted in significant challenges for several individual and commercial borrowers 
the increase in nonperforming loans in relates primarily to a million commercial construction loan the bank placed on non accrual status as of the end of the first quarter 
this loan was restructured in the fourth quarter of and remains included in non performing loans at december  loans are placed on non accrual status either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full timely collection of interest and principal  or when a loan becomes days past due 
restructured loans represent performing loans for which concessions were granted due to a borrower s financial condition 
such concessions may include reductions of interest rates to below market terms and or extension of repayment terms 
allowance for loan losses 
in originating loans  legacy banks recognizes that losses will be experienced on loans and that the risk of loss will vary with many factors  including the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan over the term of the loan 
legacy banks maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and as such  this allowance represents management s best estimate of the probable known and inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the board and management take the following into consideration when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for each loan category or sub category i changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and other loan modifications  ii changes in the trend of loan charge offs and recoveries  iii changes in the nature  
table of contents volume or terms of the loan portfolios  iv changes in lending policies or procedures  including the banks loan review system  underwriting standards and collection  charge off and recovery practices  and the degree of oversight by the board  v changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  vi changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various industry and market segments  vii the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations  and viii the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the portfolios 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of allocated and general components 
the allocated component relates to loans classified as impaired  for which an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors  as outlined above 
while legacy banks believes that it has established adequate allocated and general allowances for losses on loans  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if future conditions differ substantially from the information used in making the evaluations 
in addition  as an integral part of their examination process  legacy banks regulators periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these regulatory agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination  thereby negatively affecting legacy banks financial condition and earnings

additionally  specific reserves related to certain loans caused the annual provision expense to increase in and the company also increased the reserve ratio for most loan portfolio categories in given current economic conditions 
the amount of the additions to the allowance charged to operating expense for each of the above years is a reflection of various factors analyzed by management  including the amount of loan growth in each year as well as the type of loan growth 
additionally  the amount of charge offs and recoveries in a given year will impact the amount of provision expense

federal regulations capital requirements 
under fdic regulations  federally insured state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system state non member banks  such as legacy banks  are required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements 
for an institution determined by the fdic to not be anticipating or experiencing significant growth and to be  in general  a strong banking organization rated composite under the uniform financial institutions ranking system established by the federal financial institutions examination council  the minimum capital leverage requirement is a ratio of tier capital to total assets of 
for all other institutions  the minimum leverage capital ratio is not less than 
tier capital is the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock including any related surplus and minority investments in certain subsidiaries  less intangible assets except for certain servicing rights and credit card relationships and certain other specified items 
the fdic regulations require state non member banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk weighted assets 
the ratio of regulatory capital to regulatory risk weighted assets is referred to as a bank s risk based capital ratio 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet items including recourse obligations  direct credit substitutes and residual interests to four risk weighted categories ranging from to  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
state non member banks must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least one half must be tier capital 
total capital consists of tier capital plus tier or supplementary capital items  which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and certain other capital instruments  and a portion of the net unrealized gain on equity securities 
the includable amount of tier capital cannot exceed the amount of the institution s tier capital 
banks that engage in specified levels of trading activities are subject to adjustments in their risk based capital calculation to ensure the maintenance of sufficient capital to support market risk 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act the fdicia required each federal banking agency to revise its risk based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk  and the risk of nontraditional activities  as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi family residential loans 
the fdic  along with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank s capital adequacy 
the fdic also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution s capital level is  or is likely to become  inadequate in light of the particular circumstances 
standards for safety and soundness 
as required by statute  the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and interagency guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness to implement safety and soundness standards 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines address internal controls and information systems  internal audit system  credit underwriting  loan documentation  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
most recently  the agencies have established standards for safeguarding customer information 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines  the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard 

table of contents investment activities 
all state chartered fdic insured banks  including savings banks  are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks  notwithstanding state law 
for example  state chartered banks may  with fdic approval  continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the nasdaq global market and in the shares of an investment company registered under the investment company act of  as amended 
the maximum permissible investment is of tier capital  as specified by the fdic s regulations  or the maximum amount permitted by massachusetts law  whichever is less 
legacy banks received approval from the fdic to retain and acquire such equity instruments equal to the lesser of of legacy banks tier capital or the maximum permissible amount specified by massachusetts law 
any such grandfathered authority may be terminated upon the fdic s determination that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk 
in addition  the fdic is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks other than non subsidiary equity investments if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the bank insurance fund 
the fdic has adopted revisions to its regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments

the new york state superintendent of banks may exercise certain regulatory authority over the bank s new york branch offices 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
federal law requires  among other things  that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  the law establishes five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the fdic has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation 
an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater 
an institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and generally a leverage ratio of or greater 
an institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or generally a leverage ratio of less than 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than 
an institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity as defined in the regulations to total assets that is equal to or less than 
as of december   legacy banks was classified as a well capitalized institution 
undercapitalized banks must adhere to growth  capital distribution including dividend and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
a bank s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of of the institution s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized 
if an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions  including but not limited to an order by the fdic to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or 
table of contents dismiss directors or officers  and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits  compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including  subject to a narrow exception  the appointment of a receiver or conservator within days after it obtains such status 
transaction with affiliates and regulation w of the federal reserve regulations 
transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
in a holding company context  the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank 
generally  sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w i limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus  and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus and ii require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non affiliate 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans  purchase of assets  issuance of a guarantee and other similar transactions 
in addition  loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in section a of the federal reserve act 
financial subsidiaries of banks are treated as affiliates for purposes of sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
however  i the capital limit on transactions between the bank and such financial subsidiary as an affiliate is not applicable  and ii the investment by the bank in the financial subsidiary does not include retained earnings in the financial subsidiary 
certain anti evasion provisions have been included that relate to the relationship between any financial subsidiary of a bank and sister companies of the bank any purchase of  or investment in  the securities of a financial subsidiary by any affiliate of the parent bank is considered a purchase or investment by the bank  or if the federal reserve board determines that such treatment is necessary  any loan made by an affiliate of the parent bank to the financial subsidiary is to be considered a loan made by the parent bank 
in addition  sections h and g of the federal reserve act place restrictions on loans to executive officers  directors and principal stockholders 
under section h of the federal reserve act  loans to a director  an executive officer and to a greater than stockholder of a financial institution  and certain affiliated interests of these  may not exceed  together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests  the financial institution s loans to one borrower limit  generally equal to of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus 
section h of the federal reserve act also requires that loans to directors  executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans 
in addition  the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus 
furthermore  section g of the federal reserve act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers 
enforcement 
the fdic has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks  including legacy banks

insurance of deposit accounts 
in october  deposit insurance by the federal deposit insurance corporation was increased to a maximum of  per depositor 
on january   the maximum insurance 
table of contents amount will return to  per depositor for all deposit accounts except certain retirement accounts  which will remain at  per depositor 
in addition  under the federal deposit insurance corporation s transaction account guarantee program  most of our non interest bearing transaction accounts are guaranteed regardless of amount until june  pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act  the federal deposit insurance corporation is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund annually at between and of estimated insured deposits 
as of june   the reserve ratio had decreased to as a result of bank failures 
as part of a plan to restore the reserve ratio to  the federal deposit insurance corporation imposed a special assessment equal to five basis points of assets less tier capital as of june   which was payable on september  in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation has increased its quarterly assessment rates and amended the method by which rates are calculated 
beginning in the second quarter of  institutions are assigned an initial base assessment rate ranging from to basis points of deposits depending on risk category 
the initial base assessment is then adjusted based upon the level of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits to establish a total base assessment rate ranging from seven to basis points 
on november   the federal deposit insurance corporation approved a final rule requiring insured depository institutions to prepay on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of   and estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of are based upon the assessment rate in effect on september   with three basis points added for the and assessment rates 
in addition  a annual growth in the assessment base is assumed 
prepaid assessments are to be applied against the actual quarterly assessments until exhausted  and may not be applied to any special assessments that may occur in the future 
any unused prepayments will be returned to the institution on june  on december   the bank prepaid million in estimated assessment fees for years through because the prepaid assessments represent the prepayment of future expense  they do not affect our regulatory capital the prepaid asset will have a risk weighting of or tax obligations 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the federal deposit insurance corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
we do not currently know of any practice  condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance

community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act  or cra  as amended and as implemented by fdic regulations  a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra does require the fdic  in connection with its examination of a bank  to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution  including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions 
the cra requires the fdic to provide a written evaluation of an institution s cra performance utilizing a four tiered descriptive rating system 
legacy banks latest fdic cra rating was outstanding 
massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the cra which is also applicable to legacy banks 
the massachusetts version is generally similar to the cra but utilizes a five tiered descriptive rating system 
massachusetts law requires the massachusetts commissioner of banks to consider  but not be limited to  a bank s record of performance under massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit taking facility  to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution

federal reserve system the federal reserve board regulations require depository institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts 
the federal reserve board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating million or less which may be adjusted by the federal reserve board the reserve requirement is  and the amounts greater than million require a reserve which may be adjusted by the federal reserve board between and 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances which may be adjusted by the federal reserve board are exempted from the reserve requirements 
legacy banks is in compliance with these requirements 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system  which consists of regional federal home loan banks 
the fhlb provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
legacy banks  as a member of the fhlb of boston  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb of boston 
legacy banks was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in fhlb of boston stock at december  of million 
the federal home loan banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including contributing funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the fhlb pay to their members and result in the fhlb imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members 
for the years ended   and cash dividends from the fhlb of boston to legacy banks amounted to approximately   and  respectively 
as a result of the current economic conditions and the reduced levels of capital  the fhlb announced at the end of that they will suspend the payment of any future dividends until such time as their financial condition improves 
the bank  therefore  did not receive any cash dividends in and does not anticipate receiving any from this investment in further  there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the fhlb will not also cause a decrease in the value of the fhlb stock held by the bank 
holding company regulation general federal law allows a state savings bank that qualifies as a qualified thrift lender  discussed below  to elect to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of federal law 
such election allows its holding company to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the ots rather than as a bank holding company by the federal reserve board 
legacy banks made such election and the company is a non diversified unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of federal law 
as such  the company is registered with the ots and has adhered to the ots s regulations and reporting requirements 
in addition  the ots may examine and supervise the company and the ots has enforcement authority over the company and its non savings institution subsidiaries 
among other things  this authority permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution 
additionally  legacy banks is required to notify the ots at least days before declaring any dividend to the company 
by regulation  the ots may restrict or prohibit the bank from paying dividends 
the gramm leach bliley act of expanded the authority of bank holding companies to affiliate with other financial services companies such as insurance companies and investment banking companies 
the act  however  provided that unitary savings and loan holding companies  such as the company  may only engage in 
table of contents activities permitted to a financial holding company under the legislation and those permitted for a multiple savings and loan holding company 
upon any non supervisory acquisition by the company of another savings association as a separate subsidiary  the company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company 
federal law limits the activities of a multiple savings and loan holding company and its non insured institution subsidiaries primarily to activities permissible for bank holding companies under section c of the bank holding company act  provided the prior approval of the ots is obtained  to other activities authorized by ots regulation and to those permitted for financial holding companies 
multiple savings and loan holding companies are generally prohibited from acquiring or retaining more than of a non subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by federal law 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from  directly or indirectly  acquiring more than of the voting stock of another savings association or savings and loan holding company or from acquiring such an institution or company by merger  consolidation or purchase of its assets  without prior written approval of the ots 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations  the ots considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and the institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the ots rather than as a bank holding company by the federal reserve board  the bank must qualify as a qualified thrift lender 
to qualify as a qualified thrift lender  the bank must maintain compliance with the test for a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code  or with a qualified thrift lender test 
under the qualified thrift lender test  a savings institution is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets total assets less specified liquid assets up to of total assets  intangibles  including goodwill  and the value of property used to conduct business in certain qualified thrift investments primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage backed and related securities in at least months out of each month period

under certain circumstances  a change in control may occur  and prior notice is required  upon the acquisition of or more of the company s outstanding voting stock  unless the ots has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control of the company 
under the change in bank control act  the ots has days from the filing of a complete notice to act  taking into consideration certain factors  including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti trust effects of the acquisition 
any company that acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company 
massachusetts holding company regulation in addition to the federal holding company regulations  a bank holding company organized or doing business in massachusetts must comply with any regulation under the massachusetts law 
the term bank holding company  for the purposes of massachusetts law  is defined generally to include any company which  directly or indirectly  owns  controls or holds with power to vote more than of the voting stock of each of two or more banking institutions  including commercial banks and state co operative banks  savings banks and savings and loan associations and national banks  federal savings banks and federal savings and loan associations 
in general  a holding company controlling  directly or indirectly  only one banking institution will not be deemed to be a bank holding company for the purposes of massachusetts law 
under massachusetts law  the prior approval of the board of bank incorporation is required before the following any company may become a bank holding company  any bank holding company acquires direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting stock of  or all or substantially all of the assets of  a banking institution  or any bank holding company merges with another bank holding company

table of contents taxation federal taxes in general the company and legacy banks report their income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting 
the federal income tax laws apply to the company and legacy banks in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions  including particularly legacy bank s reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to legacy banks or the company 
legacy bank s federal income tax returns have been either audited or closed under the statute of limitations through tax year bad debt reserves for fiscal years beginning before december   thrift institutions which qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve 
a reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans  generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved  under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method 
the reserve for non qualifying loans was computed using the experience method 
federal legislation enacted in repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves 
approximately million of the bank s accumulated bad debt reserves will not be recaptured into taxable income unless the bank makes a nondividend distribution to the company as described below 
distributions if the bank makes nondividend distributions to the company  they will be considered to have been made from the bank s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves  including the balance of its reserves as of december   to the extent of the those reserves and then from the bank s supplemental reserve for losses on loans  to the extent of those reserves  and an amount based on the amount distributed  but not more than the amount of those aggregate reserves  will be included in the bank s taxable income 
nondividend distributions include distributions in excess of the bank s current and accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  distributions in redemption of stock  and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
dividends paid out of the bank s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be included in the bank s taxable income 
the amount of additional taxable income triggered by a nondividend distribution is an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
therefore  if the bank makes a nondividend distribution to the company  approximately one and one half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate 
the bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves 
massachusetts taxation the massachusetts excise tax rate for savings banks is currently of federal taxable income  adjusted for certain items  but recent legislation will reduce this rate to on a phase in basis in the years taxable income includes gross income as defined under the internal revenue code  plus interest from bonds  notes and evidences of indebtedness of any state  including massachusetts  less deductions  but not the credits  allowable under the provisions of the internal revenue code  except no deduction is allowed for bonus depreciation or for taxes paid to the state which are based on income 
carryforwards and carrybacks of net operating losses are not allowed 
a financial institution or business corporation is generally entitled to special tax treatment as a securities corporation  provided that a its activities are limited to buying  selling  dealing in or holding securities on its own behalf and not as a broker  and b it has applied for  and received  classification as a securities corporation by the commissioner of the massachusetts department of revenue 
a securities corporation that is also a bank holding company under the code must pay a tax equal to of its gross income 
a securities corporation that is not a bank holding company under the code must pay a tax equal to of its gross income 
legacy bancorp  inc  as well as one of the bank s subsidiaries  legacy securities corporation inc  are considered securities corporations for massachusetts excise tax purposes

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors are relevant to our future results and financial success  and should be read with care 
risks related to our business the united states economy is in recession 
a prolonged economic downturn  especially one affecting our geographic market area  could materially affect our business and financial results 
the united states economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of throughout the course of and into  economic conditions continued to worsen  due in large part to the fallout from the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market 
unemployment remains at very high levels and is not expected to improve in the near future 
our lending business is tied  in large part  to the housing market 
the continuing housing slump has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing  declines in home prices  and could ultimately result in increased delinquencies on our residential  commercial and construction mortgage loans 
further  the ongoing concern about the stability of the financial markets in general has caused many lenders to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers 
these conditions may also cause a further reduction in loan demand  and increases in our non performing assets  net charge offs and provisions for loan losses 
continued negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the market for and value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
moreover  continued declines in the stock market in general  or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically  could adversely affect our stock performance 
the federal deposit insurance corporation actions to recapitalize the deposit insurance fund 
on may   the fdic adopted a final rule levying a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus tier capital as of september  the special assessment was paid on september  we recorded an expense of  during the quarter ended june   to reflect the special assessment 
the final rule permitted the fdic s board of directors to levy up to two additional special assessments of up to five basis points each during if the fdic estimated that the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio will fall to a level that the fdic s board of directors believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a level that will be close to or below zero 
although there were no further special assessments in  any such action by the fdic in the future will be recorded as an expense during the appropriate period 
the federal deposit insurance corporation also adopted a rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions prepaid on december  their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of  and the assessment rate for the fourth quarter of and for is based on each institution s total base assessment rate for the third quarter of  modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on september  had been in effect for the entire third quarter  and the assessment rate for and will be equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional three basis points 
in addition  each institution s base assessment rate for each period will be calculated using its third quarter assessment base  
table of contents adjusted quarterly for an estimated annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of we recorded the pre payment as a prepaid expense  which will be amortized to expense over three years 
based on our deposits and assessment rate as of september   our prepayment amount was million 
if our investment in the federal home loan bank of boston is classified as other than temporarily impaired or as permanently impaired  our earnings and stockholders equity would decrease 
we own common stock of the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb 
we hold this stock to qualify for membership in the federal home loan bank system and to be eligible to borrow funds under the fhlbb s advance program 
the aggregate cost and fair value of our fhlbb common stock as of december  was million based on its par value 
there is no market for our fhlbb common stock 
recent published reports indicate that certain member banks of the federal home loan bank system may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of a federal home loan bank  including the fhlbb  could be substantially diminished 
consequently  we believe that there is a risk that our investment in fhlbb common stock could be impaired at some time in the future 
if this occurs  it would cause our earnings and stockholders equity to decrease by the after tax amount of the impairment charge 
the federal home loan bank of boston has suspended dividends 
this will negatively affect our earnings 
the federal home loan bank of boston has not paid dividends on its stock since suspending them during the fourth quarter of and it is uncertain when these payments will recommence 
we received  in dividends from the federal home loan bank of boston during the year ended december   and the failure of the federal home loan bank of boston to pay dividends for any quarter will reduce our earnings during that quarter 
lack of consumer confidence in financial institutions may decrease our level of deposits 
our level of deposits may be affected by lack of consumer confidence in financial institutions  which has resulted in large numbers of depositors unwilling to maintain deposits that are not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
in some cases  depositors have withdrawn deposits and invested uninsured funds in investments perceived as being more secure  such as securities issued by the us treasury 
these consumer preferences may force us to pay higher interest rates to retain deposits as we seek to meet funding needs caused by reduced deposit levels 
economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity 
in the past year  significant declines in the values of mortgage backed securities and derivative securities issued by financial institutions  government sponsored entities  and major commercial and investment banks has led to decreased confidence in financial markets among borrowers  lenders  and depositors  as well as disruption and extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets and the failure of some entities in the financial sector 
as a result  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us 
future legislative or regulatory actions responding to perceived financial and market problems could impair our rights against borrowers 
as a result of the recent financial crisis  the potential exists for the promulgation of new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  which are expected to result in the issuance of many formal enforcement orders 
negative developments in the financial services industry and the credit markets  and the impact of new legislation in response to these developments  may negatively affect our 
table of contents operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans and pursue business opportunities 
compliance with such regulation also will likely increase our costs 
there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
were proposals such as these  or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor  to be implemented  we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
our commercial real estate and commercial loans expose us to increased credit risks  and these risks will increase if we succeed in increasing these types of loans 
in general  commercial real estate loans and commercial loans generate higher returns  but also pose greater credit risks  than do owner occupied residential mortgage loans 
as our various commercial loan portfolios increase  the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans will also increase 
we make both secured and some short term unsecured commercial loans 
unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because  without collateral  repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers businesses 
secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by equipment  leases  inventory and accounts receivable 
compared to real estate  that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor  its value is harder to ascertain  it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed 
our continuing concentration of loans in our primary market areas may increase our risk 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which we conduct business 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in berkshire county  in western massachusetts  as well as in eastern new york 
the local economic conditions in our market areas have a significant impact on our loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control would affect these local economic conditions and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because we have a significant amount of commercial real estate loans  decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
financial service sector concentration within our investment portfolio 
within the investment portfolio  the company has a significant amount of marketable equity securities and corporate debt securities  including mortgage backed securities  issued by companies in the financial services sector 
given the current market conditions  this sector has an enhanced level of credit risk 
changes in market interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability  like that of most financial institutions  depends to a large extent upon our net interest income  which is the difference  or spread  between our gross interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and our interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  our results of operations and financial condition depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements  including our adjustable rate mortgage loans  which represent a large portion of our residential loan portfolio 
changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
because  as a general matter  our interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more quickly than our interest earning assets  an increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest income 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk management 

table of contents we are also subject to reinvestment risk relating to interest rate movements 
decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are not able to reinvest funds from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on the prepaid loans or securities 
on the other hand  increases in interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans result in larger mortgage payments due from borrowers  which could potentially increase our level of loan delinquencies and defaults 
we may have difficulty meeting our branch expansion goals  and our branch expansion strategy may not be accretive to earnings 
our growth plans may include the opening of new branch offices in communities served by legacy banks as well as in other communities contiguous to those currently served by legacy banks 
our ability to establish new branches will depend upon whether we can identify suitable sites and negotiate acceptable lease or purchase and sale terms  and we may not be able to do so  or it may take longer than we expect 
moreover  once we establish a new branch  numerous factors will contribute to its performance  such as a suitable location  qualified personnel and an effective marketing strategy 
additionally  it takes time for a new branch to gather significant loans and deposits to generate enough income to offset its expenses  some of which  like salaries and occupancy expense  are relatively fixed costs 
there can be no assurance that our branch expansion strategy will be accretive to our earnings  or that it will be accretive to earnings within a reasonable period of time 
our ability to grow may be limited if we cannot make acquisitions 
in an effort to increase our loan and deposit growth  we will continue to seek to expand our banking franchise  including through acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches if opportunities arise 
our ability to grow through selective acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches will depend on successfully identifying  acquiring and integrating them 
we compete with other financial institutions with respect to proposed acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we can successfully integrate any acquired financial institutions or branches into our banking organization in a timely or efficient manner  that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or that we can achieve anticipated operating efficiencies 
strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability 
we face significant competition both in attracting deposits and in the origination of loans 
savings banks  credit unions  savings and loan associations and commercial banks operating in our primary market area have historically provided most of our competition for deposits 
in addition  and particularly in times of high interest rates  we face additional and significant competition for funds from money market mutual funds and issuers of corporate and government securities 
competition for the origination of real estate and other loans comes from other thrift institutions  commercial banks  insurance companies  finance companies  other institutional lenders and mortgage companies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
moreover  we may face increased competition in the origination of loans if competing thrift institutions convert to stock form  because such converting thrifts would likely seek to invest their new capital into loans 
finally  credit unions do not pay federal or state income taxes and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than savings banks and as a result  they may enjoy a competitive advantage over us 
this advantage places significant competitive pressure on the prices of our loans and deposits 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in law and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination as outlined in the regulation and supervision section of this report 
any change in the laws or regulations applicable to us  or in banking regulators supervisory policies or examination procedures  whether by the massachusetts commissioner of banks  the fdic  the federal reserve board  the office of thrift supervision  other state or federal regulators  the united states congress or the massachusetts legislature could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents legislative proposals have been introduced that would eliminate the office of thrift supervision  legacy bancorp s primary federal regulator  which would require legacy bancorp to become a bank holding company 
legislation has been proposed that would implement sweeping changes to the current bank regulatory structure  including eliminating our current primary federal regulator  the office of thrift supervision  by merging the office of thrift supervision into the comptroller of the currency the primary federal regulator for national banks 
the proposed legislation would also establish a financial services oversight council and grant the board of governors of the federal reserve system exclusive authority to regulate all banks and thrift holding companies 
as a result  legacy bancorp would become a holding company subject to supervision by the federal reserve board as opposed to the office of thrift supervision  and would become subject to the federal reserve s regulations  including holding company capital requirements  that legacy bancorp would not be subject to as a savings and loan holding company 
in addition  compliance with new regulations and being supervised by one or more new regulatory agencies could increase our expenses 
we could record future losses on our securities portfolio 
during the year ended december   we recognized total other than temporary impairment of million on our portfolio of securities and other investments 
we considered all of this impairment to be credit related and  therefore  in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we recorded all of the impairment as losses through a reduction of non interest income 
a number of factors or combinations of factors could require us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to our securities portfolio constitutes additional impairment that is other than temporary  which could result in material losses to us 
these factors include  but are not limited to  a failure by an issuer to make scheduled interest payments  an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security  an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value 
in addition  the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the issuers deteriorates and there remains limited liquidity for these securities

lending is the major driver of revenue and we are committed to supporting our loan growth 
we recognize that loan and deposit growth are interdependent  and over the long term both must grow consistently 
one of our biggest challenges is to grow our customer base and to grow the depth and breadth of our customer relationships 
we address this challenge by maintaining our focus on anticipating  understanding and assisting our customers in achieving their financial goals 
our deposit pricing strategy is two fold 
first  our relationship savings product is important to our deposit mix 
it requires customers to maintain a checking account as part of the relationship  the goal being to create multiple relationships with our customers to aid both profitability and customer retention 
the relationship savings product is structured and priced like a money market deposit or fund  except that it does not offer check writing 
relationship savings deposits amounted to million as of december  our experience with money market type deposit accounts has been that they become a long term  stable funding source at reasonable cost 
the second 
table of contents component in our pricing strategy is to continuously offer a selection of special certificates of deposit with competitive interest rates 
another challenge is being able to maintain sufficient asset size or scale to provide the marketing  technology  service and other support functions so that we will continue to be relevant and competitive 
it is for these reasons that management emphasizes and monitors growth in terms of customers  customer households  customer relationships  assets  revenue per employee  and efficiency 
we also know that to successfully grow  our employees must be extremely well trained and experienced 
we regularly monitor training hours per employee  employee turnover and employee and customer satisfaction surveys 
periodically  we also engage a mystery shopping firm that sends representatives into each of our locations to experience and witness what the customer experiences and then provide us with constructive feedback 
critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies  which govern the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
refer to footnote to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered critical due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the underlying assumptions used  and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in material changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered necessary 
the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on a periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and size of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
for a full discussion of the allowance for loan losses  please refer to business of legacy bancorp and subsidiaries asset quality 
income taxes legacy bancorp uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is established when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  a valuation allowance was established against deferred tax assets related to the uncertain utilization of the charitable contribution carryforward created primarily by the donation to the legacy banks foundation as part of the conversion 
the contribution carryforward expires in  and the allowance amounted to million as of december  deferred tax assets applicable to capital loss carryforwards of million are recoverable only to the extent that capital gains can be realized during the carryforward period 
of the total capital loss carryforward    and million expire in  and  respectively 
the judgments applied by management consider the likelihood that capital gain income will be realized within the carryforward period in light of our tax planning strategies and changes in market conditions 
as of december  a valuation allowance was established against deferred tax assets related to the uncertain utilization of the capital loss carryforward created primarily by the sale of the company s portfolio of private label mortgage backed securities in this capital loss carryforward expires in  and the allowance amounted to million as of december  
table of contents other than temporary impairment each reporting period  the company evaluates all securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity  with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether or not the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary otti 
marketable equity securities are evaluated for otti based on the severity and duration of the impairment and  if deemed to be other than temporary  the declines in fair value are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
for debt securities  otti is required to be recognized if the company intends to sell the security  if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
for all impaired debt securities that the company intends to sell  or more likely than not will be required to sell  the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as otti through earnings 
credit related otti for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings 
non credit related otti for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the company investment in both the stock from the federal home loan bank fhlb as well as certain real estate partnerships is also evaluated for otti on a periodic basis 
the fair value of fhlb stock is based upon the redemption value of the stock which equates to its carrying value 
the value of the bank s investment in certain real estate partnerships is based on an analysis of the financial statements of the partnerships and underlying real estate projects 
fair values of assets and liabilities the company groups its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in three levels  based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value 
level valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities 
level valuation is based on observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using unobservable inputs to pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
in august  the fasb issued guidance for measuring the fair value of a liability in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
in such instances  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value utilizing a valuation technique that uses i the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  ii quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or iii another valuation technique that is consistent with the existing principles for measuring fair value  such as an income approach or market approach 
the new guidance also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
the guidance was adopted on september  and did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
