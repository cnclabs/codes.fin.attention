item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the past two years  rosetta significantly transformed itself as a company 
the actions taken to affect this business shift were underpinned by a relatively straightforward goal to position the company for visible and sustainable future growth 
we believe that achieving this goal is essential in order for rosetta to create long term shareholder value 
as part of our transformation  we took many steps to improve the underlying fundamentals of virtually every aspect of our business 
most notably  we committed to building a portfolio of high quality unconventional assets with significant project inventory potential 
in addition  we sought to establish the technical and organizational competencies required for executing a resource driven business model 
these asset and competency efforts were matched with a fiscal approach that maintained relative conservatism and a focus on cost control and efficiency 
while we will continue to evolve and optimize each of these areas over time  we believe we made significant progress in transforming rosetta into a resource player since the effort began in early we believe that our performance offers tangible evidence that our strategy shift is yielding success 
against one of the most challenging business climates in years  we lived within our means while delivering results from our activities in new and legacy asset programs 
of significance  we note the following highlights with respect to our performance in we tested two new shale plays  namely the eagle ford shale in south texas and the alberta basin bakken shale in montana 
in the eagle ford  we grew our acreage position and drilled four wells in the play 
we completed two wells  both of which were discoveries 
the discoveries set up the potential for a significant future development effort that will start in in the alberta basin bakken shale  we drilled two wells on our large exploratory acreage position 
we drilled and completed one horizontal well and drilled one additional vertical well 
we acquired core samples and ran extensive log suites in both wells to obtain important geologic and reservoir data about the play 
since we consider this early stage exploration  we intend to fully analyze and evaluate our drilling  completion and logging results in order to optimize our program activity 
in addition to testing our new shale plays  we advanced the studies of our legacy assets using an unconventional lens approach 
under this approach  our assets are thoroughly analyzed and re engineered to identify remaining resource potential 
we believe our legacy onshore assets  especially the dj basin and the sacramento basin  contain significant remaining resource potential that was overlooked under a historical exploitation approach that utilized conventional techniques 
we believe the project inventory potential of our legacy assets is a competitive advantage for rosetta 
we identified assets for possible sale and established an ongoing process to divest of non core assets 
during  we designated our gulf of mexico  texas state waters and several small assets as non core given that they do not have the unconventional resource characteristics we seek 
we generated approximately million of proceeds from sales of a portion of our non core assets in in addition to asset sales  we took other measures to ensure our financial flexibility during the year 
we monitored capital program results on a continuous basis and shifted or adjusted spending as necessary 
we refinanced our existing debt and extended our maturities 
we hedged selectively during the latter part of into a period of relative commodity price strength 

table of contents in  our portfolio actions  in combination with prudent fiscal measures  strengthened our ability to deliver on the visible and sustainable growth that we are striving for as a resource player 
accordingly  we believe we enter at an inflection point on performance 
we believe that we are in the relatively early stages of creating value from our meaningful positions in the new eagle ford and alberta basin bakken shale plays 
with success in either or both of these plays  we could recognize significant reserve and production upside to our current levels 
furthermore  success in either or both of these plays could shift our product mix toward a higher percentage of oil  which would provide attractive diversification for rosetta 
finally  we believe the inventory potential from our legacy onshore assets provides a high value base of production and reserves with relatively low capital intensity 
in combination with our new shale plays  we believe rosetta possesses a unique combination of assets for a company of our size 
our business goals for are predicated on an announced capital program of million  subject to program results and timing 
we expect to initiate development activities in the eagle ford  where our efforts will likely focus in the condensate prone area surrounding our gates ranch discovery 
we expect to continue testing our alberta basin bakken position  as well as conduct modest programs in several legacy assets 
we intend to continue our effort to build lease positions in existing core areas  if possible  but also to pursue entry into new basins of interest 
we prefer organic opportunities  but we are also expanding our capability to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that fit our business model 
we believe this balanced approach is appropriate for long term success  however  it is not our intention or desire to pursue acquisitions solely for the sake of growth  but rather that fit our strategic and economic objectives 
we recognize that  despite what we believe was a successful year in  the operating environment for our industry continues to be somewhat uncertain and rosetta s success in or beyond is not assured 
commodity prices  particularly for natural gas  continue to be impacted by anemic demand and the lack of a meaningful supply response to lower prices in access to some oilfield services are starting to tighten 
attractive acquisitions or leasing opportunities remain extremely competitive 
finally  given the early stage of the eagle ford and alberta basin bakken plays  there is still significant risk to those programs 
we attempt to manage these risks by carefully monitoring the environment  working closely with our suppliers and vendors  staying abreast of the marketplace  and moving at a deliberative pace in our new play programs 
nevertheless  regardless of how effectively we manage these risks  they represent threats to our ability to achieve our growth goals and build our asset base 
in approving our capital budget of million  we indicated that the program could be funded from internally generated cash flows plus cash on hand at an average gas price of roughly per mcf and an average oil price of roughly per bbl 
in that price environment  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and operational flexibility at this time to fund and actively manage our stated capital expenditures program 
we monitor our liquidity situation continuously 
we intend to maintain a position in which we can execute prudent and timely decisions should commodity prices  services costs  or market conditions change 
in the event that we encounter a situation in which we do not have sufficient internal funds to execute our planned capital program  fund incremental organic opportunities or pursue attractive acquisitions  we would consider curtailing our capital spending  drawing on the unused capacity under our existing revolving credit facility or accessing capital markets 
as of december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we have not received any indication from our lenders that draws under the credit facility are restricted below current availability at this time and we are proactively communicating with them on a routine basis 
we affirmed our borrowing base in the third quarter of at million and the next redetermination is scheduled to begin in march our ability to raise additional capital depends on the current state of the financial markets  which are subject to general economic and industry conditions 
therefore  the availability and price of capital in the financial markets could negatively affect our liquidity position and cost of borrowed money 
in order to ensure that rosetta preserves the necessary financial flexibility  we work closely with our lenders to stay abreast of market and creditor conditions 
of note  our capital expenditures are primarily in areas where rosetta acts as operator and has high working interests 
as a result  we do not believe we have significant exposure to joint interest partners who may be unable to fund their portion of any capital program  but we monitor partner situations routinely

table of contents depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
dd a expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the decrease is due to a decrease in total production and a lower dd a rate for compared to due to the full cost ceiling test impairment charges recognized during the second half of and during the first quarter of  which decreased the full cost pool 
the dd a rate for the year ended december  was per mcfe while the rate for the year ended december  was per mcfe 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
based upon the quarterly ceiling test computations using hedge adjusted market prices during the year ended december   at march   the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling and a pre tax  non cash impairment expense of million was recorded 
there was no impact on the ceiling test of applying the new sec guidance 
whereas based upon the quarterly ceiling test computations using hedge adjusted market prices during the year ended december   the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling and a pre tax  non cash impairment expense of million was recorded 
general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs  net of capitalized exploration and development overhead costs of million  decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the decrease in general and administrative costs incurred in the current period is primarily related to decreases of million in legal fees related to the calpine litigation  which settled during  and an increase of million in billable field personnel offset by a million decrease in capitalizable geological and geophysical expenses  a million increase in salaries and wages resulting from the additional technical personnel hired during and a million increase in bonus expense 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  lease operating expense 
lease operating expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for this overall increase is primarily due to the increase in the number of productive wells as well as increased production of for which led to higher costs for equipment rentals  maintenance and repairs  and costs associated with non operated properties 
lease operating expense includes workover costs of per mcfe  ad valorem taxes of per mcfe and insurance of per mcfe for the year ended december  as compared to workover costs of per mcfe  ad valorem taxes of per mcfe and insurance of per mcfe for the same period in production taxes 
production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase is the result of increased production in areas that do not qualify for tax credits for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
dd a expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the increase is due to a increase in total production and a higher dd a rate for due to the decrease in oil and natural gas reserves as compared to the dd a rate for the year ended december  was per mcfe while the rate for the year ended december  was per mcfe due to the increase in finding costs 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
based upon the quarterly ceiling test computations using hedge adjusted market prices during the year ended december   and in conjunction with the downward revisions of a portion of our reserves in the third and fourth quarters of  the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling and a pre tax  non cash impairment expense of million was recorded 
there were no ceiling test impairments during the year ended december  general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs  net of capitalized exploration and development overhead costs of million  increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for  with capitalized exploration and development overhead costs of million 
the increase in costs incurred in were primarily related to increases in legal fees related to the calpine litigation of million and increases in payroll expenses of million resulting from increased headcount and a million accrual related to the severance of a former executive officer  as well as the absence of approximately million in ceo transition costs that were incurred in but not total other expense other expense includes interest expense  interest income and other income expense  net which decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease in other expense is primarily the result of a million charge related to the settlement of litigation with calpine in for which there were no related expenses during offset by a million increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates on the restated credit facilities and increased amortization of deferred loan fees and original issue discount related to the restated credit facilities during the first quarter of other expense increased million for the year ended december  to million as compared to million in the same period in the increase in other expense was the result of a million charge related to the calpine settlement partially offset by million decrease in interest expense in 
table of contents provision for income taxes our income tax benefit of million was primarily due to the first quarter ceiling test write down 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate was compared to the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes differs from the taxes computed at the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the effect of state taxes  a tax shortfall arising from our deferred compensation plans  and other permanent differences 
we provide for deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in our financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we have a deferred tax asset of approximately million resulting primarily from the difference between the book basis and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties compared to a deferred tax asset of approximately million at december  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable income generated by the production of our oil and natural gas properties 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity and capital is our operating cash flow 
we also maintain a revolving line of credit  which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow 
operating cash flow 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and natural gas and the success of our development and exploration activities as well as future acquisitions 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by executing derivative transactions to hedge the change in prices of a portion of our production  thereby mitigating our exposure to price declines  but these transactions may also limit our earnings potential in periods of rising natural gas prices 
the effects of these derivative transactions on our natural gas sales are discussed above under results of operations natural gas 
the majority of our capital expenditures is discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows decline from expected levels 
current economic conditions and lower commodity prices could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 
we will continue to monitor our cash flow and liquidity and  if appropriate  we may consider adjusting our capital expenditure program 
senior secured revolving line of credit 
on april   we amended and restated our revolving credit agreement the restated revolver with bnp paribas  as administrative agent  and the other lenders identified therein to provide for a senior secured revolving line of credit in the amount of up to million and to extend its term until july  availability under the restated revolver is restricted to the borrowing base  which is subject to review and adjustment on a semi annual basis and other interim adjustments  including adjustments based on our hedging arrangements 
our borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of reserves as well as the pricing outlook at the time of the redetermination 
a reduction in capital spending could result in a reduced level of reserves thus causing a reduction in the borrowing base 
after the redetermination in october  the borrowing base under the restated revolver is million 
amounts outstanding under the restated revolver bear interest at specified margins over the london interbank offered rate libor of to 
borrowings under the restated revolver are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets  including a mortgage lien on oil and natural gas properties having at least of the pre tax sec pv reserve value  a guaranty by all of our domestic subsidiaries  and a pledge of of the membership interests of domestic subsidiaries 
these collateralized amounts under the mortgages are subject to semi annual reviews based on updated reserve information 
we are subject to the financial covenants of a minimum current ratio of not less than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter and a maximum leverage ratio of not greater than to  calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended  measured quarterly after giving pro forma effect to acquisitions and divestitures 
at december   our current ratio was and the leverage ratio was in addition  we are subject to covenants limiting dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of debt  changes of control  asset sales  and liens on properties 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  as of february   we had million outstanding  which is due and payable on july   with million available for borrowing under the restated revolver 
second lien term loan 
on april   we also amended and restated our term loan the restated term loan with bnp paribas  as administrative agent  and other lenders and extended its term until october  borrowings under the restated term loan were initially set at million and bear interest at libor plus with a libor floor of 
the restated term loan had an option to increase fixed and floating rate borrowings by up to million to million prior to may  we exercised this option on april   and the increased borrowings consisted of million of floating rate borrowings and million of fixed rate borrowings at 
the loan is collateralized by second priority liens on substantially all of our assets 
we are subject to the financial covenants of a minimum asset coverage ratio of not less than to and a maximum leverage ratio of not more than to  calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended  measured quarterly after giving pro forma effect to acquisitions and divestitures 
at december   our asset coverage ratio was and the leverage ratio was in addition  we are subject to covenants limiting dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of debt  changes of control  asset sales  and liens on properties 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  as of december   we had million of variable rate borrowings and million of fixed rate borrowings outstanding under the restated term loan 
at december   the principal balance of the restated term loan was due and payable on october  we have the right to prepay the restated term loan at any time on or after the first anniversary of the effective date april   in whole or in part  from april  to april  with a premium equal to of such amount prepaid or subsequent to april  without premium or penalty provided that each prepayment is in an amount that is an integral multiple of million and not less than million  or if such amount is less than million  the outstanding principal amount 

table of contents working capital at december   we had a working capital surplus of million as compared to a working capital surplus of million at december  our working capital is affected primarily by fluctuations in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments  deferred taxes associated with hedging activities  cash and cash equivalents balance and our capital spending program 
the surplus for was largely caused by the increases in our cash balance 
as of december   the working capital asset balances of our cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments were approximately million and million  respectively  and there was no balance for current deferred tax assets 
in addition  the associated working capital liability balances for accrued liabilities were approximately million as of december  cash flows year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
key drivers of net cash provided by operating activities are commodity prices  production volumes and costs and expenses  which primarily include operating costs  taxes other than income taxes  transportation and general and administrative expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a primary source of liquidity and capital used to finance our capital expenditures for the year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for this decrease is largely due to lower oil and natural gas prices and production during compared to for the year ended december   we had net losses of million with a decrease in production of as compared to the year ended december  with net losses of million 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for this increase is largely due to higher oil and natural gas prices during compared to for the year ended december   we had net losses of million with an increase of production of as compared to the year ended december  with net income of million 
investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities is capital spending 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for  which primarily reflected reduced expenditures for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and drilling 
acquisitions of oil and gas properties decreased million and purchases of oil and gas assets decreased million from to as a result of our decision to exercise prudence and caution with our capital spending in order to preserve our liquidity and maximize our financial position during a period of low commodity prices and reduced demand for natural gas 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures as compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we participated in the drilling of gross wells as compared to the drilling of gross wells for the year ended december  cash flows used in investing activities increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for  which reflected expenditures for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and drilling 
the company acquired the petroflow properties in the san juan basin for million  the pinedale and south texas properties for approximately million  and the calpine non consent properties as part of the calpine settlement for million 
additionally  acquisition costs for the year ended december  include a non cash purchase price adjustment of million related to the release of suspended revenues and non consent liabilities associated with non consent properties as part of the settlement of litigation with calpine  as well as an million reduction in accrued capital costs 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures as compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we participated in the drilling of gross wells as compared to the drilling of gross wells for the year ended december  
table of contents financing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in financing activities is equity transactions and issuance and repayments of debt 
cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the net decrease is primarily related to payments of million made in against the restated revolver and million of deferred loan fees related to the restated credit facilities netted with million of borrowings in compared to million of borrowings in in addition  there was a decrease of approximately million in the stock options exercised for the year ended december  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the net increase is primarily related to net borrowings of million made in against the revolver 
in addition  there was an increase of approximately million in the stock options exercised for the year ended december  compared to commodity price risk  interest rate risk and related hedging activities the energy markets have historically been very volatile  and there can be no assurance that oil and natural gas prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices  management hedges oil and natural gas prices from time to time primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments including fixed price swaps  basis swaps  costless collars and put options 
although not risk free  we believe these activities will reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
consistent with this policy  we have entered into a series of natural gas fixed price swaps and costless collars  which are intended to establish a fixed price or an average floor and ceiling price for to of our expected natural gas production through the fixed price swap agreements we have entered into require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a notional quantity of natural gas without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments were based on expected proved production from existing wells at inception of the hedge instruments 
borrowings under our restated revolver and restated term loan mature on july  and october   respectively  and bear interest at a libor based rate 
this exposes us to risk of earnings loss due to increases in market interest rates 
to mitigate this exposure  we have entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements through december if we determine the risk may become substantial and the costs are not prohibitive  we may enter into additional interest rate swap agreements in the future 
the following table sets forth the results of commodity and interest rate swap hedging transaction settlements for the year ended december  natural gas quantity settled mmbtu increase decrease in natural gas sales revenue in thousands interest rate swaps increase in interest expense in thousands in accordance with the authoritative guidance for derivatives  all derivative instruments  not designated as a normal purchase sale  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value and changes in the fair market value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge transaction  and depending on the type of hedge transaction 
our derivative contracts are cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction 
changes in the fair market value of these derivative instruments are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified as earnings in the period s in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item 
we assess the effectiveness of hedging transactions on a quarterly basis  consistent with documented risk management strategy for the particular hedging relationship 
changes in the fair market value of the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges  if any  are included in other income expense 
as of december   our commodity and interest rate hedge positions were with counterparties that were also lenders in our credit facilities 
this allows us to secure any margin obligation resulting from a negative change in the fair market value of the derivative contracts in connection with our credit obligations and eliminate the need for independent collateral postings 
as of december   we had no deposits for collateral 

table of contents capital requirements the historical capital expenditures summary table is included in items and business and properties and is incorporated herein by reference 
our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including capitalized internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities of million  capitalized interest of million and corporate and other capital costs of million 
we have plans to carefully execute an organic capital program in that can be funded from internally generated cash flows and available cash in a per mcf and a per bbl price environment 
we also have the discretion to use our available borrowing base and proceeds from divestitures to fund capital expenditures  including acquisitions 
commitments and contingencies as is common within the industry  we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved oil and natural gas properties 
it is management s belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual obligations 
at december   the aggregate amounts of our contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows payments due by period total to to beyond in thousands senior secured revolving line of credit second lien term loan operating leases interest payments on long term debt rig commitments total contractual obligations future interest payments were calculated based on interest rates and amounts outstanding at december  asset retirement obligation 
we also had total liabilities of million related to asset retirement obligations recorded in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities at december  that are excluded from the table above 
due to the nature of these obligations  we cannot determine precisely when the payments will be made to settle these obligations
