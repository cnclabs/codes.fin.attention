item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a portfolio of internally discovered product candidates that utilize the body s natural nutrient transport mechanisms to improve the therapeutic benefits of existing drugs 
our innovative product candidates  which we refer to as transported prodrugs  are created by modifying the chemical structure of currently marketed drugs  referred to as parent drugs  and are designed to correct limitations in the oral absorption  distribution and or metabolism of the parent drug 
we intend to focus our development and commercialization efforts on potential treatments of diseases with significant unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on central nervous system  or cns  disorders 
our lead product candidate  xp gabapentin enacarbil  is licensed to astellas pharma inc in japan and five asian countries and to glaxo group limited  or gsk  in the united states and all other regions of the world 
astellas has filed a new drug application  or nda  with the pharmaceuticals and medical device agency  or pmda  for approval of xp as a treatment for restless legs syndrome in japan 
restless legs syndrome is a neurological condition that causes an irresistible urge to move the legs 
in january  gsk submitted an nda to the us food and drug administration  or fda  for us approval to market xp  known in the united states by the trade name horizant gabapentin enacarbil extended release tablets  for the treatment of moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome  or rls 
in february  gsk received a complete response letter from the fda regarding the nda for horizant for rls 
a complete response letter is issued by the fda s center of drug evaluation and research when the review of a file is completed and questions remain that preclude the approval of the nda in its current form 
the horizant complete response letter states that the fda concluded that the nda provides substantial evidence of effectiveness for horizant as a treatment for patients with rls and that the fda had not identified a clinical safety concern that would prevent approval of the mg dose of horizant 
however  a preclinical signal of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats was determined to be of sufficient concern to preclude approval of the horizant nda for rls in its current form 
in the complete response letter  the fda acknowledged that similar preclinical findings were known for gabapentin  the parent drug of horizant  at the time of the fda s approval of gabapentin for refractory epilepsy  but concluded that the seriousness and severity of refractory epilepsy and the benefit to patients provided by gabapentin justified the potential risk 
in the complete response letter  the fda also acknowledged that findings in laboratory animals are not necessarily translatable to risk in humans  and the fda noted that gabapentin products have been available for over years and do not appear to be associated with a clinical signal for pancreatic cancer based on an analysis of spontaneous reports in the fda s adverse event reporting system 
however  the fda has concluded that the absence of a finding in analyses of post marketing reports cannot be reliably interpreted as evidence of the absence of risk 
together with gsk  we will be assessing the appropriate next steps and communicating with the fda 
horizant has successfully completed several phase clinical trials for the management of post herpetic neuralgia  or phn  in the united states and is currently being evaluated as a potential prophylactic therapy for migraine headaches in a phase b clinical trial 
in addition  gsk evaluated horizant for the potential treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy  or dpn  but horizant did not show statistically significant separation from placebo in the primary endpoint of the trial 
as a consequence of the complete response letter related to the nda for rls  we believe that further development of horizant in these other indications will be delayed 
we are evaluating our second product candidate  arbaclofen placarbil  or ap previously known as xp  for the potential treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd  in patients who do not experience complete relief of gerd symptoms while being treated with proton pump inhibitors  or ppis 
we may also evaluate ap as a potential treatment for patients with spasticity 
we are evaluating our third product candidate  xp  for the potential treatment of patients with parkinson s disease 
each of our product candidates is an orally available  patented or patentable new chemical entity that addresses large potential markets 
we have entered into development and commercialization agreements with gsk for horizant and with astellas for xp and plan to enter into agreements with pharmaceutical companies for our other product candidates when access to a primary care physician sales force is necessary to maximize the commercial 
table of contents potential of our product candidates in the united states  for the development and commercialization of our product candidates outside the united states  or to develop and commercialize product candidates that fall outside our core focus 
we believe that our existing capital resources and expected milestone payments  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our current operating plan  as in effect prior to receipt of the complete response letter regarding the horizant nda  into the third quarter of however  as a result of the complete response letter  we are evaluating our operating plan and we may delay clinical development programs  decrease the scope of research and development activities and or implement expense reduction strategies in future periods 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to each of our critical accounting areas 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we have current collaboration agreements with astellas and gsk and a terminated collaboration agreement with xanodyne pharmaceuticals  inc  each of which contains multiple elements 
we account for these agreements in accordance with the provisions of the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements and collaborative arrangements topics of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or the codification 
we considered a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the various elements can be considered separate units of accounting  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements and whether there is a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 
where there are multiple deliverables combined as a single unit of accounting  revenues are deferred and recognized over the period that we remain obligated to perform services or deliver product 
the specific methodology for the recognition of the revenue eg  straight line or according to specific performance criteria is determined on a case by case basis according to the facts and circumstances applicable to a given agreement 
we account for our current revenue activities as follows up front  licensing type fees 
to date  these types of fees have been classified within the collaboration agreements as license fees  access fees  rights fees and initial licensing fees  and each of them was non refundable and payable in connection with the execution of the contract 
up front  licensing type payments are assessed to determine whether or not the licensee is able to obtain any stand alone value from the license 
where this is not the case  we do not consider the license deliverable to be a separate unit of accounting  and we defer the revenue with revenue recognition for the license fee being assessed in conjunction with the other deliverables that constitute the combined unit of accounting 
milestones 
we assess milestones on an individual basis and recognize revenue from these milestones when earned  as evidenced by acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination  or progress towards the culmination  of an earnings process and iii the milestone payment is non refundable 
where separate milestones do not meet these criteria  we use a performance based model  with revenue recognition following delivery of effort as compared to an estimate of total expected effort 
milestones that are received after all substantive deliverables have occurred are considered to be bonus payments and are recognized when earned  assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria are met 

table of contents profit and loss sharing 
this represents our share of the profits and losses from the co promotion of horizant with gsk 
amounts are recognized in the period in which the related activities occur  and their financial statement classification is based on our assessment that these activities constitute part of our ongoing central operations 
our current collaboration agreements also include potential payments for product royalties and detail reimbursements 
to date  we have not received revenues from these activities 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimate at any particular balance sheet date by any material amount 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted the provisions of the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification  which defines fair value and provides guidance for using fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities 
this topic applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
accordingly  the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  continue to be valued at fair value on a recurring basis 
this topic also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value and requires separate disclosure by level within the fair value hierarchy 
as defined in the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we apply the market approach valuation technique for fair value measurements and 
table of contents maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets and are valued at level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
stock based compensation the provisions of the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification establish accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
in accordance with the topic  for stock options  awards and stock purchase rights granted under the employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  and the resulting charge is expensed using the straight line attribution method over the vesting period 
restricted stock units are measured at the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and expensed over the period of vesting using the straight line attribution approach 
the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived  exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
both the expected stock price volatility and the weighted average expected life assumptions were determined using data obtained from similar entities  taking into consideration factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
we account for stock compensation arrangements to non employees in accordance with the equity based payments to non employees topic of the codification  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 
income taxes the recognition  derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
as of december   our total net deferred tax assets were million 
these net deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue to generate future taxable income to realize these tax assets  a full valuation allowance has been established to offset our net deferred tax assets 
additionally  the future utilization of our nol carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that could occur in the future 
if necessary  the net deferred tax assets will be reduced by any carryforwards that expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations  with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
as of december   based on the analyses performed on annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that may have occurred from inception through september  we expect to be able to use all of the nol and tax credit carryforwards before their respective expiration periods 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as costs associated with our drug discovery efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
research and development expenses are comprised of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  where a substantial portion of our 
table of contents preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  with third party manufacturing organizations  where a substantial portion of our preclinical supplies and all of our clinical supplies are produced  and with consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and amortization and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects  including our drug development programs 
we do not allocate our employee and infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
our current portfolio of proprietary product candidates includes the product candidates summarized in the table below 
the table summarizes those product candidates development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product candidate in development and the direct  third party research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product candidate 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of current phase is our current estimate of the timing of completion 
the actual timing of completion could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the our success depends substantially on our most advanced product candidates  which are still under development 
if we or our collaborative partners are unable to bring any or all of these product candidates to market  or experience significant delays in doing so  our ability to generate product revenue and our likelihood of success will be harmed  if our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could severely harm our business  we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for  or commercialize  our product candidates  and if third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost  clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates would be delayed sections of risk factors

for the year ended december   research expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs of million and office and facilities overhead costs of million 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investment in our research and development activities  including the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be critical to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of at least some of our product candidates 
in situations in which third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate  the estimated completion date is largely under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  including the uncertain effect of the compete response letter related to the horizant nda for rls  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
results of operations years ended december   and our collaboration revenue consisted of the recognition of revenues from up front and milestone payments from our collaborations with astellas and xanodyne 
our agreement with xanodyne terminated in july our net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities consisted of the recognition of revenue from up front and milestone payments and the recognition of our share of pre launch operating losses resulting from our election to co promote horizant in the united states with gsk 
as a result of our election in april of the co promotion option under our development and commercialization agreement with gsk  starting in the second quarter of  this agreement falls within the scope of the collaborative agreements topic of the codification 
as such  our revenue from the gsk collaboration agreement has been reclassified within the statements of operations for and the statements of operations now include the line item net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities  which includes all revenue resulting from our gsk collaboration agreement 
revenues that resulted from our collaboration agreements with astellas and xanodyne continue to be presented within the collaboration revenue line item

the increase in collaboration revenue in compared to was the result of a million increase in revenues recognized under our xanodyne agreement that was executed in october  partially offset by a million decrease in revenues recognized under our astellas agreement

while recognition of revenues from up front and milestone payments from our collaborations resulted in a profitable year for  we incurred net losses in and  and we continue to expect to incur losses in as we continue our research and development activities and seek to advance our product candidates into later stages of development 
as a result  we do not expect to incur income taxes in liquidity and capital resources year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above due to our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of regulatory agency approvals to sell products  we have generated cumulative operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations primarily through sales of our equity securities  non equity payments from our collaborators and interest earned on investments 
at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including investments backed by us government sponsored agencies  us treasury securities and money market accounts

we believe that our existing capital resources and expected milestone payments  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our current operating plan  as in effect prior to receipt of the complete response letter regarding the horizant nda  into the third quarter of however  as a result of the complete response letter  we are evaluating our operating plan and we may delay clinical development programs  decrease the scope of research and development activities and or implement expense reduction strategies in future periods 
we have based our estimate of cash sufficiency on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
further  our operating plan may change  and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization sooner than planned 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than potential milestones receivable under our collaborations 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and the extent to which we enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our preclinical testing  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the receipt of fda approval for horizant and the timing and success of further studies and trials necessary to secure this approval  if any  the cost of manufacturing clinical  and establishing commercial  supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the extent of product development funding under our current collaborative arrangements  the timing of any milestone payments under our collaborative arrangements  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the timing and amount of our share of operating losses from our gsk collaboration  the timing  receipt and amount of sales  profit sharing or royalties  if any  from our potential products  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are  or anticipate that we may be  unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may terminate or delay clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates  we may delay our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates or we may curtail significant drug development programs that are designed to identify new 
table of contents product candidates 
in addition  at any time upon advance notice to gsk  we may exercise the right to revert to a net sales royalty based compensation structure and forego the right to co promote horizant in the united states 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through equity financings  dilution to our stockholders would result 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii 
contractual obligations our future contractual obligations at december  were as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years greater than years operating lease obligations recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on asc update topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asc update asc update applies to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that are currently within the scope of the revenue arrangements multiple element arrangements topic of the codification 
asc update provides principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 
asc update requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price 
asc update eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method and also significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asc update should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
as a result  asc update will be effective for us no later than the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of asc update on our financial position or results of operations for future collaboration arrangements 
in january  the eitf reached a consensus on asc update topic  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures and fair value measurements  or asc update asc update requires new disclosures for significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements as well as the reasons for the transfers 
asc update also requires new disclosures for activity in level fair value measurements  such as separate information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than as one net number in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
asc update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
as a result  asc update will be effective for us no later than the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of asc update to have a material impact on either our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid investments deposited in highly rated financial institutions in the united states 
a portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because our investments are short term in duration  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we contract for the conduct of certain manufacturing activities with a contract manufacturer in europe
