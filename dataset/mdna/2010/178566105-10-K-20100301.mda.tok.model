item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our loan portfolio and our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
a portion of the income generated by our wealth management division and asset management affiliates is subject to market valuation risks 
a substantial portion of trust and investment fee income is based on equity  fixed income and other market valuations 
as a result  volatility in these markets can positively or negatively impact noninterest income 
in addition  because of the low interest rate environment  the off balance sheet money market funds managed by our wealth management business may be at a greater risk of being moved by our clients to another company or to the bank s on balance sheet money market funds 
as a result  this may have an unfavorable impact overall on our earnings 
however  this could enhance the company s overall liquidity position 
we may experience further write downs of our financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions 
market volatility  illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets have made it extremely difficult to value certain of our securities 
subsequent valuations  in light of factors then prevailing  may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods 
in addition  at the time of any sales and settlements of these securities  the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value 
any of these factors could require us to take further write downs in the value of our securities portfolio  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods 
bank clients could move their money to alternative investments causing us to lose a lower cost source of funding 
demand deposits can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments  such as those available in our wealth management business  as providing a better risk return tradeoff 
technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts offered by other financial institutions or non bank service providers 
when clients move money out of bank demand deposits and into other investments  we lose a relatively low cost source of funds  increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income 
increased competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking and wealth management services could negatively impact our business 
increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans  deposits and or assets under management 
many competitors offer the banking services and wealth management services that we offer in our service area 
these competitors  both domestic and foreign  include national  regional  and community banks 
we also face intense competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  private equity funds  mortgage banks  and other financial intermediaries 
banks  trust companies  investment advisors  mutual fund companies  multi family offices and insurance companies compete with us for trust and asset management business 
in addition  technological advances and the growth of e commerce have made it possible for non depository institutions to offer products and services that were traditionally offered only by banks 

table of contents we also face intense competition for talent 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to hire and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most businesses in which we engage can be intense 
if we are unable to attract and retain talented people  our business could suffer 
rules and regulations issued under the tarp cpp including the tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance impose restrictions on executive compensation which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain our talent 
our controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  but not absolute  assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls  and that the objectives of these controls have been met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures  and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards or tax legislation 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or elected representatives approve changes to tax laws 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
acquisition risks 
we have in the past and may in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses 
we cannot predict the frequency  size or timing of our acquisitions  and we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition until we have signed a definitive agreement 
there can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results  including results related to the total cost of integration  the time required to complete the integration  the amount of longer term cost savings  continued growth  or the overall performance of the acquired company or combined entity 
integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly 
if we are not able to integrate successfully past or future acquisitions  there is a risk that results of operations could be adversely affected 
impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets associated with acquisitions would result in a charge to earnings 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually  and amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
we may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or intangibles is determined 
operational risks 
the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization 
integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our technology and information systems  operational infrastructure  and relationships with third parties and our colleagues in our day to day and ongoing operations 
failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size  scale and scope 
this includes but is not limited to operational or systems failures  disruption of client operations and activities  ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected  as well as  the loss of key colleagues or failure on the part of key colleagues to perform properly 
negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings 
reputational risk  or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion  is inherent in our business 
negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities  including activities in our private and business banking operations and investment and trust operations  our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical 
table of contents issues  and our protection of confidential client information 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
we take steps to minimize reputation risk in the way we conduct our business activities and deal with our clients  communities and vendors 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
