polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams  as well as coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
we focus on the higher margin  higher growth markets for mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi based products for other materials across a broad range of applications 
we operate five primary polyurethanes 
table of contents manufacturing facilities in the us  europe and china 
we also operate polyurethanes formulation facilities  which are located in close proximity to our customers worldwide 
our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate  such as mdi or tdi  with polyols  which are derived largely from po and eo 
while the range of tdi based products is relatively limited  we are able to produce over  distinct mdi based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule by varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations 
as a result  polyurethane products  especially those derived from mdi  are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end use markets  including insulation in construction and appliances  cushioning for automotive and furniture  adhesives  wood binders  footwear and other specialized engineering applications 
we are a leading north american producer of po 
we and some of our customers process po into derivative products  such as polyols for polyurethane products  pg and various other chemical products 
end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings  construction  appliance  packaging  automotive and transportation  food  paints and coatings and cleaning products industries 
we also produce mtbe as a co product of our po manufacturing process 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline

also  see manufacturing and operations below and part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of material changes concerning sales of mtbe 
we sold our us butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment in june  however  the po mtbe operations in our polyurethanes segment were not included in this transaction 
in  we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china 
we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility 
in january  we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai  china 
production at our mdi finishing plant near shanghai  china operated by hps  our consolidated subsidiary  was commissioned on june  production at the mnb  aniline and crude mdi plants operated by slic  our unconsolidated joint venture  commenced on september  these world scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical chinese market and will support the significant demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience 
products and markets mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized  higher value flexible foam and coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
polyols  including polyether and polyester polyols  are used in conjunction with mdi and tdi in rigid foam  flexible foam and other 
table of contents non foam applications 
po is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols 
the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals 
graphic polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products 
depending on their needs  customers will use either commodity polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements 
by varying the blend  additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals  manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products 
mdi 
mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than tdi 
this is primarily because mdi can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications than tdi 
we believe that future growth of mdi is expected to be driven by the continued substitution of mdi based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction 
we expect that other markets  such as binders for reconstituted wood board products  specialty cushioning applications and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi 
with the recent rapid growth of the developing asian economies  the asian markets have now become the largest market for mdi 
there are four major global producers of mdi bayer  our company  basf and dow 
while there are also some regional producers in asia and europe  we believe it is unlikely that any new global producers of mdi will emerge in the foreseeable future due to the substantial requirements for entry  such as the limited availability of licenses for mdi technology and the substantial capital commitment and integration that is required to develop both the necessary technology and the infrastructure to manufacture and market mdi 
tpu 
tpu is a high quality  fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability  flexibility  strength  abrasion resistance  shock absorbency and chemical resistance 
we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific requirements of our customers 
tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries 
it is also extruded into films  wires and cables for use in a wide variety of applications in the coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 

table of contents polyols 
polyols are combined with mdi  tdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of polyurethane products 
demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown 
aniline 
aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi 
generally  most aniline is either consumed internally by the producers of the aniline or is sold to third parties under long term supply contracts 
we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive  mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long term  cost competitive aniline supply contract 
po 
po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg 
demand for po depends largely on overall economic demand  especially that of consumer durables 
the following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for po 
graphic mtbe 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
the use of mtbe is controversial  and it has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
see environmental  health and safety matters mtbe developments below and part i

we continue to sell mtbe for use as a gasoline additive  substantially all of which is sold for use outside the us see manufacturing and operations below and part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we manage a global work force which sells our polyurethane chemicals to over  customers in more than countries 
our sales and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets  as well as key end use markets which require a more global approach 
these key end use markets include the appliance  automotive  footwear  furniture and coatings  construction products  adhesives  sealants and elastomers industries 
we provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components ie  the isocyanate or the polyol or in the form of systems in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to 
table of contents our customers in ready to use form 
our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customer s needs is critical to our long term success 
we have strategically located our polyurethane formulation facilities  commonly referred to in the chemicals industry as systems houses  close to our customers  enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service 
we believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers 
we manufacture polyols primarily to support our mdi customers requirements 
we believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts  in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships  have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long term customer supply positions 
due to the specialized nature of our markets  our sales force must possess technical knowledge of our products and their applications 
our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions  quality products  reliable supply  competitive prices and superior customer service 
manufacturing and operations our mdi production facilities are located in geismar  louisiana  rozenburg  netherlands and  through our joint ventures  shanghai  china 
these facilities receive aniline  which is a primary material used in the production of mdi  from our facilities located in geismar  louisiana  wilton  uk  and shanghai  china 
we believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers 
in addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw materials  integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices 
the following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at each of our polyurethanes facilities mdi polyols tpu aniline nitrobenzene po pg mtbe millions of pounds millions of gallons geismar  louisiana osnabr ck  germany port neches  texas ringwood  illinois caojing  china rozenburg  netherlands wilton  uk total represents our share of capacity from slic  our unconsolidated chinese joint venture 
represents our approximately share of capacity under our rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation 
at both our geismar and rozenburg facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce our mdi 
this technology  which is also used in our chinese joint venture  contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer 
in addition to mdi  we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po 
we own or license all technology and know how developed and utilized at our po facility 
our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation peroxidation reactors  thereby forming tbhp and tba  which are further processed into po and mtbe  respectively 
because our po production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows all of our po co products to be processed into saleable or useable materials  we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives

in  we purchased a interest in nmg  a leading polyurethanes company headquartered in obninsk  russia 
this joint venture  now huntsman nmg  manufactures and markets a range of polyurethane systems in adhesives  coatings  elastomers and insulation using huntsman mdi products 
raw materials the primary raw materials for mdi based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po 
benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline 
historically  benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs 
we purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline  almost all of which we then use to produce mdi 
a major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po 
the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced  strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products 
the primary raw materials used in our po production process are butane isobutane  propylene  methanol and oxygen  which accounted for   and  respectively  of total raw material costs in we purchase our raw materials primarily under long term contracts 
while most of these feedstocks are commodity materials generally available to us from a wide variety of suppliers at competitive prices in the spot market  all the propylene used in the production of our po is produced internally and delivered through a pipeline connected to our po facility

table of contents our performance specialties products are organized around the following end markets coatings  polymers and resins  process additives  resources  fuels and lubricants  and agrochemicals 
amines 
amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives 
generally  amines are valued for their properties as a reactive  emulsifying  dispersant  detergent  solvent or corrosion inhibiting agent 
growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with gdp growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets 
however  certain segments of the amines market  such as polyetheramines  have grown at rates well in excess of gdp growth due to new product development  technical innovation  and substitution and replacement of competing products 
for example  polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations  enabling the customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials 
as amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer specific end use application  pricing does not generally fluctuate with movements in underlying raw materials 
morpholine dga agent 
morpholine and dga agent are produced as co products by reacting ammonia with deg 
morpholine is used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing as an accelerator and flocculants for water treatment 
dga agent is primarily used in gas treating  electronics  herbicides and metalworking end use applications 
carbonates 
ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting eo and po with carbon dioxide 
carbonates are used as solvents and as reactive diluents in polymer and coating applications 
they are also increasingly being used as a photo resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards  solar panels  lcd screens and the production of lithium batteries 
also  propylene carbonates have recently received approval by the us environmental protection agency for use as a solvent in certain agricultural applications 
we expect these solvents to replace traditional aromatic solvents that are increasingly subject to legislative restrictions and prohibitions 

table of contents performance intermediates 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our performance intermediates products product group end markets surfactants alkoxylates household detergents  industrial cleaners  anti fog chemicals for glass  asphalt emulsions  shampoos  polymerization additives  de emulsifiers for petroleum production sulfonates sulfates powdered detergents  liquid detergents  shampoos  body washes  dishwashing liquids  industrial cleaners  emulsion polymerization  concrete superplasticizers  gypsum wallboard esters and derivatives shampoo  body wash  textile and leather treatment nitrogen derivatives bleach thickeners  baby shampoo  fabric conditioners  other personal care products formulated blends household detergents  textile and leather treatment  personal care products  pharmaceutical intermediates eo po block co polymers automatic dishwasher detergents ethanolamines wood preservatives  herbicides  construction  gas treatment  metalworking lab consumer detergents  industrial and institutional detergents  synthetic lubricants eg polyester fibers and pet bottle resins  antifreeze surfactants 
surfactants or surface active agents are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule 
while surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications  they are also valued for their emulsification  foaming  dispersing  penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries 
demand growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality 
the main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved performance characteristics  which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties 
for basic surfactants  pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements 
ethanolamines 
ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia 
they are used as intermediates in the production of a variety of industrial  agricultural and consumer products 
there are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry 
growth in this sector has typically been higher than gdp and has benefited from higher demand for agrochemical products 
we believe the ethanolamines market in north america is balanced 
lab 
lab is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins 
nearly all the lab produced globally is converted into las  a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer  industrial and institutional laundry detergents 
three major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for lab in north america procter gamble  henkel and the sun products corp 
we believe that two thirds of the lab global capacity lies in the hands of seven producers  with two or three major players in each of the three 
table of contents regional markets 
although the north american market for lab is mature  we expect latin america and other developing countries to grow as detergent demand grows at a faster rate than gdp 
however  growth in demand for specialty alkylates for use in lubricants is expected to be higher than gdp 
we have developed a unique manufacturing capability for a high molecular weight alkylate for this market 
with a significant technical barrier to entry  our specialty alkylate capability has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position versus lab only producers 
eg 
we consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg meg  deg and teg 
meg is consumed primarily in the polyester fiber and bottle resin and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants  plasticizers  solvents and emulsifiers 
deg is consumed internally for the production of morpholine dga agent and polyols 
teg is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas 
we continue to optimize our eo and eg operations depending on the fundamental market demand for eg 
maleic anhydride and licensing 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our maleic anhydride products product group end markets maleic anhydride boat hulls  automotive  construction  lubricant and fuel additives  countertops  agrochemicals  paper  and food additives maleic anhydride catalyst and technology licensing maleic anhydride  bdo and its derivatives  and pbt manufacturers maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst 
the largest use of maleic anhydride in the us is in the production of uprs  which we believe account for approximately of us maleic anhydride demand 
upr is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins  which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products 
our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy efficient  high percentage recovery solvent recovery system 
this process competes against two other processes  the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery 
we believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery 
the maleic anhydride based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes  which include po  butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks 
as a result  the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst 
total us demand for maleic anhydride in was approximately million pounds 
over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is heavily influenced by construction end markets  demand for this application can be cyclical 
pricing for maleic anhydride in north america over the past several years has been increasing but has recently declined with the drop in feedstock costs 
generally  changes in price have resulted from changes in industry capacity utilization as opposed to changes in underlying raw material costs 
on april   we announced that sasol huntsman gmbh kg  our maleic anhydride joint venture located in moers  germany  would be expanding its manufacturing capacity by approximately million pounds per year 
the new capacity is expected to be available in the first 
table of contents quarter of the joint venture has received committed nonrecourse financing that together with its cash flows from operations will be used to fund the expansion 
sales and marketing we sell over  products to over  customers globally through our performance products marketing groups  which have extensive market knowledge  considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships 
our performance specialties markets are organized around end use market applications  such as coatings  polymers and resins and agrochemical 
in these end uses  our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain customer applications 
we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers 
our performance intermediates and maleic anhydride markets organize their marketing efforts around their products and geographic regions served 
we also provide extensive pre and post sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements 
finally  these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies 
in addition to our focused direct sales efforts  we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our products 
these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces 
manufacturing and operations our performance products segment has the capacity to produce more than seven billion pounds annually of a wide variety of specialty  intermediate and commodity products and formulations at manufacturing locations in north america  europe  asia and australia 
these production capacities are as follows current capacity product area north america eame apac total millions of pounds performance specialties amines carbonates specialty surfactants performance intermediates eg eo ethanolamines ethylene lab propylene surfactants maleic anhydride includes up to million pounds of ethyleneamines that are made available from dow s terneuzen  netherlands facility by way of a long term supply arrangement

on april   we announced that sasol huntsman gmbh kg would be expanding its manufacturing capacity by approximately million pounds per year 
the new capacity is expected to be available in the first quarter of and is not included in the production capacity table noted above 
our surfactants and amines facilities are located globally  with broad capabilities in amination  sulfonation and ethoxylation 
these facilities have a competitive cost base and use modern manufacturing units that allow for flexibility in production capabilities and technical innovation 
through the major restructuring of our surfactant operations  we have significantly improved the competitiveness of our surfactants business 
our primary ethylene  propylene  eo  eg and ethanolamines facilities are located in port neches  texas alongside our polyurethanes po mtbe facility 
the port neches  texas facility benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure  which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products 
our lab facility in chocolate bayou  texas and our maleic anhydride facility in pensacola  florida are both located within large  integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes operated by ascend 
we believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand alone operations 
our unconsolidated ethyleneamine joint venture is currently constructing a plant in jubail  saudi arabia 
the plant will have approximate capacity of million pounds per year with production expected early second quarter of raw materials we have the capacity to use approximately million pounds of ethylene each year produced in part at our port neches  texas facility in the production of eo and ethyleneamines 
we consume all of our eo in the manufacture of our eg  surfactants and amines products

our maleic anhydride catalyst is toll manufactured by basf under a long term contract according to our proprietary methods 
these raw materials are available from multiple sources at competitive prices 

table of contents competition in our performance specialties market  there are few competitors for many of our products due to the considerable customization of product formulations  the proprietary nature of many of our product applications and manufacturing processes and the relatively high research and development and technical costs involved 
some of our global competitors include basf  air products  dow  tosoh  and akzo 
we compete primarily on the basis of product performance  new product innovation and  to a lesser extent  on the basis of price 
there are numerous global producers of many of our performance intermediates products 
our main competitors include global companies such as dow  sasol  basf  petresa  clariant  shell  cognis  stepan and kao  as well as various smaller or more local competitors 
we compete on the basis of price with respect to the majority of our product offerings and  to a lesser degree  on the basis of product availability  performance and service with respect to certain of our more value added products

some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
pigments general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of titanium dioxide  which is a white pigment used to impart whiteness  brightness and opacity to products such as paints  plastics  paper  printing inks  fibers and ceramics 
we operate seven titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities located in north america  europe  asia and africa 
the global titanium dioxide market is characterized by a small number of large  global producers and a growing compliment of smaller regional producers 
we offer an extensive range of products  under the tioxide and deltio brand names  to approximately  customers in all major titanium dioxide end markets and geographic regions 
the geographic diversity of our manufacturing facilities allows our pigments segment to service local customers  as well as global customers that require delivery to more than one location 
our diverse customer base includes ampacet  a 
schulman  akzo nobel  basf  cabot  clariant  jotun  polyone and ppg 
our pigments business has an aggregate annual nameplate capacity of approximately  tonnes at our seven production facilities 
four of our titanium dioxide manufacturing plants are located in europe  one is in north america  one is in asia  and one is in south africa 
our north american operation consists of a interest in a manufacturing joint venture with kronos worldwide  inc our pigments segment is focused on improving our competitive position and providing customers with innovative products and solutions 
to further our competitive position we expanded our greatham  uk chloride based facility by to  tonnes per annum capacity in and  during the first quarter of  closed our grimsby  uk sulphate based facility 
we continue to pursue other projects 
table of contents to improve manufacturing costs at each of our facilities 
we are also introducing a number of innovative new products to the market  including our deltio range of free flowing pigments 
products and markets historically  global titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track global gdp growth rates 
however  the demand growth rate and its relationship with the gdp growth rate varies by region 
developed markets such as the us and western europe exhibit higher absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates  while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates 
the titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end use markets 
coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere  resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year 
there are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide  the sulfate process and the chloride process 
most recent capacity additions by the five major producers have employed the chloride process technology while those by smaller producers have generally used the sulphate process technology 
we currently believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately of global production capacity 
however  the global distribution of sulfate and chloride based titanium dioxide capacity varies by region  with the sulfate process being predominant in europe  our primary market 
the chloride process is the predominant process used in north america  and both processes are used in asia 
while most end use applications can use pigments produced by either process  regional market preferences typically favor products that are locally available 
we believe the chloride and sulfate manufacturing processes compete effectively in the marketplace 
the titanium dioxide industry currently has five major producers and a large number of small regional or local producers 
titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks and efficiency improvements 
during periods of low titanium dioxide demand  the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces production to manage working capital 
pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply demand balance 
based upon current price levels and the long lead times for planning  governmental approvals and construction  we do not expect significant additional greenfield capacity in the near future 
sales and marketing approximately of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our direct sales and technical services network  enabling us to cooperate more closely with our customers and to respond to our increasingly global customer base 
our concentrated sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve our leading market shares in a number of the countries where we manufacture titanium dioxide 
in addition  we have focused on marketing products to higher growth industries 
for example  we believe that our pigments business is well positioned to benefit from the projected growth in the plastics sector which we expect to grow faster than the overall titanium dioxide market over the next several years 

table of contents manufacturing and operations our pigments business has eight manufacturing sites in seven countries with a total capacity of approximately  tonnes per year 
approximately of our titanium dioxide capacity is located in western europe 
the following table presents information regarding our titanium dioxide facilities region site annual capacity tonnes process western europe greatham  uk  chloride calais  france  sulfate huelva  spain  sulfate scarlino  italy  sulfate north america lake charles  louisiana  chloride asia teluk kalung  malaysia  sulfate southern africa umbogintwini  south africa  sulfate total this facility is owned and operated by louisiana pigment company  lp  a manufacturing joint venture that is owned by us and by kronos worldwide 
the capacity shown reflects our interest in louisiana pigment company lp in  we completed the expansion of our greatham  uk facility by  tonnes 
we are also well positioned to selectively invest in new plant capacity based upon our icon chloride technology 
icon technology allows for the construction of new capacity with world scale economics at a minimum nameplate size of  tonnes 
we believe competing chloride technologies typically require a minimum capacity of  tonnes to achieve comparable economics 
our chloride additions can be more easily absorbed into the market  which provides higher investment returns than larger capacity additions 
during the first quarter of  we closed our grimsby  uk sulphate based manufacturing facility 
joint venture we own a interest in louisiana pigment company lp  a manufacturing joint venture located in lake charles  louisiana 
the remaining interest is held by our joint venture partner  kronos worldwide 
we share production offtake and operating costs of the plant equally with kronos worldwide  though we market our share of the production independently 
the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation 
our investment in louisiana pigment company lp is accounted for using the equity method 
raw materials the primary raw materials used to produce titanium dioxide are titanium bearing ores 
we purchase the majority of our ore under long term supply contracts with a number of ore suppliers 
the majority of titanium bearing ores are sourced from australia  south africa and canada 
ore accounts for approximately of pigment variable manufacturing costs  while utilities electricity  gas and steam  sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately of our variable manufacturing costs 

table of contents the world market for titanium bearing ores is characterized by a small number of large suppliers rio tinto  iluka and exxaro which account for approximately of global supply and from which we purchase approximately of our needs 
however  the choice of producers has increased in recent years with a number of emerging suppliers based in india and africa and we have broadened our supply base by purchasing increasing amounts of our ores from these suppliers 
over of our ore purchases are made under agreements with terms of three or more years 
titanium dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process 
once an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced  it is finished into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end use applications 
the finishing process is common to both the sulfate and chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product s performance characteristics 
the sulfate process generally uses less refined ores that are cheaper to purchase but produce more co product than the chloride process 
co products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations 
in order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness  we have developed and marketed the co products of our pigments business 
we sell over of the co products generated by our business 
competition the global markets in which our pigments business operates are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price 
in addition  we also compete on the basis of product quality and service 
the major global producers against whom we compete are dupont  tronox  kronos and cristal  each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets 
some of our competitors may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
moreover  the sulphate based titanium dioxide technology used by our pigments business is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing

under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  and similar state laws  a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred  and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release 
we have been notified by third parties of claims against us for cleanup liabilities at approximately former facilities or third party sites  including  but not limited to  sites listed under cercla 
based on current information and past experiences at other cercla sites  we do not expect any of these third party claims to result in material liability to us 
outside the us  analogous contaminated property laws  such as those in effect in france and australia  can hold past owners and or operators liable for remediation at former facilities 
in addition  under the us resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended rcra  and similar state laws  we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit 
some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use  including on site waste disposal 
we are aware of soil  groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites  and we 
table of contents may find contamination at other sites in the future 
for example  our port neches  texas  and geismar  louisiana  facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements under rcra authority 
similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate manufacturing facilities  such as australia  switzerland  and italy 
in june of  an agreement was reached between the local regulatory authorities and our advanced materials site in pamplona  spain to relocate our manufacturing operations in order to facilitate new urban development desired by the city 
subsequently  as required by the authorities  soil and groundwater sampling was performed and followed by a quantitative risk assessment 
although unresolved at this time  some level of remediation of site contamination may be required in the future  but the estimated cost is unknown because the remediation approach and timing has not been determined 
by letter dated march   our base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray  australia  was issued a clean up notice by the australian victorian epa due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site 
the agency revoked the original clean up notice on september  and issued a revised clean up notice due to the complexity of contamination issues at the site 
on march   we submitted the required site remediation action plan to the agency which proposed additional investigation and remediation method trials 
we can provide no assurance that the epa will agree with our proposed plan  will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be associated with the clean up 
additionally  on september   we announced a decision to close this facility in early in the third quarter of  we recorded a million liability related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site 
in many cases  our potential liability arising from historical contamination is based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility 
in these situations  we frequently obtained an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre closing conditions 
we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and  where applicable  mitigated our ultimate remediation liability 
we cannot assure you  however  that all of such matters will be subject to indemnity  that the prior owner will honor its indemnity or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters 
based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available  we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if such indemnities are unavailable or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs  and if such costs are material  then such expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at the current time  we are unable to estimate the full cost  exclusive of indemnification benefits  to remediate any of the known contamination sites 
environmental reserves we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations  site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties 
liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our liability estimates are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators  available facts  existing technology and past experience 
the environmental liabilities do not include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations 
we had accrued million and million for environmental liabilities as of december  and  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively  and 
table of contents million and million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively 
in certain cases  our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to years 
we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued  however  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess 
regulatory developments in december  the eu parliament and eu council approved a new eu regulatory framework for chemicals called reach registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals 
reach took effect on june   and the program it establishes will be phased in over years 
under the regulation  companies that manufacture in or import into the european economic area eea more than one metric tonne of a chemical substance per year will be required to register such chemical substances and isolated intermediates in a central database 
use authorizations will be granted for a specific chemical if the applicants can show that the risks in using the chemical are adequately controlled  and for chemicals where there are no suitable alternatives substances or technologies available and the applicant can demonstrate that the social and economic benefits of using the chemical outweigh the risks 
in addition  specified uses of some hazardous substances may be restricted 
furthermore  all applicants will have to study the availability of alternative chemicals 
if an alternative is available  an applicant will have to submit a substitution plan to the regulatory agency 
the regulatory agency will only authorize persistent bio accumulative and toxic substances if an alternative chemical is not available 
the registration  evaluation and authorization phases of the program will require expenditures and resource commitments in order to  for example  participate in mandatory data sharing forums  acquire  generate and evaluate data  prepare and submit dossiers for substance registration  obtain legal advice and reformulate products  if necessary 
we have established a cross business european reach team that is working closely with our businesses to identify and list all substances we purchase or manufacture in  or import into  the eea 
our pre registration reach compliance began on june   utilizing internal resources at nominal expense and we met all chemical pre registration requirements by the november  regulatory deadline 
we are currently proceeding with the registration of the high volume and high priority chemicals under the program  which must be registered no later than november  although the total long term cost for reach compliance is not estimable at this time  we spent approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on reach compliance 
greenhouse gas regulation in the eu and other jurisdictions committed to compliance with the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change the kyoto protocol  there is an increasing likelihood that our manufacturing sites will be affected in some way over the next few years by regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
for example  australia recently proposed its carbon pollution reduction scheme  which may impact our australian operations  and program implementation is currently scheduled for in addition  although the us is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol  several states are implementing their own ghg regulatory programs and a federal program in the us is likely for the future 
draft us federal legislation and the recent us epa clean air act endangerment findings for carbon dioxide have focused corporate attention on the eventuality of measuring and reporting of ghg emissions for operations in the us the us epa also recently mandated ghg reporting requirements for us sources in excess of  tons beginning in final details of a comprehensive us ghg management approach is  as yet  uncertain 
nevertheless  we are already managing and reporting ghg emissions  to varying degrees  as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and or eu emissions trading scheme requirements 
although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation  few have 
table of contents experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result  although it is likely that ghg emission restrictions will increase over time 
potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets used to meet ghg restriction and or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation  as well as direct compliance costs 
currently  however  it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites 
chemical facility anti terrorism rulemaking the department of homeland security dhs issued the final rule of their chemical facility anti terrorism standard in the initial phase of the rule required all chemical facilities in the us to evaluate their facilities against the dhs appendix a list of chemicals of interest 
facilities which have specified chemicals in designated quantities on the appendix a list were required to submit a top screen to dhs in a top screen is a questionnaire completed by a facility having chemicals of interest in designated threshold quantities 
in early  we submitted top screens for all of our covered facilities 
after reviewing the top screens  dhs determined that some of our sites were high risk facilities 
as a result  we were required to perform security vulnerability assessments at the high risk sites 
the security vulnerability assessments were completed and sent to dhs during the fourth quarter of based on their assessment of the security vulnerability assessments  we received notice from dhs that one of our sites was elevated to a higher security tier 
the dhs determined the other three sites to be low security tiers 
the three sites will be required to develop site security plans based on a list of risk based performance standards  but security improvements recommended from the site security plans are not anticipated to be material 
we believe that security upgrades to the tier elevated site will be required  however we do not know what these required updates will be and thus cannot reasonably estimate associated costs at this time  but they could be material 
additionally  on november   the transportation safety administration of the dhs published a final rule regarding rail security sensitive materials that are received at or shipped from facilities 
we have three sites that are subject to this new rule  but at this time do not anticipate that the costs to comply will be material 
mtbe developments we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs 
because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies  its use has become controversial in the us and elsewhere  and its use has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
we currently market mtbe  either directly or through third parties  to gasoline additive customers located outside the us  although there are additional costs associated with such outside us sales  which may result in decreased profitability compared to historical sales in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tertiary butyl alcohol to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe 
numerous companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in more than cases in us courts that allege mtbe contamination in groundwater 
many of these cases were settled after the parties engaged in mediation supervised by a court appointed special settlement master 
beginning in march and continuing through june   we have been named as a defendant in of these lawsuits pending in new york state and federal courts 
for more information  see item legal proceedings mtbe litigation 
the plaintiffs in the mtbe groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages  punitive damages  injunctive relief  such as monitoring and abatement  and attorney fees 

table of contents while we currently have insufficient information to meaningfully assess our potential exposure in these cases  we have joined with a larger group of defendants in an effort to mediate the plaintiffs claims 
mediation in late and early was unsuccessful 
a further mediation session was held february  which resulted in a tentative settlement in each of the cases in which we have been named 
our allocated portion of the total settlement amount is not material and we have accrued a liability for the claims equal to our allocated portion of the settlement 
it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in additional existing or future mtbe contamination cases 
we cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in existing or future mtbe contamination cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position

risk factors any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our business our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with declining economic conditions 
our financial results are substantially dependent upon overall economic conditions in the united states  the european union and asia 
declining economic conditions in all or any of these locations or negative perceptions about economic conditions could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business 
indeed  as a result of the current economic downturn  we have experienced decreased demand for many of our products 
uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it difficult for us  our customers and our suppliers to forecast demand trends 
renewed declines in demand would place additional pressure on our results of operations 
the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time 
as a consequence  at present  we are unable to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations  and we can give no assurances as to the timing  extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the chemical industry 
significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers  which could reduce our profitability 
the prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile 
we purchase a substantial portion of these raw materials from third party suppliers  and  following the dispositions of our base chemicals and polymers businesses in and  respectively  our purchases of certain products from third party suppliers have significantly increased 
the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow price trends of  and vary with market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas feedstocks  which are highly volatile and cyclical 
the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are generally commodity products that are readily available at market prices 
we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers  but disruptions of existing supply arrangements could substantially impact our profitability 
if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements  we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs 
in addition  if any of the raw materials that we use become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced  then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes 
any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues  which could reduce our cash flow 

table of contents our supply agreements typically provide for market based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility 
while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases  we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all 
timing differences between raw material prices  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow 
any cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
financial difficulties and related problems at our customers  vendors  suppliers and other business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the recent economic downturn has caused financial problems at some customers  vendors  suppliers and business partners 
we rely on numerous vendors and suppliers and collaborations with other industry participants to provide us with chemicals  feedstocks and other raw materials  along with energy sources and  in certain cases  facilities  that we need to operate our business 
if the economic downturn were to continue or worsen  some of these companies may be forced to reduce their output  shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection 
if this were to occur  it could materially adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials  energy sources or facilities that we need  which could disrupt our operations  including the production of certain of our products 
in addition  it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 
in addition  if the economic downturn were to continue or worsen  some of our customers may experience financial difficulties  including bankruptcies  restructurings and liquidations  which could affect our business by reducing sales  increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by our significant leverage  which could restrict our ability to grow our businesses 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding 
as of december   we had total consolidated outstanding indebtedness of approximately  million including the current portion of long term debt and a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 
this balance does not reflect approximately million under our us accounts receivable securitization program us a r program and our european accounts receivable securitization program eu a r program  and  collectively with the us a r program  our a r program or a r programs at december  our outstanding debt could have important consequences for our businesses  including the following a high degree of debt makes us more vulnerable to the current downturn in our businesses  our industry and the economy in general  as a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations will be required to make payments on our indebtedness  making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions  a substantial portion of our future cash flow from operations may be required to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  including the growth of our businesses  our ability to obtain additional financing may be constrained due to our existing level of debt  particularly in the current credit environment  and 
table of contents part of our indebtedness is  and any future debt may be  subject to variable interest rates  which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
we require substantial capital to finance our operations and continued growth  and we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time for a variety of purposes  including acquiring additional businesses 
however  our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants 
among other things  these covenants limit or prohibit our ability to incur more debt  make prepayments of other debt  pay dividends  redeem stock or make other distributions  issue capital stock  make investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  merge or consolidate  and transfer or sell assets 
our debt instruments also require us to comply with certain financial covenants under certain circumstances 
for example  after entering into a waiver on april   the leverage covenant applicable to our million revolving facility the revolving facility under our senior secured credit facilities the senior credit facilities requires us to maintain a maximum senior secured debt to ebitda ratio of to when loans or letters of credit are outstanding under the revolving facility 
we may consent to terminating the waiver in conjunction with a proposed amendment to the revolving facility that we are currently seeking 
in that event  the required maximum senior secured debt to ebitda ratio would return to to 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenant 
however  if we violate this covenant  it could lead to an event of default under the senior credit facilities  which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and result in a loss of such facilities 
given the current credit environment  it may not be possible for us to replace the senior credit facilities with a substitute facility on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also must comply with certain financial covenants under our million us a r program and our million approximately million eu a r program 
failure to meet such covenants could lead to an event of default and could require us to cease use of such facilities  thus prohibiting us from borrowing against our receivables 
a default under our a r programs would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and result in a loss of such facilities 
in summary  if debt under one or more of our facilities is accelerated  cross default provisions in our debt instruments would likely be triggered  which would likely have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
also  if we undergo a change of control  our debt instruments may require us to make an offer to purchase certain of our notes 
under these circumstances  we may also be required to repay indebtedness under our senior credit facilities prior to our notes 
in this event  we may not have the financial resources necessary to purchase such notes  which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing such notes 
as of december   the current portion of our long term debt to affiliates totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had combined outstanding variable rate borrowings of approximately billion 
assuming a increase in interest rates  without giving effect to any interest rate hedges or our cash balances  our annual interest rate expense would increase by approximately million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to meet payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under the terms of those instruments 
in the event of a default  a holder of the indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest  the creditors under our senior credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder  and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may not be able to obtain funding because of the deterioration of the credit and capital markets 
this may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs and from refinancing our existing indebtedness when it comes due 
global financial markets and economic conditions continue to be volatile  which has resulted in substantial deterioration in the credit and capital markets 
these conditions  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector and the re pricing of credit risk  may make it difficult to obtain funding for our ongoing capital needs 
in particular  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms that are similar to existing debt  and reduced  or in some cases ceased  to provide funding to borrowers 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that additional funding for our capital needs from credit and capital markets will be available if needed and  to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
in addition  we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness when it comes due on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if we cannot meet our capital needs or refinance our existing indebtedness  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
a downgrade in the ratings of the securities of our company or our subsidiaries could result in increased interest and other financial expenses related to future borrowings of our company or our subsidiaries and could restrict our access to additional capital or trade credit 
standard and poor s ratings services and moody s investors service maintain credit ratings for our company 
each of these ratings is currently below investment grade 
any decision by these or other ratings agencies to downgrade such ratings in the future could result in increased interest and other financial expenses relating to our future borrowings and could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms 
in addition  any downgrade could restrict our access to  and negatively impact the terms of  trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials 
the industries in which we compete are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
among our competitors are some of the world s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources 
changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our leadership position in various products and markets throughout the world 
in addition  some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
furthermore  some of our competitors have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
while we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes  to improve and refine existing products and processes  and to develop new applications for existing products  the failure to develop new products  processes or applications could make us less competitive 
moreover  if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
in addition  certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  may be low in certain product segments of our business  and 
table of contents the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing 
further  petroleum rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand this role significantly in the future 
increased competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products  which could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
future acquisitions  partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and or result in unanticipated adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
in the future we may seek to grow by making acquisitions or entering into partnerships and joint ventures 
any future acquisition  partnership or joint venture may require that we make a significant cash investment  issue stock or incur substantial debt 
in addition  acquisitions  partnerships or investments may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
these capital  equity and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our businesses 
any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks  including the inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  increased operating costs  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  and difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings 
we have incurred indebtedness to finance past acquisitions 
we may finance future acquisitions with additional indebtedness 
we could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness  such as reducing our liquidity and access to financial markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  legal restrictions and taxes 
we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the us  and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with international operations 
these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services  which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates 
in addition  we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer us dollars 
because we currently have significant operations located outside the us  we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements 
other risks of international operations include trade barriers  tariffs  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  social and political risks  general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of us and foreign laws  including tax laws 
furthermore  in foreign jurisdictions where process of law may vary from country to country  we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements 
in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices may vary  we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems 
the occurrence of these risks  among others  could 
table of contents disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries  which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us 
we operate in a significant number of jurisdictions  which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate 
in addition  generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap or us gaap has required us to place valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a significant number of tax jurisdictions 
these valuation allowances result from a cumulative history of pre tax operating losses in specific tax jurisdictions 
valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate 
economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of the current valuation allowances and potentially the establishment of new valuation allowances 
while significant valuation allowances remain  our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations 
the current administration has announced several proposals to reform us tax laws  including a proposal to further limit foreign tax credits and a proposal to defer tax deductions allocable to non us earnings until earnings are repatriated 
it is unclear whether these proposed changes will be enacted  or  if enacted  what the scope of the reforms will be 
depending on their content  such reforms  if enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
demand for many of our products is cyclical  and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products 
historically  the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods of capacity additions  resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins 
the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes in the supply and demand for products  changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 
this cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle 
natural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses 
any serious disruption at any of our facilities due to hurricane  fire  earthquake  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or man made disaster could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses 
if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of these facilities  it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  many of our current and potential customers are concentrated in specific geographic areas 
a disaster in one of these regions could have a material adverse impact on our operations  operating results and financial condition 
while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business  we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from all such disasters or events that might result due to climate change 
in addition  insurance may not adequately compensate us from any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters 
furthermore  in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters  insurance may become increasingly expensive or not at all available 
our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs  which could reduce our profitability 
although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of differentiated and commodity chemical products 
these hazards include chemical spills  pipeline leaks 
table of contents and ruptures  storage tank leaks  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing  processing  handling  transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals 
we are also potentially subject to other hazards  including natural disasters and severe weather  explosions and fires  transportation problems  including interruptions  spills and leaks  mechanical failures  unscheduled downtimes  labor difficulties  remediation complications  and other risks 
many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 
furthermore  we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure  exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby  workers compensation and other matters 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices  but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business 
we maintain property damage and business interruption insurance policies and products liability insurance policies  as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks  including pollution legal liability insurance 
each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions  deductibles and coverage limits  in accordance with industry standards and practices 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business 
we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings 
it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others in which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
we are subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  protection of the environment and human health  and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations  substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as  under some environmental laws  the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
continually increasing concerns regarding the safety of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment constitute a growing trend 
governmental  regulatory and societal demands for continuously increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in continued pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry 
in addition  these concerns could influence public perceptions  the viability of certain products  our reputation  the cost to comply with regulations  and the ability to attract and retain employees 
moreover  changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations  or require us to modify our facilities or operations 
accordingly  environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental or safety laws 
capital expenditures and costs relating to environmental or safety matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations 
capital expenditures and costs 
table of contents beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future environmental or safety laws 
furthermore  we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre dated our purchase of our businesses 
we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future environmental laws 
existing or future litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability  materially reduce our sales and or materially increase our costs 
we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs 
because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies  its use has become controversial in the us and elsewhere  and its use has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
we currently market mtbe  either directly or through third parties  to gasoline additive customers located outside the us  although there are additional costs associated with such outside us sales which may result in decreased profitability compared to historical sales in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tertiary butyl alcohol to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe 
numerous companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in more than cases in us courts that allege mtbe contamination in groundwater 
many of these cases were settled after the parties engaged in mediation supervised by a court appointed special settlement master 
beginning in march and continuing through june   we have been named as a defendant in of these lawsuits pending in new york state and federal courts 
for more information  see item legal proceedings mtbe litigation 
the plaintiffs in the mtbe groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages  punitive damages  injunctive relief  such as monitoring and abatement  and attorney fees 
while we currently have insufficient information to meaningfully assess our potential exposure in these cases  we have joined with a larger group of defendants in an effort to mediate the plaintiffs claims 
mediation in late and early was unsuccessful 
a further mediation session was held february  which resulted in a tentative settlement in each of the cases in which we have been named 
our allocated portion of the total settlement amount is not material and we have accrued a liability for the claims equal to our allocated portion of the settlement 
it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in additional existing or future mtbe contamination cases 
we cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in existing or future mtbe contamination cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders  impeding the manufacture or shipment of products  processing transactions and reporting financial results  resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information  or damage to our reputation 
while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures  there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

table of contents our business is dependent on our intellectual property 
if our patents are declared invalid or our trade secrets become known to our competitors  our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
proprietary protection of our processes  apparatuses and other technology is important to our business 
consequently  we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights 
while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the us  there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property  then our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
additionally  our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  these confidentiality agreements may be breached  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know how  or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know how 
in addition  others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets or proprietary know how could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
loss of key members of our management could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of our senior executives and other key members of management 
if any of these individuals resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced  our business operations and our ability to implement our growth strategies could be materially disrupted 
we generally do not have employment agreements with  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance for  any of our executive officers 
conflicts  military actions  terrorist attacks and general instability throughout the world  and in particular in certain energy producing nations  along with increased security regulations related to our industry  could adversely affect our business 
conflicts  military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated global economic instability and turmoil in world financial markets 
current regional tensions and conflicts in energy producing nations  including continuing instability in iran  ongoing military action in iraq  and other conflicts have caused  and may cause further  increases in raw material costs  particularly natural gas and crude oil based feedstocks  which are used in our operations 
the uncertainty surrounding the threat of further armed hostilities  military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  europe  australia  asia  africa  south america and the middle east  or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  the resulting economic disruption caused by such events may result in reduced demand from our customers for our products 
a military action or terrorist attack that impacts any of our facilities  or the facilities of our suppliers or customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  a number of governments have begun regulatory processes that could lead to new regulations impacting the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals  which could result in higher operating costs 
these developments will subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  
table of contents depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us  then we will not be able to make payment on our debts 
our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and our guarantor subsidiaries 
because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by non guarantor subsidiaries  our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness  including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity  are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such non guarantor subsidiaries 
any payment of dividends  distributions  loans or advances by our non guarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law  monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate  and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our non guarantor subsidiaries 
in addition  payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and  except for our guarantor subsidiaries  have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds available for those amounts  whether by dividends  loans  distributions or other payments  and do not guarantee the payment of interest on  or principal of  our debt 
any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary  and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets  will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary 
climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us  climate change mitigation programs and regulation could significantly increase our costs 
energy costs are a significant component of our overall costs  and climate change regulation may result in significant increases in energy costs 
specifically  our costs could increase if energy companies pass on increased costs to their customers  such as costs resulting from carbon taxes  emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards

table of contents risks related to our common stock and debt securities our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of issues  including broad market factors that may have a material adverse impact on our stock price  regardless of actual performance 
the following factors could affect our stock price periodic variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of our business or that of our competitors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates of our future operating results or of the future operating results of our competitors  material announcements by us or our competitors  public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  and adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends or in conditions or trends in the markets in which we operate 
shares available for future sale may cause our common stock price to decline  which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
sales of substantial numbers of additional shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may cause prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock to decline 
we have the ability to issue additional equity securities  which would lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional equity securities would result in dilution of then existing stockholders equity interests in us 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine  with respect to any series of preferred stock  the number of shares in that series and the terms  rights and limitations of that series 
if we issue convertible notes or convertible preferred stock  a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders interest 
our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such convertible instruments  but reserves the right to do so in the future 
in addition  we may issue additional shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans 
certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value 
certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board of directors  limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if some of our stockholders considered such a change of control to be beneficial 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
therefore  our board of directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us  which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value

table of contents item legal proceedings discoloration claims certain claims have been filed against us relating to discoloration of unplasticized polyvinyl chloride products allegedly caused by our titanium dioxide discoloration claims 
substantially all of the titanium dioxide that is the subject of these claims was manufactured prior to our acquisition of the titanium dioxide business from ici in net of amounts we have received from insurers and pursuant to contracts of indemnity  we have paid an aggregate of approximately million in costs and settlement amounts for discoloration claims through december  during the year ended december   we settled one discoloration claim for which we were fully indemnified 
during the year ended december   we paid an insignificant amount in partial settlement of a claim 
the one remaining discoloration claim unresolved as of december  asserted aggregate damages of approximately million approximately million 
an appropriate liability has been accrued for this claim 
based on our understanding of the merits of this claim and our rights under contracts of indemnity and insurance  we do not believe that the net impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity will be material 
in addition  while we can give no assurance that additional discoloration claims will not be made in the future  we believe such claims are unlikely 
if additional discoloration claims were to be made  we have rights under contract to indemnity  including from ici  and therefore do not believe such claims would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
based on this conclusion and our inability to reasonably estimate our expected costs with respect to these unasserted claims  we have made no accruals in our financial statements as of december  for costs associated with unasserted discoloration claims 
environmental enforcement proceedings on occasion  we receive notices of violation  enforcement or other complaints from regulatory agencies alleging non compliance with applicable ehs laws

the environmental agency is investigating a possible prosecution against northumbrian water and or us for the breach 
northumbrian water has threatened to prosecute our subsidiary in the uk to date  however  no charges have been filed 
asbestos litigation we have been named as a premises defendant in a number of asbestos exposure cases  typically claims by non employees of exposure to asbestos while at a facility 
in the past  these cases typically have involved multiple plaintiffs bringing actions against multiple defendants  and the complaints have not indicated which plaintiffs were making claims against which defendants  where or how the alleged injuries occurred or what injuries each plaintiff claimed 
these facts  which would be central to any estimate of probable loss  generally have been learned only through discovery 
where a claimant s alleged exposure occurred prior to our ownership of the relevant premises  the prior owners generally have contractually agreed to retain liability for  and to indemnify us against  asbestos exposure claims 
this indemnification is not subject to any time or dollar amount limitations 

table of contents upon service of a complaint in one of these cases  we tender it to the prior owner 
none of the complaints in these cases state the amount of damages being sought 
the prior owner accepts responsibility for the conduct of the defense of the cases and payment of any amounts due to the claimants 
in our fourteen year experience with tendering these cases  we have not made any payment with respect to any tendered asbestos cases 
we believe that the prior owners have the intention and ability to continue to honor their indemnity obligations  although we cannot assure you that they will continue to do so or that we will not be liable for these cases if they do not

year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  unresolved at beginning of period tendered during period resolved during period unresolved at end of period although the indemnifying party informs us when tendered cases have been resolved  it generally does not inform us of the settlement amounts relating to such cases  if any 
the indemnifying party has informed us that it typically manages our defense together with the defense of other entities in such cases and resolves claims involving multiple defendants simultaneously  and that it considers the allocation of settlement amounts  if any  among defendants to be confidential and proprietary 
consequently  we are not able to provide the number of cases resolved with payment by the indemnifying party or the amount of such payments 
we have never made any payments with respect to these cases 
as of december   we had an accrued liability of million relating to these cases and a corresponding receivable of million relating to our indemnity protection with respect to these cases 
we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss in excess of our accruals 
additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future  and such claims could be material 
however  because we are not able to estimate the amount or range of losses associated with such claims  we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december  certain cases in which we are a premises defendant are not subject to indemnification by prior owners or operators

these cases are consolidated as the polyether polyols cases in multidistrict litigation known as in re urethane antitrust litigation  mdl no

md jwl djw  pending in the united states district court  district of kansas 
the kansas court has ruled that plaintiffs may prosecute the polyether polyols cases on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyether polyol products in the united states 
bayer has entered into a settlement with the plaintiffs class and has been dismissed as a defendant 
merits discovery is underway  and trial has been set for may  we and the other polyether polyol defendants excluding bayer have also been named as defendants in two civil antitrust suits brought by certain direct purchasers of polyether polyol products that opted out of the class certified in mdl no 
these cases have been brought by groups of affiliated companies  plaintiffs in all  who allege that between and inclusive the polyether polyol defendants conspired to fix the prices of polyether polyol products sold in the us and abroad in violation of the sherman act  similar laws of several us states  and the laws of the european union and certain of its member states 
we and the other defendants moved to dismiss the opt out complaints 
the court partially granted the motion to dismiss state law claims and the claims outside the class period 
subsequently  the plaintiffs filed amended complaints and we and the other defendants again filed motions to dismiss their claims outside the class period 
on january   the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss claims under the laws of the european union and its member states  but denied our motion to limit the opt out claims to the class period 
on november   another group of four direct purchasers that opted out of the class certified in mdl no 
filed an action in the united states district court  district for new jersey making nearly identical claims as those made by the other direct purchasers 
we expect that it will be consolidated for discovery purposes with the other direct actions in mdl no 
along with flexsys  crompton now chemtura  uniroyal  rhein chemie rheinau  and the other polyether polyol defendants  we also have been named as a defendant in a civil antitrust suit pending in the superior court of california  county of san francisco  filed on february   that alleges that between and the defendants conspired to fix the prices of certain rubber and urethane products sold in california in violation of antitrust and unfair competition laws of california 
this case purports to be brought on behalf of a class of all california purchasers of products containing rubber and urethanes products 
by agreement of the parties this case has been stayed pending the resolution of mdl no 
along with dow  basf  and lyondell  we have also been named as a defendant in a third amended complaint proposed for filing in an existing civil antitrust suit pending against bayer and chemtura in federal district court in massachusetts 
the proposed amended complaint alleges that beginning around we and the other defendants conspired to fix the prices of mdi  tdi  polyether polyols  and polyester polyols sold throughout the united states in violation of the federal sherman act and the laws of various states 
the proposed amended complaint seeks to sue on behalf of all 
table of contents indirect purchasers of such products in the united states 
the massachusetts action has been stayed pending plaintiffs settlement of the previously asserted claims against bayer and chemtura 
we have filed papers opposing the motion for leave to file the proposed amended complaint adding us as a defendant in that action 
the plaintiffs pleadings in these various antitrust suits provide few specifics about any alleged illegal conduct on our part  and we are not aware of any illegal conduct by us or any of our employees 
for these reasons  we cannot estimate the possibility of loss or range of loss relating to these claims  and therefore we have not accrued a liability for these claims 
nevertheless  we could incur losses due to these claims in the future and those losses could be material 
huntsman international has been named as a defendant in a purported class action civil antitrust suit alleging that it and its co defendants and other co conspirators conspired to fix the prices at which titanium dioxide was sold in the us between at least march  and the present

mtbe litigation we are named as a defendant in lawsuits pending in litigation filed between march  and june  in new york federal and state courts alleging liability related to mtbe contamination in groundwater 
numerous other companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  were named as defendants in these and many other cases that were pending in us courts 
the plaintiffs in the cases in which we are named are municipal water districts  a regional water supply authority  and municipal corporations that claim that defendants conduct has caused mtbe contamination of their groundwater 
four cases are pending in the us district court for the southern district of new york and are pending in the supreme court of the state of new york  nine in nassau county and five in suffolk county 
the plaintiffs seek injunctive relief  such as monitoring and abatement  compensatory damages  punitive damages and attorney fees 
together with other defendants  we have filed motions to dismiss all of the state court cases 
at this time  while we currently have insufficient information to meaningfully assess our potential exposure in these cases  we have joined with a larger group of defendants in an effort to mediate the plaintiffs claims 
mediation in late and early was unsuccessful 
a further mediation session was held february  and resulted in a tentative settlement in each of the cases in which we have been named 
our allocated portion of the total settlement amount is not material 
we have accrued a liability for these claims equal to our allocated portion of the settlement

the lawsuits sought to enjoin the stockholder vote on the merger 

table of contents on september   the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs counsel in the delaware and texas actions to settle these four lawsuits 
as part of the proposed settlement  the defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing  but we agreed to make certain additional disclosures in the final proxy statement that was mailed to our stockholders on or about september  in connection with the settlement  the parties also reached an agreement with respect to any application that the plaintiffs counsel will make for an award of customary attorneys fees and expenses to be paid following the completion of the merger 
the memorandum of understanding is now null and void and of no force and effect because the merger was not consummated 
the texas action has been voluntarily dismissed  but there has been no further developments in the delaware actions at this time 
port arthur plant fire insurance litigation on august   an action was brought against our company and international risk insurance company iric  our captive insurer  in the united states district court for the southern district of texas  by seventeen reinsurance companies the reinsurers that reinsure risks under the property insurance policy issued by iric to our company the policy for the period covering the april  fire at our manufacturing facility in port arthur  texas

on september   the court denied motions to dismiss filed by our company and iric  ordering the parties to engage in a short period of discovery on the issue of arbitrability 
in a second and related action filed by our company against iric in state court in jefferson county  texas  iric filed a third party petition against the reinsurers  who then removed that action to the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
some of the reinsurers filed answers and motions to compel arbitration  to stay these proceedings  and to change venue to the united states district court for the southern district of texas in order to consolidate the two actions 
we filed a motion to remand that action to the state court and opposition to the reinsurers motions in that action 
on april   the united states district court for the eastern district of texas transferred the case to the united states district court for the southern district of texas 
on september   the court denied our motion to remand that suit to the state court in which it was filed 
pursuant to a december  agreement among the parties to the actions referenced above a mediation was scheduled for february   if the disputes were not fully resolved in mediation  the parties would submit all coverage and quantum issues to a three arbitrator panel in the second half of  with a binding award to be entered by september  see current status in paragraph below  the reinsurers paid an additional million on our claim on december  and agreed that all monies paid by the participating reinsurers on the claim to date are nonrefundable  we waived our noncontractual claims against the reinsurers  the first action referenced above is stayed pending final resolution and entry of judgment  and the second action referenced above has been dismissed 
because the non binding mediation was not successful  we and the reinsurers are now participating in binding arbitration which began on november  the binding arbitration is ongoing and further oral arguments have been scheduled in march reinsurers responsible for a small percentage of our remaining claim were not parties to the two lawsuits and are not parties to the agreement  thus we may need to pursue actions against them separately for their pro rata shares of the unpaid claim 
we have paid our deductible on the claim of million and have been paid million to date by the reinsurers 
prior to the commencement of the arbitration proceedings  we had claimed an additional approximately million plus interest as presently due and owing and unpaid under the policy for losses caused by the fire 
the arbitration panel has made a preliminary ruling disallowing our claim for interest 
in addition  the arbitration panel has made certain preliminary 
table of contents rulings on some of the discrete issues that so far effectively reduce the overall amount we have claimed by approximately million 
a final ruling on these and the various other outstanding issues under the claim are not expected until after the oral arguments scheduled in march for more information  see note casualty losses and insurance recoveries port arthur  texas plant fire to our consolidated financial statements 
other proceedings we are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs  governmental authorities and others arising under provisions of applicable laws  including various environmental  products liability and other laws

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products 
our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations  which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers 
our products are used in a wide range of applications  including those in the adhesives  aerospace  automotive  construction products  durable and non durable consumer products  electronics  medical  packaging  paints and coatings  power generation  refining  synthetic fiber  textile chemicals and dye industries 
we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines  including mdi  amines  surfactants  epoxy based polymer formulations  textile chemicals  dyes  maleic anhydride and titanium dioxide 
our administrative  research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in item properties above  which are located in countries 
we employed approximately  associates worldwide at december  we operate in five segments polyurethanes  advanced materials  textile effects  performance products and pigments 
our polyurethanes  advanced materials  textile effects and performance products segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments segment produces inorganic chemical products 
in a series of transactions beginning in  we have sold or shutdown substantially all of our polymers and base chemicals operations 
we report the results from our former polymers and base chemicals businesses as discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements 
growth in our polyurethanes  advanced materials and textile effects segments has been driven by the continued substitution of our products for other materials across a broad range of applications  as well as by the level of global economic activity 
historically  demand for many of these products has grown at rates in excess of gdp growth 
in polyurethanes  this growth  particularly in asia  has in recent years resulted in improved demand and higher industry capacity utilization rates for many of our key products  including mdi 
however  new capacity combined with slower global demand has reduced capacity utilization in in january  we idled our po mtbe production facility at port neches  texas for turnaround and inspection 
this planned shutdown is expected to last until the end of the first quarter of and we expect the reduced capacity to negatively impact results of our polyurethanes segment during the first quarter 
timely startup of this facility is subject to construction and weather delays 
in our performance products segment  demand for our performance specialties has generally continued to grow at rates in excess of gdp as overall demand is significantly influenced by new product and application development 
demand for most of our performance intermediates has grown in line with gdp growth 
over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is heavily influenced by construction end markets  maleic anhydride demand can be cyclical 
historically  demand for titanium dioxide pigments has grown at rates approximately equal to global gdp growth 
pigment prices have historically reflected industry wide operating rates but have typically lagged behind movements in these rates by up to twelve months due to the effects of product stocking and destocking by customers and producers  contract arrangements and seasonality 
the industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because sales of paints  the largest end use for titanium dioxide  generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere 
this results in greater sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the year 

table of contents for further information regarding sales price and demand trends  see results of operations segment analysis current year vs 
prior year decrease and results of operations segment analysis fourth quarter vs 
third quarter increase decrease below 
outlook sales volumes decreased for the year ended december  compared with  but increased in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
we are encouraged by recent trends in underlying demand 
we expect demand in asia to continue to be robust 
furthermore  we expect demand in the us to recover in conjunction with the construction and automotive markets 
we are uncertain as to demand recovery in certain of our markets in europe 
we expect that raw materials and energy costs could rise in the future but we expect to pass those costs increases on to our customers 
however  in certain product lines it could take up to to days to do so 
we will continue to make efforts to exercise operational discipline and maximize the manufacturing efficiency of our facilities 
we also have a number of innovative products in our current portfolio and in development that address energy concerns that we expect to provide long term benefits

table of contents we believe that ebitda enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance and our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international llc  as appropriate  cash flow from operations or other measures of performance as defined by gaap 
moreover  ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
our management uses ebitda to assess financial performance and debt service capabilities 
in assessing financial performance  our management reviews ebitda as a general indicator of economic performance compared to prior periods 
because ebitda excludes interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  ebitda provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by debt restructurings  fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates  or levels of depreciation and amortization 
accordingly  our management believes this type of measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period and making certain related management decisions 
ebitda is also used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry 
for example  interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure  debt levels and credit ratings 
therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies 
in addition  the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate 
as a result  effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies 
finally  companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets 
this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 
our management also believes that our investors use ebitda as a measure of our ability to service indebtedness as well as to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
nevertheless  our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international llc  as appropriate  which reflects overall financial performance  including the effects of interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda excludes interest expense 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
ebitda also excludes taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
finally  ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations 
our management compensates for the limitations of using ebitda by using it to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than gaap results alone 
our management also uses other metrics to evaluate capital structure  tax planning and capital investment decisions 
for example  our management uses credit ratings and net debt ratios to evaluate capital structure  effective tax rate by jurisdiction to evaluate tax planning  and payback period and internal rate of return to evaluate capital investments 
our management also uses trade working capital to evaluate its investment in accounts receivable and inventory  net of accounts payable 
we believe that net income loss attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international llc  as appropriate  is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda and that cash provided by 
table of contents operating activities is the liquidity measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda

see segment analysis below 
our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for the year ended december  decreased by million each  or and  respectively  as compared with lower gross profit in our advanced materials  textile effects  performance products and pigments segments was offset somewhat by higher gross profit in our polyurethanes segment 
see segment analysis below

notes payable from huntsman international to huntsman corporation as of december   under an existing promissory note the intercompany note  we have loaned million to our subsidiary  huntsman international 
the intercompany note is unsecured and million of the outstanding amount is classified as current as of december  on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   under the terms of the intercompany note  huntsman international promises to pay us interest on the unpaid principal 
table of contents amount at a rate per annum based on the previous monthly average borrowing rate obtained under our a r program  less basis points provided that the rate shall not exceed an amount that is basis points less than the monthly average borrowing rate obtained for the us libor based borrowings under our revolving facility 
subject to the conditions of the waiver  with our consent  the principal and accrued interest outstanding under the intercompany note may also be forgiven  capitalized or satisfied with any alternate form of consideration 
compliance with covenants our management believes that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt instruments  including huntsman international s senior credit facilities  huntsman international s a r programs and the indentures governing huntsman international s notes 
we have only one financial covenant under huntsman international s senior credit facilities the leverage covenant which applies to huntsman international s million revolving facility 
the leverage covenant is applicable only if borrowings  letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility cash collateralized letters of credit or guarantees are not deemed outstanding 
on april   huntsman international entered into the waiver with respect to the leverage covenant 
the leverage covenant  as amended pursuant to the waiver  requires that the secured leverage ratio does not exceed to 
huntsman international may consent to terminating the waiver in conjunction with a proposed amendment to the revolving facility we are currently seeking 
in that event  the secured leverage ratio would return to to 
if in the future huntsman international is not able to meet the secured leverage ratio  unless we obtain an amendment or waiver as to which we can provide no assurance  then  for so long as we did not meet the secured leverage ratio  we would not have access to the liquidity otherwise available under our revolving facility 
if we fail to meet the secured leverage ratio at a time when we had loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility  we would be in default under huntsman international s senior credit facilities  and  unless we obtain a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default as to which we can provide no assurance  we could be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and would not have further access to such facilities 
our a r programs consist of two facilities the million us a r program and the approximately million eu a r program 
the agreements governing the us a r program and the agreements governing the eu a r program also contain certain financial covenants 
any material failure to meet the applicable a r programs covenants in the future could lead to an event of default under the a r programs  which could require us to cease our use of such facilities 
under these circumstances  unless any default was remedied or waived  we would likely lose the ability to obtain financing with respect to our trade receivables 
a material default under the a r programs would also constitute an event of default under huntsman international s senior credit facilities  which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of the senior credit facilities 
short term and long term liquidity we depend upon our cash  credit facilities  a r programs and other debt instruments to provide liquidity for our operations and working capital needs 
as of december   we had  million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity  consisting of  million in cash and restricted cash  million in availability under our revolving facility  million in availability under our european overdraft facility and million in availability under our a r programs

excluding the impact of the texas bank litigation settlement  related taxes and the resulting redemptions of our notes in  our liquidity as of december  comprised of cash and unused borrowing capacity increased million compared to december  in spite of the impact of the worldwide recession on earnings 
this was largely due to effective working capital management  reduced capital expenditures and minimal scheduled debt maturities 
during  we expect to spend between million and million for capital expenditures 
we expect to fund capital expenditures through a combination of available cash and cash flows from operations 
our liquidity can be significantly impacted by various factors 
concerning changes in working capital components for the year ended december   our accounts receivable and inventory  net of accounts payable  decreased by approximately million  as reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
our inventories decreased by million largely as a result of improved inventory management efforts and reduced inventory costs 
in addition  during the year ended december   amounts outstanding under the a r program decreased by million from million as of december  to million as of december  
the reduction in amounts outstanding under the a r program was largely due to our decreased need to utilize the program as a result of our significant cash balances 
we expect volatility in our working capital components to continue 
on september   we announced the closure of our styrenics facility located at west footscray  australia 
we ceased operation of the west footscray styrene plant on january  and we expect to complete the subsequent closure of our polystyrene and expandable polystyrene plants during the first quarter of during  we recorded closure costs of approximately million million primarily in severance  million of contract termination costs and a million preliminary estimate of environmental remediation costs and expect to incur other closure related costs of approximately million in we can provide no assurance that the eventual environmental remediation costs will not be materially different from our current estimate 
the closure costs are expected to be funded as they are incurred over the next several years  with severance costs to be paid primarily in for a discussion of restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs  see note restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs to our consolidated financial statements 
on april   we experienced fire damage at our port arthur  texas facility

table of contents policy for losses caused by the fire 
the arbitration panel has made a preliminary ruling disallowing our claim for interest 
in addition  the arbitration panel has made certain preliminary rulings on some of the discrete issues that so far effectively reduce the overall amount we have claimed by approximately million 
a final ruling on these and the various other outstanding issues under the claim are not expected until after the oral arguments scheduled in march collections on this insured loss  if any  will represent additional income from discontinued operations for us upon final settlement  and will be used to repay secured debt in accordance with relevant provisions of our debt agreements

we are currently seeking to amend our revolving facility to  among other things  reduce the committed availability to million and extend the maturity to four years from the date of the amendment 
no assurance can be given that we will obtain these amendments 
due to our ample liquidity in  the effect of the current credit environment has been limited with regards to our need to access the credit markets 
in addition  we have actively managed our credit exposure to ensure minimal credit losses during the recent economic environment 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments our obligations under long term debt including the current portion  lease agreements and other contractual commitments as of december  are summarized below dollars in millions after total long term debt  including current portion interest operating leases purchase commitments total interest calculated using interest rates as of december  and contractual maturity dates 
we have various purchase commitments extending through for materials  supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course of business 
included in the purchase commitments table above are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for certain contracts allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility 
to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period  such notice period has been included in the above table 
the contractual purchase price for substantially all of these contracts is variable based upon market prices  subject to annual negotiations 
we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our pricing for each contract 
we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is purchased 
we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
summarized below are our critical accounting policies fair value pursuant to the texas bank litigation settlement agreement  on june   huntsman international entered into an amendment of its senior credit facilities that created term loan c with a million principal amount and also issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
in accordance with accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements  we recorded the term loan c and the senior notes in our accounting records at fair values of million and million  respectively  upon initial recognition in june we primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of these instruments 
fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows calculated using interest rates that were available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms  adjusted for differences in remaining maturity using relevant debt yield curves 

table of contents management used judgment with respect to assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the term loan c and the senior notes 
the effect of the following changes in certain key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions balance sheet impact effective market yield increase decrease estimated increase decrease to june fair values of term loan c and senior notes pursuant to the apollo settlement agreement  on december   we issued million of our convertible notes to apollo affiliates under the note purchase agreement 
in accordance with accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements  we recorded these convertible notes in our accounting records at a fair value of million upon initial recognition in december as previously noted  we repurchased these notes on january  we primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of the convertible notes 
fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  calculated using management s best estimates of key assumptions including relevant interest rates  expected share volatility  dividend yields  and the probabilities associated with certain features of the convertible notes 
we also used the market approach to assess comparables and corroborate the fair value determined using the income approach 
management used judgment with respect to assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the convertible notes 
the effect of the following changes in certain key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions balance sheet impact expected volatility increase decrease effective market yield increase decrease estimated increase decrease to december  fair value of convertible notes revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long term supply agreements 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists  risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
revenue arrangements that contain multiple deliverables  which relate primarily to the licensing of technology  are evaluated in accordance with asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to determine whether the arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using last in first out lifo  first in first out  and average cost methods for different components of inventory 
market is determined based on net realizable value for finished goods inventories and replacement cost for raw materials and work in process inventories 
in periods of declines in the selling prices of our finished products  inventory carrying values may exceed the net realizable value upon sale  resulting in a lower of cost or market charge 
we evaluate the need for a lower of cost or market adjustment to inventories based on the period end selling prices of our finished products 
long lived assets the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment are estimated based upon our historical experience  engineering estimates and industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets 
the estimated lives of our property range from to years and depreciation is recorded on the straight line method 
inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures will be performed 
without on going capital improvements and maintenance  the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter 
management uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets 
at december   if the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment had either been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives  then depreciation expense for the year ended december  would have been approximately million less or million greater  respectively 
we are required to evaluate our plant assets whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or when management s plans change regarding those assets  such as idling or closing a plant 
we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are largely independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values 
key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life  technology  competitive pressures  raw material pricing and regulations 
in connection with our asset evaluation policy  we reviewed all of our long lived assets for indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable and determined that such indicators did not exist as of december  goodwill we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually at the beginning of the third quarter and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
currently  substantially all of our goodwill balance relates to our advanced materials reporting unit 
fair value is estimated using the market approach  as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are dependent on several significant assumptions including  among others  market information  operating results  earnings projections and anticipated future cash flows 
we tested goodwill for impairment at the beginning of the third quarter of as part of the annual impairment testing procedures and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the results of our annual impairment testing indicated the excess of fair value of our advanced materials reporting unit over its carrying value was approximately million 
in the first half of  our market capitalization was below the net book value of our company 
we have evaluated the movement in our stock price as it relates to the fair values of our reporting 
table of contents units 
based on this evaluation  we determined that we did not have a triggering event that would require an interim goodwill impairment test 
as of december   our market capitalization was well in excess of the net book value of our company 
restructuring and plant closing costs we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations  workforce reductions and other cost savings programs 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
also in connection with the textile effects acquisition  we recorded liabilities for workforce reduction  non cancelable lease termination costs and demolition  decommissioning and other restructuring costs 
estimates for plant closing costs include the write off of the carrying value of the plant  any necessary environmental and or regulatory costs  contract termination and demolition costs 
estimates for workforce reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information  as necessary 
while management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the initial estimate  management s estimates on a project by project basis have not varied to a material degree 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
uncertainties regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions 
we do not provide for income taxes or benefits on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries as earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
we adopted new accounting guidance regarding uncertainty in income taxes on january   the cumulative effect of which was not significant 
this new accounting guidance clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more likely than not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law  in order to recognize an income tax benefit 
this requires us to make many assumptions and judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law 
additionally  if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more likely than not we are required to make judgments and assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a consequence  changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents employee benefit programs we sponsor several contributory and non contributory defined benefit plans  covering employees primarily in the us  the us  the netherlands  belgium and switzerland  but also covering employees in a number of other countries 
we fund the material plans through trust arrangements or local equivalents where the assets are held separately from us 
we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the us and canada 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries 
inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected return on assets  discount rates  compensation increases  mortality rates and health care costs trends 
these assumptions are disclosed in note employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements 
management  with the advice of its actuaries  uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses are based 
the effect of a change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact discount rate increase decrease expected return on assets increase decrease rate of compensation increase increase decrease estimated increase decrease on net periodic benefit cost estimated increase decrease on december  pension and postretirement liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss income environmental reserves environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation  available technology  site specific information and remediation alternatives 
we accrue an amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information 
the extent of environmental damage may not be fully known and the processes and costs of remediation may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved 
our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available  technology that can be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage 
adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation progresses 
for further information  see note environmental  health and safety matters to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  such as changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks 
from time to time  we enter into transactions  including transactions involving derivative instruments  to manage certain of these exposures 
we also hedge our net investment in 
table of contents certain european operations 
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged items are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  to the extent effective  and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain international operations are recorded in other comprehensive income  to the extent effective 
the effectiveness of a cash flow hedging relationship is established at the inception of the hedge  and after inception we perform effectiveness assessments at least every three months 
a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is determined to be effective if the change in value of the hedge divided by the change in value of the hedged item is within a range of to 
hedge ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedge occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction 
for a derivative that does not qualify or has not been designated as a hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
interest rate risks through our borrowing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio  including the duration of the portfolio and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates 
actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities  as well as entering into interest rate derivative instruments 
from time to time  we may purchase interest rate swaps and or interest rate collars to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate long term debt 
under interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
the collars entitle us to receive from the counterparties major banks the amounts  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings exceed a certain rate  and require us to pay to the counterparties major banks the amount  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings are less than a certain rate 
on december   we entered into a five year year interest rate contract to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our senior credit facilities 
the notional value of this contract is million and was designated as a cash flow hedge 
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
we will pay a fixed on the hedge and receive the one month libor rate 
as of december   the fair value of the hedge was million and is recorded in other noncurrent assets 
in addition  on january  we entered into five year interest rate contract to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our senior credit facilities 
the notional value of this contract is million and was designated as a cash flow hedge 
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
we will pay a fixed on the hedge and receive the one month libor rate 
interest rate contracts were recorded as a component of other noncurrent assets and liabilities as of december  the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
as of december   the fair value was not 
table of contents considered significant 
as of december  and  we had contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss income associated with cash flow hedging activities were not considered significant 
during  interest expense of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings 
the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative financial instruments 
we anticipate  however  that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
a one percentage point change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our outstanding interest rate hedge 
foreign exchange rate risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
our revenues and expenses are denominated in various currencies 
we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short term impact of movements in foreign currency rates 
where practicable  we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions  principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts generally with maturities of one year or less 
we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings 
as of december   we had approximately million notional amount in us dollar equivalents outstanding in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month 
a one percentage point change in foreign exchange rates would not have a significant impact on these foreign exchange contracts 
on january   we entered into a series of forward foreign currency contracts in our pigments segment to partially hedge the impact  for up to one year  of movements in foreign currency rates associated with the purchases of raw materials and sales of pigment in non functional currencies 
during the first quarter of  any remaining contracts matured and the realized gains losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations were not considered significant 
as of december   these contracts had a notional amount of approximately million and were designated as cash flow hedges 
as of december   the fair value of these contracts was not considered significant 
for the year ended december   the effective portion of the changes in the fair value was not significant with ineffectiveness of million recorded as a decrease in sales  million recorded as a reduction in cost of sales and a foreign currency loss of million 
on october   we unwound a cross currency interest rate swap pursuant to which we had swapped million of libor floating rate debt payments for million of euribor floating rate debt payments 
this swap was not designated as a hedge for financial reporting purposes 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a foreign currency gain loss on this swap of million and million  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
on october   we unwound a cross currency interest rate swap pursuant to which we had swapped million of libor floating rate debt payments for million of euribor floating rate debt payments 
this swap was designated as a hedge of a net investment for financial reporting purposes 
we received a cash benefit from the unwind of million in the fourth quarter of for the years ended december  and  the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of 
table of contents million and million  respectively  was recorded as income loss in other comprehensive loss income  with ineffectiveness of million and nil  respectively  recorded in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
on july   we unwound a cross currency interest rate swap pursuant to which we had swapped million of fixed rate debt for million of fixed rate debt 
the swap was not designated as a hedge for financial reporting purposes 
we recorded an unrealized foreign currency loss on this swap of million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  a significant portion of our debt is denominated in euros 
we also finance certain of our non us subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are  in many cases  denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currency 
we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means  including cross currency swaps  the designation of certain intercompany loans as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future permanent loans and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income 
from time to time  we review such designation of intercompany loans 
we review our non us dollar denominated debt to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges 
as of december   we have designated approximately million approximately million of euro denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment 
for the years ended december   and  the amount of loss gain recognized on the hedge of our net investment was million  million and million  respectively  and was recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
as of december   we had approximately million approximately  million in net euro assets 
commodity prices risk our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices  and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice 
consequently  we do not generally hedge our commodity exposures
