forward looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the risks and uncertainties identified by us under the heading risk factors in item a of part i 
furthermore  we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
we cannot predict what these new risk factors may be  nor can we assess the impact  if any  of such new risk factors on our business or results of operations or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by any of our forward looking statements

except as required by law  we disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k to reflect new information  future events or other developments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider the following critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make the most significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
net revenue we derive a significant portion of our net revenue from medicare  medicaid and managed care health plans 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce patient charges to the estimated cash receipts based on each program s principles of payment reimbursement ie  either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final settlements under these programs are subject to administrative review and audit and  accordingly  we periodically provide reserves for the adjustments that may ultimately result therefrom 
estimates for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are primarily based on the payment terms of contractual arrangements  such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or discounted fee for service rates 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to ensure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
if the actual contractual reimbursement percentage under government programs and managed care contracts differed by from our estimated percentage  we project that our net accounts receivable and consolidated net income as of and for the year ended december  would have changed by approximately million and million  respectively 
in the ordinary course of business  we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for their care 
accounts characterized as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net revenue 
we maintain a uniform policy whereby patient account balances are characterized as charity and indigent care only if the patient meets certain percentages of the federal poverty level guidelines 
local hospital personnel and our collection agencies pursue payments on accounts receivable from patients who do not meet such criteria 
we monitor the levels of charity and indigent care provided by our hospitals and other health care facilities and the procedures employed to identify and account for those patients 

table of contents provision for doubtful accounts our hospitals and other health care facilities provide services to patients with health care coverage  as well as to those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of their bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion of the bill is determined by the patient s individual health care or insurance plan 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service  or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our policies for indigent and charity care 
after payment  if any  is received from a third party  statements are sent to patients indicating the outstanding balances on their accounts 
if an account is still outstanding after a period of time  it is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection by contacting the patient via mail and phone 
the accounts that are sent to these agencies are often difficult to collect and require more focused  dedicated attention than might be available in one of our business offices 
we believe that the primary collection agencies have been very successful in collecting the accounts that we send to them 
a secondary collection agency is used when accounts are returned from the primary collection agency as uncollectible 
these accounts are written off as uncollectible shortly after they are returned from the primary collection agency 
in certain circumstances  we may sell a portfolio of outstanding accounts receivable to an unrelated third party 
an account is typically sent to the primary collection agency automatically via electronic transfer of data at the end of the statement cycle although  if deemed necessary or appropriate  the account can be sent to the primary collection agency at any time 
accounts that are identified as self pay accounts with balances less than are automatically written off on the th day of each month 
all accounts that have been placed with a primary collection agency that are less than are also written off 
we closely monitor our cash collection trends and the aging of our accounts receivable 
based on our observations  we periodically adjust our accounting policies and estimates 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  we last substantively modified our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy during the year ended december  such accounting policy modification for self pay patients was based on  among other things  our self pay patient cash collection rates and significant increases in uninsured and underinsured patient volume that have been experienced by us and the hospital industry as a whole 
we believe that this policy change regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts for self pay accounts receivable appropriately addresses the risk of collection pertaining to the related accounts receivable 
over the past several years  we have not experienced similar adverse trends with respect to our other payors such as medicare  medicaid and managed care health plans 
when considering the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  accounts receivable balances are routinely reviewed in conjunction with health care industry trends indicators  historical collection rates by payor and other business and economic conditions that might reasonably be expected to affect the collectibility of patient accounts 
we believe that our principal risk of collection continues to be uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid but patient responsibility amounts generally deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
if our actual collection rate changed by from the estimated percentage that we used  we project that our allowance for doubtful accounts and consolidated net income as of and for the year ended december  would have changed by approximately million and million  respectively 
although we believe that our existing allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policies for all payor classes are appropriate and responsive to both the current health care environment and the overall economic climate  we will continue to monitor cash collections  accounts receivable agings and related industry trends 
changes in payor mix  general economic conditions or federal and state government health care coverage could each have a material adverse effect on our accounts receivable collections  cash flows and results of operations and could result in accounting policy modifications in the future 
of the accounts receivable identified as due from third party payors at the time of billing  a small percentage may convert to self pay upon denials from third party payors 
those accounts are closely monitored on a routine basis for potential denial and are reclassified as appropriate 
third party payor and self pay balances  as a percent of total gross billed accounts receivable  are summarized in the tables on the next page 

table of contents december  days days days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals december  days days days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals accounts receivable are reserved at increasing percentages as they age 
all accounts are reserved when they age days from the date of discharge 
in addition to days sales outstanding  which is discussed below under liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures  we utilize other factors to analyze the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in that regard  we compare subsequent cash collections to net accounts receivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also review the provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percent of gross accounts receivable 
these and other factors are reviewed monthly and are closely monitored for emerging trends in our accounts receivable portfolio 
impairments of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be fully recoverable eg  advances in technology  deteriorating operating results  excess capacity  obsolescence  etc 
the determination of possible impairment of assets to be held and used is predicated on our estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of  including discontinued operations  are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
estimates of fair value are generally based on recent sales of similar assets  market analyses  pending disposition transactions and market responses based upon discussions with  and offers received from  potential buyers 
there were no long lived asset impairment charges that were material to our continuing operations during the years ended december   and as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we recognized long lived asset and goodwill impairment charges of approximately million and million in discontinued operations during the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no such charges during the year ended december  goodwill 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever circumstances indicate that a possible impairment might exist 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on  among other things  market conditions and operational performance 
when performing the impairment test  we initially compare the estimated fair values of each reporting unit s net assets  including allocated home office net assets  to the corresponding carrying amounts on our consolidated balance sheet ie  step of the goodwill impairment test 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are determined using a market approach methodology based on net revenue multiples 
during both and  we also considered a valuation methodology using discounted cash flows and a market approach valuation methodology based on comparable transactions 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit s net assets is less than the balance sheet carrying amount  we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  compare such fair value to the corresponding carrying amount and  if necessary  record a goodwill impairment charge 
there were no goodwill impairment charges in continuing operations during the years ended december   and moreover  none of our reporting units are currently at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test 

table of contents we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but are ultimately unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
additionally  we make certain judgments and assumptions when allocating home office assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of our reporting units 
changes in the estimates used to conduct goodwill impairment tests  including revenue and profitability projections and market values  could indicate that our goodwill is impaired in future periods and result in a write off of some or all of our goodwill at that time 
reporting units are one level below the operating segment level see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 
however  after consideration of the relevant gaap aggregation rules  we determined that our goodwill impairment testing should be performed at a divisional operating level 
goodwill is discretely allocated to our reporting units ie  each hospital s goodwill is included as a component of the aggregate reporting unit goodwill being evaluated during the impairment analysis 
income taxes we make estimates to record the provision for income taxes  including conclusions regarding deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  as well as valuation allowances that might be required to offset deferred tax assets 
we estimate valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
when establishing valuation allowances  we consider all relevant information  including ongoing tax planning strategies 
we believe that  other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  future taxable income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets and  therefore  we have not recorded any material valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of our tax filings 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through the period ended december  and those examinations have historically resulted in no material audit adjustments 
our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  and are currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we make estimates to record tax reserves that we believe adequately provide for audit adjustments  if any 
professional liability risks commencing october   we began using our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  which is domiciled in the cayman islands  to self insure a significant portion of our professional liability risks 
since its inception  our captive insurance subsidiary has provided claims made coverage to all of our hospitals and a small number of our employed physicians 
to mitigate its exposure to large claims  our captive insurance subsidiary purchases claims made reinsurance policies for professional liability risks above certain self retention levels  which levels generally range by policy year from million to million 
prior to march   substantially all of our employed physicians were covered under claims made policies with unrelated third party insurance companies 
when a physician terminated employment with us  tail insurance was customarily purchased for the portion of employed service that was previously covered under a claims made policy 
effective march   we began providing occurrence basis insurance policies to most of our employed physicians through a wholly owned risk retention group subsidiary that is domiciled in south carolina 
the limits of liability provided by our risk retention group for each employed physician located outside of florida is generally million per claim and million in the aggregate  and the corresponding limits for physicians located in florida are  and  respectively 
employed physicians not covered by the risk retention group generally have claims made policies with unrelated third party insurance companies 
our self insured professional liability reserves reflect discounted estimates of all known indemnity losses  incurred but not reported indemnity losses and loss expenses 
such discounted reserves were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
historically  the average lag time between settlement of a claim and final payment to the claimant is generally less than one month 
our expense for professional liability risks includes i an estimate of losses for the current year  including claims incurred but not reported  ii changes in estimates for losses from prior years based on actual claim development experience  and iii interest related to the discounted portion of the reserves 
such expense was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
our reserves for self insured professional liability claims and related expenses are determined using actuarially based techniques and methodologies 
the data used to develop such reserves is based  in part  on asserted and unasserted claim information that has been accumulated by our incident reporting system 
we discounted these long term liabilities to their estimated present values using a discount rate of at both 
table of contents december  and we select a discount rate that represents the risk free interest rate correlating to the period when the claims are projected to be paid ie  a weighted average payment duration of approximately three years 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our professional liability reserve requirements by approximately million 
the discounted reserves are periodically reviewed and adjustments thereto are recorded as more information about claim trends becomes known to us 
although the ultimate settlement of these liabilities may vary from our estimates  we believe that the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and reasonable 
however  if actual losses and loss expenses exceed our projections of claim activity  our reserves could be impacted 
for purposes of estimating case reserves  we use individual claim information  including the nature of the claim  the expected claim amount  the year in which the claim occurred and the laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred 
once case reserves for known claims are determined  the data is stratified by loss layers and retention levels  accident years  reported years  geography and other key attributes 
several actuarial methods are applied to the data by us and our external actuaries to produce estimates of the ultimate indemnity losses and loss expenses for both known and incurred but not reported claims 
each of these actuarial methods uses our company specific data and other information  including historical paid indemnity losses and loss expenses  historical and current case reserves  actual and projected census data  employed physician information  our professional liability retention levels by policy year  geographic information  trending of loss development factors  trends in the frequency and severity of claims  coverage limits of unrelated third party insurance policies  and other relevant inputs 
we also consider pertinent industry data and changes in laws and regulations eg  tort reform  settlement caps  etc 
in the jurisdictions where our hospitals and other health care facilities operate 
we believe that using the aforementioned company specific data and other information enables us and our external actuaries to reasonably estimate our ultimate professional liability indemnity losses and loss expenses  as well as the projected timing of the corresponding payments 
therefore  we further believe that discounting of our self insured professional liability reserves is appropriate 
given the number of factors considered in establishing such reserves  we do not believe that it is practical or meaningful to isolate an individual assumption or parameter from the detail computational process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 
other self insured programs we provide income continuance to and reimburse certain health care costs of our disabled employees collectively  workers compensation and we provide health and welfare benefits to our employees  their spouses and certain beneficiaries 
such employee benefit programs are primarily self insured 
we record estimated liabilities for both reported and incurred but not reported workers compensation and health and welfare claims based on historical loss experience and other information provided by our third party administrators 
the long term liabilities for workers compensation are determined using actuarially based techniques and methodologies and are discounted to their estimated present values 
we select a discount rate that represents the risk free interest rate correlating to the period when such benefits are projected to be paid 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our workers compensation liabilities by approximately million 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that the liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements for these self insured programs are adequate and reasonable 
if the actual costs of these programs exceed our estimates  the liabilities could be materially adversely affected 
legal and other loss contingencies we regularly review the status of our legal matters and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a reserve 
significant judgment is required when determining probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
predicting the final outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating financial exposure requires consideration of substantial uncertainties and  therefore  actual costs may vary materially from our estimates 
when making determinations of likely outcomes of legal matters and the related financial exposure  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the nature of the claim including unasserted claims  the availability of insurance  our experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction where the matter is disputed  input from legal counsel  the likelihood of resolution through alternative dispute resolution or other means and the current status of the matter 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and we may revise and adjust our estimates at that time 
adjustments to reserves reflect the status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel and other relevant information 
changes in our estimates of the financial exposure for legal matters and other loss contingencies could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our material legal matters and other loss contingencies 

table of contents recent accounting developments see note r to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of recent accounting developments that may impact us 
results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in item as of december   we operated hospitals with a total of  licensed beds in non urban communities in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  washington and west virginia 
unless specifically indicated otherwise  the following discussion excludes our discontinued operations  which are identified at note to the consolidated financial statements in item such discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations during the years presented herein  other than the following items i and long lived asset and goodwill impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively  ii and gains of million and million  respectively  from sales of equity interests in a limited liability company that owned and operated two of our general acute care hospitals  iii a charge of million for the estimated cost of partially subsidizing certain third party physician practice losses  and iv a gain of million from the sale of a business and related assets 
during the year ended december   which we refer to as the calendar year  we experienced net revenue growth over the year ended december   which we refer to as the calendar year  of approximately 
such growth primarily resulted from i increased admissions and emergency room visits  ii favorable case mix trends  and iii improvements in reimbursement rates 
during the calendar year  income from continuing operations declined by approximately million when compared to the calendar year 
this decline was largely due to a gain of million from the sale of a equity interest in a limited liability company that owned leased and operated our seven general acute care hospitals in north carolina and south carolina 
excluding such gain  income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders of health management associates  inc increased million and  respectively  during the calendar year 
the primary factors contributing to this year over year increase in profitability were i lower interest costs  ii salaries and benefits increasing only during calendar year  notwithstanding a increase in net revenue  and iii a million other than temporary impairment charge for available for sale securities during the calendar year compared to million of realized gains on such securities during the calendar year 
partially offsetting these items during the calendar year were an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and a reduction of million in gains on sales dispositions of various health care operations and other assets 
in light of the downturn in the economy  declining consumer confidence and uncertainties about future economic conditions  we implemented several company wide cost containment measures 
our initiatives  most of which were implemented late in  were designed to position our company to remain profitable and strategically flexible while continually providing the highest level of patient care 
the cost containment measures that have been implemented to date include  among other things  personnel reductions  postponements of merit pay increases  new hire limitations and modifications to certain employee benefit plans 
there can be no assurances that our actions will adequately address the recent economic downturn  including levels of unemployment that are substantially higher than historical trends  and or other economic headwinds that we may face 
at our hospitals that were in operation for all of the calendar year and the calendar year  which we refer to herein as same hospitals  emergency room visits and hospital admissions increased during the calendar year by approximately and  respectively  however  our corresponding surgical volume declined 
we believe that the outbreak of hn influenza also known as swine flu contributed  in part  to the growth in our emergency room visits and hospital admissions during the calendar year  including an increase in admissions with upper respiratory diagnoses 
although hn influenza cases have been reported throughout the united states  we cannot predict what its future impact will be on our business and results of operations 

table of contents our strategic operating plans include  among other things  utilizing experienced local and regional management teams  modifying physician employment agreements  renegotiating payor contracts and continuing patient  physician and employee satisfaction surveys 
our prime objective is to enhance and improve operations in the areas of patient volume  operating margins  uninsured underinsured patient levels and the provision for doubtful accounts 
we also seek opportunities for market development in the communities that we serve  including establishing ambulatory surgical centers and orthopedic  cardiology and neurology neurosurgery centers of excellence 
furthermore  we continue to invest significant resources in physician recruitment and retention  emergency room operations and capital projects 
as a result  recent company wide investments to upgrade our emergency room clinical systems contributed  in large part  to the growth in emergency room visits and hospital admissions during the calendar year 
we believe that our strategic initiatives  coupled with appropriate executive management oversight  centralized support and innovative marketing campaigns  will enhance patient  physician and employee satisfaction  improve clinical outcomes and ultimately yield increased surgical volume  emergency room visits and admissions 
we also believe that continually improving our existing operations provides us with a solid foundation to leverage as we consider potential acquisitions and joint ventures in and beyond 
we have also taken the steps that we believe are necessary to achieve industry leadership in clinical quality 
our vision is to be the highest rated health care provider of any hospital system in the country  as measured by medicare 
with our knowledgeable and experienced clinical affairs leadership to support this critical quality initiative  we measure the appropriate performance objectives  increase accountability for achieving those objectives and recognize the leaders whose quality indicators and clinical outcomes demonstrate improvement 
our efforts are now paying off 
as most recently reported by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  all four of our core measure care areas have dramatically improved since the commencement of our clinical quality initiatives 
outpatient services continue to play an important role in the delivery of health care in our markets  with approximately half of our net revenue during both the calendar year and the calendar year generated on an outpatient basis 
recognizing the importance of these services  we have improved many of our health care facilities to accommodate the outpatient needs of the communities that they serve 
we have also invested substantial capital in many of our hospitals and physician practices during the past several years  resulting in improvements and enhancements to our diagnostic imaging and ambulatory surgical services 
economic conditions and changes in commercial health insurance benefit plans over the past several years have contributed to an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking health care in the united states 
as a result  self pay admissions as a percent of total admissions at our same hospitals increased from approximately during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
while we continue to take various measures to address the impact of uninsured and underinsured patients on our business  there can be no assurances that our self pay admissions will not continue to grow in future periods  especially in light of the recent downturn in the economy and correspondingly higher levels of unemployment 
we regularly evaluate our self pay policies and programs and consider changes or modifications as circumstances warrant

this change represented an increase of million  or 
such growth primarily resulted from i increased admissions and emergency room visits  ii favorable case mix trends  iii improvements in reimbursement rates  and iv million from our newly acquired hospital system in fort smith  arkansas 
these items were partially offset by unfavorable movement in our payor mix during the calendar year 
net revenue per admission at our same hospitals increased approximately during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
the factors contributing to such change included increased patient acuity and the favorable effects of renegotiated agreements with certain commercial health insurance providers 

table of contents our provision for doubtful accounts during the calendar year increased basis points to of net revenue as compared to of net revenue during the calendar year 
this change is primarily due to an increase in i uninsured patients in the mix of patients that we serve and ii co payments and deductibles due from underinsured patients  which subject us to a higher risk of collection 
both of these factors can be attributed  in part  to the recent downturn in the economy and correspondingly higher levels of unemployment 
our consistently applied accounting policy is that accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net revenue and  accordingly  such amounts have no impact on our provision for doubtful accounts 
however  as a measure of our fiscal performance  we routinely aggregate amounts pertaining to our i provision for doubtful accounts  ii uninsured self pay patient discounts and iii foregone unrecognized revenue for charity and indigent care and then we divide the resulting total by the sum of our i net revenue  ii uninsured self pay patient discounts and iii foregone unrecognized revenue for charity and indigent care 
we believe that this fiscal measure  which we refer to as our uncompensated patient care percentage  is important because it provides us with key information regarding the aggregate level of patient care for which we do not receive remuneration 
during the calendar year and the calendar year  our uncompensated patient care percentage was determined to be and  respectively 
the basis point increase during the calendar year reflects  among other things  a larger provision for doubtful accounts for our self pay patients 
salaries and benefits as a percent of net revenue decreased to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
this decline was primarily due to our company wide cost containment measures  most of which were implemented late in  such as headcount reductions  new hire limitations  lower personnel turnover  postponements of merit pay increases and an indefinite suspension of substantially all matching contributions to our k plan 
supplies as a percent of net revenue increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
this increase was primarily due to more cardiology and neuro surgery procedures having been performed during the calendar year  which resulted in our utilization of a larger quantity of costly cardiac and spinal implant devices and related supplies 
other operating expenses as a percent of net revenue was during both the calendar year and the calendar year 
increased costs for repairs and maintenance  professional fees  collection agency fees and recruiting fees during the calendar year were offset by reductions in advertising marketing costs  utilities and travel costs 
during the calendar year  we recorded gains on sales of assets of approximately i million from the sale of a equity interest in a limited liability company that owned leased and operated five of our general acute care hospitals in north carolina and south carolina and ii million from sales dispositions of three home health agencies  two nursing homes  a health care billing operation and other assets 
the sale of a home health agency during the calendar year yielded a gain of million  which was partially offset by nominal losses on other dispositions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding these transactions and other related matters 
interest and other income increased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year 
as more fully discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge for available for sale securities of million during the calendar year 
during the calendar year  we realized gains of million from sales of available for sale securities 
excluding the effects from our available for sale securities  interest and other income declined million during the calendar year  which was primarily due to i lower weighted average interest bearing cash balances and ii lower rates of return in the marketplace for our interest bearing cash 
as described at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we received million on march  from an affiliate of novant health  inc  which significantly increased our interest bearing cash balances during part of the calendar year 
interest expense decreased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year 
such decrease was primarily due to i a lower average outstanding principal balance on our billion seven year term loan the term loan during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year  ii a significant reduction of interest expense on our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes  substantially all of which were repurchased during  and iii reduced interest expense on our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
see liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our long term debt arrangements 

table of contents during the calendar year and the calendar year  we repurchased certain of the notes  which yielded net gains on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million and million  respectively 
during the calendar year  we also repurchased certain of the notes  which resulted in losses on the early extinguishment of debt aggregating million 
see liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures below and note c to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our convertible debt securities 
our effective income tax rates were approximately and during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  which is not tax effected in our consolidated financial statements  diluted our effective income tax rates by approximately and basis points during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
among other things  our provisions for income taxes during both the calendar year and the calendar year were adversely impacted by adjustments pertaining to stock based compensation and the related additional paid in capital pool of excess income tax benefits

this change represented an increase of million  or 
same hospitals provided million  or  of the growth in net revenue as a result of increases in emergency room visits and reimbursement rates and favorable case mix trends 
the remaining million increase was primarily attributable to physicians regional medical center collier boulevard  our de novo general acute care hospital that opened on february  net revenue per admission at our same hospitals increased approximately during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
the factors contributing to such change included increased patient acuity and the favorable effects of renegotiated agreements with certain commercial health insurance providers 
our provision for doubtful accounts during the calendar year declined basis points to of net revenue as compared to of net revenue during the calendar year 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  we modified our provision for doubtful accounts policy for self pay accounts receivable during the calendar year  resulting in the recognition of incremental expense of approximately million 
excluding the impact of such change in estimate  we experienced an increase of approximately basis points in the calendar year provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue 
such increase was primarily due to a reduction in the calendar year provision for doubtful accounts of million from the recovery of certain accounts receivable that were previously written off such recovery did not recur during the calendar year in a similar amount 
during the calendar year and the calendar year  our uncompensated patient care percentage  which is described above under the heading calendar year compared to the calendar year  was determined to be and  respectively 
as a result of the allowance for doubtful accounts policy modification discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  the uncompensated patient care percentage for the calendar year is more readily comparable to the six months ended december   which was 
the drop in our uncompensated patient care percentage during the calendar year reflects  among other things  then declining uninsured patient volume ie approximately and of total admissions at our same hospitals during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively  partially offset by the impact of the abovementioned calendar year accounts receivable recovery that did not recur during the calendar year in a similar amount

days sales outstanding days sales outstanding  or dso  is calculated by dividing quarterly net revenue by the number of days in the quarter 
the result is divided into the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter to obtain our dso 
we believe that this statistic is an important measure of collections on our accounts receivable  as well as our liquidity 
our dso was days at december   which compares to days at september  and days at december  as of december   we were in the process of transferring medicare and medicaid provider numbers for the hospital system that we recently acquired in fort smith  arkansas 
pending the completion of such transfers  we were unable to bill those programs for the services we provided  which correspondingly increased our dso by approximately two days 
income taxes other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  we believe that it is more likely than not that reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and carrybacks will allow us to realize the deferred tax assets that are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents effect of legislative and regulatory action on liquidity the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs are subject to change as a result of legislative and regulatory actions 
within the statutory framework of those programs  numerous areas are subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion that could affect payments made to us 
in the future  federal and or state governments might i reduce the funds available under those programs to close budget gaps or reduce deficit spending or ii require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care services in the united states  including the national health care reform legislation pending before congress  and or the continued prevalence of managed care health plans could have an adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
capital resources credit facilities senior secured credit facilities 
on march   we completed a recapitalization of our balance sheet the recapitalization wherein we entered into agreements for billion in new variable rate senior secured credit facilities the credit facilities 
the credit facilities were initially used to fund a special cash dividend and repay all amounts outstanding under a predecessor revolving credit agreement 
the credit facilities consist of a seven year billion term loan the term loan and a million six year revolving credit facility the revolving credit agreement 
the recapitalization and the credit facilities are discussed in further detail at note a to the consolidated financial statements in item the term loan requires i quarterly principal payments to amortize approximately of the loan s face value during each year of the loan s term and ii a balloon payment for the remaining outstanding loan balance at the termination of the agreement 
we are also required to repay principal under the term loan in an amount that can be as much as of our annual excess cash flow  as such term is defined in the loan agreement 
based on the annual excess cash flow generated during the calendar year  we were required to repay principal of approximately million under the term loan  which we satisfied with payments of million and million during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
we also prepaid million of principal under the term loan during the calendar year 
we determined that there was no annual excess cash flow generated during the calendar year and  accordingly  our mandatory principal payments under the credit facilities for the year ending december  are million 
throughout the revolving credit agreement s six year term  we are obligated to pay commitment fees based on the amounts available for borrowing 
additionally  the revolving credit agreement has a million standby letter of credit limit 
amounts outstanding under the credit facilities may be repaid at our option at any time  in whole or in part  without penalty 
we can elect whether interest on the credit facilities  which is generally payable quarterly in arrears  is calculated using libor or prime as its base rate 
the effective interest rate includes a spread above our selected base rate and is subject to modification in certain circumstances 
additionally  we may elect differing base interest rates for the term loan and the revolving credit agreement 
during  as required by the agreements underlying the credit facilities  we entered into a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap contract that provides for us to pay a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount of such contract for the seven year term of the term loan 
notwithstanding this contractual arrangement  we remain ultimately responsible for all amounts due and payable under the term loan 
therefore  we are exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by one or more of the counterparties to the interest rate swap contract 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item regarding the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap contract 
at december   approximately million of the term loan s outstanding balance was not covered by the interest rate swap contract and  accordingly  such amount was subject to the credit facilities variable interest rate provisions ie  an effective interest rate of approximately on both december  and february  
although there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement on february   standby letters of credit in favor of third parties of approximately million reduced the amount available for borrowing thereunder to million on such date 
our effective interest rate on the variable rate revolving credit agreement was approximately on both december  and february  we intend to fund the term loan s quarterly interest payments  required annual principal payments and mandatory annual excess cash flow payments with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and or borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 

table of contents demand promissory note 
we maintain a million secured demand promissory note in favor of a bank for use as a working capital line of credit in conjunction with our cash management program 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the demand promissory note  we may borrow and repay  on a revolving basis  up to the principal face amount of the note 
all principal and accrued interest will be immediately due and payable upon the bank s written demand 
the demand promissory note s effective interest rate on february  was approximately  however  there were no amounts outstanding thereunder on such date 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding the demand promissory note and its predecessor arrangement 
convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes on may   we completed a private placement of million of the notes 
after transaction related costs  the sale of the notes resulted in our receipt of net proceeds of approximately million  which we used to repurchase certain of our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes in the open market 
the notes mature on may  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
since december   we have used cash on hand to repurchase million of principal face amount notes in the open market at approximately of their principal face value  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes and the notes are discussed in further detail at note c to the consolidated financial statements in item debt covenants the credit facilities and the indentures governing the notes  the notes and our senior notes due contain covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in those debt agreements 
specifically  the table below summarizes what we believe are the key financial covenants under the credit facilities and our corresponding actual performance as of and for the period ended december  requirement actual minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio to to maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio to to although there can be no assurances  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
should we fail to comply with one or more of our debt covenants in the future and are unable to remedy the matter  an event of default may result 
in that circumstance  we would seek a waiver from our lenders or renegotiate the related debt agreement  however  such renegotiations could  among other things  subject us to higher interest and financing costs on our debt obligations and our credit ratings could be adversely affected 
dividends as part of the recapitalization  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend that totaled approximately billion 
in light of the special cash dividend  which was paid in march  we indefinitely suspended all future dividend payments 
additionally  the credit facilities restrict our ability to pay cash dividends 
standby letters of credit as of february   we maintained approximately million of standby letters of credit in favor of third parties with various expiration dates through october  should any or all of these letters of credit be drawn upon  we intend to satisfy such obligations with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures and other we believe that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment will range from to of our net revenue for the year ending december   which is within the capital expenditure limitations of the credit facilities 
as of december   a number of hospital renovation and expansion projects were underway 
we estimate that the cost to build and equip a replacement hospital for walton regional medical center in monroe  georgia will range from million to million 
although we recently negotiated a deferral of all construction activities for this replacement hospital until december   we are currently obligated to complete construction no later than december  we do not believe that any of our hospital renovation and expansion projects are individually significant or that they represent  in the aggregate  a material commitment of our resources 

table of contents part of our strategic business plan calls for us to acquire hospitals that are aligned with our business model  available at a reasonable price and otherwise meet our strict acquisition criteria 
we generally fund acquisitions  replacement hospital construction and other recurring capital expenditures with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  amounts available under revolving credit agreements and proceeds from long term debt issuances  or a combination thereof 
divestitures of idle property as more fully discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we intend to sell i gulf coast medical center  formerly a general acute care hospital in biloxi  mississippi that we closed on january   and ii the woman s center at dallas regional medical center  formerly a specialty women s hospital in mesquite  texas that we closed on june  however  the timing of such divestitures has not yet been determined 
we intend to use the proceeds from the sales of these hospitals for general business purposes 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements except as set forth in the table below  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we had recorded approximately i million as a liability for our interest rate swap contract  ii million for redeemable equity securities  and iii million as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
we excluded these amounts from the table below due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be paid  if any  as well as the timing of such payments 
as of december   contractual obligations for each of the next five years ending december and thereafter including principal and interest and other commitments are summarized in the table below 
interest rates at december  were used in the table to estimate interest payments on variable rate debt 
payments due by year ending december  contractual obligations thereafter in thousands long term debt a capital leases operating leases b physician commitments c total contractual obligations commitment expiration by year ending december  other commitments not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet thereafter in thousands letters of credit d physician commitments c other e total commitments a for purposes of the above table  we assumed that we would repurchase the remaining notes and the notes on august  and may   respectively  because the noteholders can unilaterally exercise their contractual rights to require us to repurchase some or all of their notes on such dates 
b amounts relate to obligations under operating leases for real property  real property master leases and equipment 
the real property master leases are leases for buildings near our hospitals for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income to the owners of the property 
we sublease space in these buildings to unrelated third parties 
future operating lease obligations are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
c see note o to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding physician and physician group guarantees and commitments 
d amount relates to outstanding letters of credit that principally serve as security for our workers compensation self insurance program and utility companies 
e other includes construction costs to build a replacement hospital for walton regional medical center in monroe  georgia  purchase commitments for supplies and other miscellaneous commitments 

table of contents impact of seasonality and inflation seasonality we typically experience higher patient volume and net revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which in turn increases the number of patients we treat during those months 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive and subject to wage and related employee benefit expense increases  especially during periods of inflation and when there exists a shortage of skilled labor 
a skilled nursing staff shortage throughout the health care industry has caused nursing salaries to increase 
we have addressed our nursing staff needs by increasing wages  improving hospital working conditions and fostering relationships with local nursing schools 
we do not believe that the inflationary trend in nursing salaries or the nursing shortage will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
suppliers  utility companies and other vendors pass their cost increases to us in the form of higher prices 
we believe that we have been able to partially offset increases in our operating costs by increasing prices  achieving quantity discounts for purchases through our group purchasing agreement and efficiently utilizing our resources 
although we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs  we cannot predict our ability to recover or offset future cost increases from our many vendors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pursuant to the requirements of the agreements underlying the credit facilities  we entered into a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap contract  which provides for us to pay a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract for the seven year term of the term loan 
because approximately million of the term loan was not covered by our interest rate swap contract on december   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
the interest rates on substantially all of our other long term debt  including capital lease obligations  at december  were fixed and  accordingly  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on us but increases in interest rates would correspondingly increase interest expense associated with any of our future borrowings 
as of december   the estimated fair value and carrying amount of our fixed rate debt  including capital lease obligations  were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
additionally  both the estimated fair value and carrying amount of our variable rate debt was million at such date
