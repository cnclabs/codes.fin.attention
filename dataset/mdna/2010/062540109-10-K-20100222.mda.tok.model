critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
the most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions or judgments to be made based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates 
those policies have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than reported if there is a change to any of the estimates  assumptions  or judgments made by us 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions  and judgments used  we identified the determination of the reserve for credit losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of leased asset residual values  the valuation of pension and postretirement benefit obligations  and the determination of income tax expense and liability to be the accounting estimates that are the most subjective or judgmental 
reserve for credit losses a consequence of lending activities is that we may incur losses 
the amount of such losses will vary  depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions  including rising interest rates  and the financial performance of borrowers 
the reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve 
the reserve for credit losses provides for credit losses inherent in lending or commitments to lend and is based on loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation  reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit judgment to address observed changes in trends  
table of contents conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors 
the allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios  and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
on a quarterly basis  an evaluation of specific individual commercial borrowers is performed to identify impaired loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the reserve for credit losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights when mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
an estimated fair value is used because there is no quoted or established market for valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service  and interest rates that reflect the risks involved 
our estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are sensitive to changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions 
had we assumed lower interest rates and higher loan repayment rates  the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights could have been lower than recorded in our consolidated statements of condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for key assumptions used by management as well as a sensitivity analysis of changes in certain key assumptions 
valuation of leased asset residual values lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
our determination of residual value is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals  and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until lease termination  the cyclical nature of equipment values  and the limited marketplace for re sale of certain leased assets  are important variables considered in making this determination 
we update our valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more often when events or circumstances warrant 
when we determine that the fair value is lower than the expected residual value at lease expiration  the difference is recognized as an asset impairment in the period in which the analysis is completed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the residual value of leased assets 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on a number of key assumptions  including the discount rate  estimated future return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
our determination of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash out flows for benefit payments and cash in flows for maturities and return on plan assets 
changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
the discount rate used to value the future benefit obligation as of each year end is the rate used to determine the periodic benefit cost in the following year

income taxes we determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulation and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation 
currently  we file tax returns in federal  state and local domestic jurisdictions  and four foreign jurisdictions 
in estimating income taxes payable or receivable  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position 
accordingly  previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted  through the provision for income taxes 
changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax law  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position 
these changes  when they occur  affect accrued income taxes and can be significant to our operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes

net interest income net interest income is affected by both changes in interest rates rate and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities volume 
net interest margin is calculated as the yield on average earning assets minus the interest rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities 
due to the continued uncertainty regarding economic and industry conditions in  we focused on building and maintaining liquidity

our portfolio is also used to offset interest rate risk positions and to provide collateral for various banking activities 
the carrying amount of our investment securities was billion as of december  this represents a billion increase from december   exclusive of the trading securities we held as of that date 
the increase in the carrying amount of our investment securities during was primarily due to investments made in debt securities issued by the us treasury and mortgage backed securities issued by government agencies 
these investments in high grade securities with relatively short duration  allows us to maintain flexibility to redeploy funds as such opportunities arise 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our remaining investments in private label mortgage backed securities 
our investment securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million or of total amortized cost as of december  our investment securities portfolio also had gross unrealized losses of million or less than of total amortized cost as of december  the unrealized losses were primarily related to mortgage backed securities issued by government agencies attributable to changes in interest rates  relative to when the investment securities were purchased

commercial mortgages are secured by real estate 
the source of repayment for investor property is cash flow from the property and for owner occupied property is the operating cash flow from the business 
construction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property 
lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases 
although our primary market is hawaii  the commercial portfolio contains loans to some borrowers based on the us mainland  including some shared national credits 
commercial loans and leases decreased by million or from billion as of december  this was primarily due to a million decrease in our commercial and industrial lending portfolio due to continued loan payoffs by corporate national customers and the sale of our position in six shared national credits totaling million  given the potential downside risk of each credit 
our construction loan portfolio decreased by million  consistent with the slow economy in hawaii 
our lease financing portfolio decreased by million  primarily a result of continued reduction in our leveraged lease portfolio 
partially offsetting the decrease in these commercial lending categories was a million increase in our commercial mortgage portfolio 
this increase was primarily due to one new commercial credit added during the second quarter of as well as our purchase of million in seasoned loans  secured by real estate in hawaii  in december the consumer loan and lease portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans  home equity loans  personal credit lines  direct installment loans  and indirect auto loans and leases 
these products are offered generally in the markets we serve through our branch network

as of december   the carrying value of our fhlb stock was million and consisted of  shares valued at a par value of per share 
our investment in the fhlb is a condition of membership and  as such  is required to obtain credit and other services from the fhlb 
the fhlb adopted a capital plan which among other things provided for the mandatory redemption of members stock within five years of such request 
in  the bank requested the redemption of  shares  which under the fhlb s capital plan would be redeemable in in  the fhlb s primary regulator  the federal housing finance agency  has chosen to treat the fhlb as if it was undercapitalized because of several factors  including the possibility that declines in the value of its private label mortgage backed securities could cause it to fall below its risk based capital requirements 
due to this determination  the fhlb currently remains unable to repurchase or redeem capital stock or to pay dividends 
as of september   the fhlb had received requests to redeem million shares of capital stock  including the bank s request to redeem  shares of stock 
the fhlb has accounted for these requests by recording a liability under the caption mandatorily redeemable capital stock on its balance sheet 
in the form q for third quarter of  the fhlb stated that the fair value of capital stock subject to mandatory redemption generally approximates par value as indicated by contemporaneous member purchases and transfers at par value 
the bank continues to use and has access to the services of the fhlb 
management considers several factors in evaluating impairment including the commitment of the issuer to perform its obligations and to provide services to the bank

due to our successful deposit gathering efforts and our increased capital levels  we reduced the level of borrowings as a source of funds 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities sold under agreements to repurchase were billion as of december   a million or increase from december  this increase was primarily due to new placements to accommodate local government entities 
a portion of the increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase resulted from the withdrawal of public interest bearing demand deposits in securities sold under agreements to repurchase also provide us with a short term source of liquidity 
as many of our securities sold under agreements to repurchase are at variable rates  this provided us with a relatively inexpensive source of short term funding in the current interest rate environment 
average rates paid on securities sold under agreements to repurchase were in  a basis point decrease from see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
long term debt long term debt  which represents a relatively more expensive source of funds for us  was million as of december   a million or decrease from december  this decrease was primarily due to the repayment of million in subordinated notes and million in privately placed notes in the first quarter of this was partially offset by the recognition of million in non recourse debt on the balance sheet in the second quarter of the non recourse debt was previously not recognized as a liability on the company s balance sheet under leveraged lease accounting treatment for one of our commercial leases

we understand and evaluate our customers borrowing needs and capacity to repay  in conjunction with their character and history 
commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition  expansion  working capital  and other general business purposes 
lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment 
the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant 
a determination is made as to the applicant s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved 
in addition to an evaluation of the applicant s financial condition  a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment  such as additional collateral or personal guarantees  to be relied upon in the transaction 
credit agency reports of the applicant s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant s creditworthiness 
commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors  developers  builders  and owner occupants primarily domiciled in hawaii 
these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at loan to value ltv ratios deemed appropriate based on the property type  location  overall quality  and sponsorship 
generally  these ltv ratios do not exceed 
the commercial properties are predominantly developments such as retail centers  apartments  industrial properties and  to a lesser extent  more specialized properties such as hotels 
substantially all of our commercial mortgage loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area 
in the underwriting of our commercial mortgage loans  we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties 
decisions to lend are based on the economic fundamentals of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
in evaluating a proposed commercial mortgage loan  we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property s projected net cash flows to the loan s debt service requirement 
the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate 
in addition  a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is sometimes required from the principal s of the borrower 
we normally require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien  fire  and extended coverage casualty insurance  and flood insurance  if appropriate  in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property 
in addition  business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required 
owner occupant commercial mortgage loans are underwritten based upon the cash flow of the business provided that the real estate asset is utilized in the business operation 
real estate is evaluated independently as a secondary source of repayment 
ltv ratios generally do not exceed 
construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income  business income from an owner occupant  or the sale of the property to an end user 
we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed price construction contracts  performance and payment bonding  controlled disbursements  and pre sale contracts or pre lease agreements 
we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest loan category 
these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the consumer 
decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios  debt to income dti ratios  liquidity  and credit score 
ltv ratios generally do not exceed  although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance 
we offer variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first  third  fifth  or seventh year  depending on the product and are based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
variable rate mortgages are underwritten at fully indexed interest rates

automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles 
we originate automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships 
our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant s overall financial capacity and repayment ability  including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
although an applicant s creditworthiness is the primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount 
we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans  with us listed as loss payee 
home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower 
the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permits borrowing availability  in the aggregate  up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination 
we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans  with variable rate loans underwritten at indexed interest rates 
our procedures for underwriting home equity loans include an assessment of an applicant s overall financial capacity and repayment ability 
decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios  dti ratios  liquidity  and credit scores

our overall credit risk position is reflective of the continued weak economy in  with increasing levels of non performing assets compared to december  the decline in visitor arrivals appears to be stabilizing  however  visitor spending continues to be lower than recent years 
the construction and real estate industries in hawaii remain weak 
hawaii s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has improved slightly but was higher in compared to the slower economy in hawaii is resulting in higher delinquencies and loss rates in our loan and lease portfolio  with the primary impact in our commercial and industrial  construction  and mortgage related consumer lending portfolios 
table summarizes the amount of our loan and lease portfolio that demonstrate a higher risk profile  based on our current assessment of risk characteristics 
higher risk loans outstanding table december  dollars in thousands residential home building residential land loans home equity loans air transportation residential home building loans represent million or of our total commercial construction portfolio balance as of december  the higher risk exposure in our residential home building portfolio was million as of december  this included million in projects on hawaiian islands other than oahu of which million was included in non performing assets 
the increase in our higher risk exposure in this portfolio segment in was primarily due to a single regional home builder with operations on oahu that is largely experiencing difficulties in other markets 
residential land loans in our residential mortgage portfolio often represent higher risk due to the volatility in the value of the underlying collateral 
our residential land loan portfolio was million as of december   of which million related to properties on hawaiian islands other than oahu 
the higher risk segment within our hawaii home equity lending portfolio was million or of our total home equity loans outstanding as of december  the higher risk segment within our hawaii home equity portfolio includes those loans originated in or later  with current monitoring credit scores below  and with original ltv ratios greater than 
we also continue to have elevated risk in our air transportation portfolio 
as of december   included in our commercial leasing portfolio were five leveraged leases on aircraft that were originated in the s and prior 
outstanding credit exposure related to these leveraged leases was million as of december  and million as of december  the decrease in our air 
table of contents transportation credit exposure in was primarily due to the sale of our equity interest in a cargo aircraft in the second quarter of and the fourth quarter charge off of our equity interest in two leveraged leases to a lessee that filed for bankruptcy protection 
the two leases that were charged off in the fourth quarter of had been fully reserved for in the allowance as of december  as of december   we also had a million exposure related to one direct financing lease for an aircraft  whose intermediary and guarantor filed for and emerged from bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter of relative to our total loan and lease portfolio  domestic air transportation carriers continue to demonstrate a higher risk profile due to fuel costs  pension plan obligations  consumer demand  and marginal pricing power 
we believe that volatile fuel costs  coupled with a weak economy  could place additional pressure on the financial health of air transportation carriers for the foreseeable future 
these higher risk loans and leases have been considered in our quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance

impaired loans are defined as those which we believe it is probable we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  as well as those loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
impaired loans were million as of december  and million as of december  we had loans whose terms had been modified in a tdr of million as of december   primarily in our consumer automobile and commercial and industrial portfolios 
loans modified in a tdr were primarily the result of the modification of interest rates to below market rates and the extensions of maturity dates 
loans and leases that are days or more past due  as to principal or interest  and still accruing interest are in this category because they are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans and leases past due days or more and still accruing interest were million as of december   a decrease of million from december  the million decrease in commercial loans in this category was primarily due to the refinance of two loans in our pacific islands division in that were in the process of being refinanced as of december  this was partially offset by a million increase in consumer loans in this category  primarily in the areas of residential mortgage and home equity lending 
if interest due on the balances of all non accrual loans including loans that were on non accrual status during but not on non accrual status as of december  had been accrued under the original terms  approximately million in total interest income would have been recorded in  compared to the million recorded as interest income on those loans including recoveries of interest income reversed in prior years

market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
our market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling  and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance  while limiting volatility 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
our trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers 
our other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose our balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk the objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
the potential cash flows  sales  or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities  especially those that earn or pay interest  are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing relationships  and repricing characteristics of financial instruments 
our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the monetary policies of the frb can influence the overall growth of loans  investment securities  and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
in managing interest rate risk  we  through the asset liability management committee alco  measure short and long term sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
the alco utilizes several 
table of contents techniques to manage interest rate risk  which include adjusting balance sheet mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities  changing product pricing strategies  modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio  or using derivative financial instruments 
the use of derivative financial instruments  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  has generally been limited 
this is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans  investment securities with deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by alco 
natural and offsetting hedges reduce the need to employ off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures 
expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk 
thus  as interest rates change  we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk 
a key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset liability simulation model 
the model is used to estimate and measure the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit pricing  repayment rates on mortgage based assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model s analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  we believe that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the simulation model attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet 
we utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
table presents  for the next twelve months subsequent to december    and  an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual change in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve  relative to the measured base case scenario 
the base case scenario assumes the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged 
based on the net interest income simulation as of december   net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  was more sensitive to changes in interest rates as compared to the sensitivity profiles as of december  and  particularly in higher interest rate scenarios 
market conditions remain uncertain at the end of  although they have improved since the end of government intervention has caused interest rates to remain relatively low and has decreased market volatility 
credit spreads have narrowed in and are approaching pre crisis levels 
these factors have contributed to greater interest rate risk to the company as of december  net interest income sensitivity profile table change in net interest income december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points to analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner  non parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated 
these non parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time 
conversely  if the yield curve should steepen further from its mostly normal profile  net interest income may increase 

table of contents we also use the market value of equity mve sensitivity analysis to estimate the net present value change in our net assets ie  assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments from changes in interest rates 
the mve was approximately billion  billion  and billion as of december    and  respectively 
during  market credit spreads significantly increased and as a result the mve as of december  was lower compared to the mve as of december  and in addition  the mve increased as of december  compared to december  due to strong deposit growth in table presents  as of december    and  an estimate of the change in the mve that would result from an instantaneous and basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve 
the mve sensitivity decreased as of december  compared to december  as a result of interest rates increasing and credit spreads decreasing as of december   particularly in lower rate environments where a near interest rate environment will have a marginally positive effect on the mve 
conversely  higher rate scenarios will now have a negative impact to mve 
market value of equity sensitivity profile table change in market value of equity december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points further enhancing the mve sensitivity analysis are value at risk metrics  key rate analysis  duration of equity analysis  and exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures  however  used along with the mve sensitivity analysis  we obtain better overall insight for managing our exposures to changes in interest rates 
based on the additional analyses  we estimate that our greatest exposure is in scenarios where medium term interest rates decrease on a relative basis more than long term interest rates 
liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funds 
funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings  liability issuances and settlements  and off balance sheet funding commitments 
we consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  we may alter our asset  liability  and off balance sheet positions 
the alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs  we actively manage our assets and liabilities 
the potential sources of short term liquidity include interest bearing deposits as well as the ability to sell certain assets including investment securities available for sale 
assets generate long term liquidity through cash flows from investment securities and loans 
with respect to liabilities  short term liquidity is generated from securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term funding sources such as federal funds while long term liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and long term debt 
we continued to strengthen our liquidity position in  with growth in the levels of commercial and 
table of contents consumer deposits 
total deposits were billion as of december   a billion or increase from december  in  we made investments in debt securities issued by the us treasury and in mortgage backed securities issued by government agencies 
these investments in high grade securities with relatively short duration  allows us to maintain flexibility to redeploy funds as such opportunities arise 
in february  we repaid million in fixed rate privately placed notes 
in march  we repaid million in fixed rate subordinated notes 
we do not expect to replace these repayments with new long term debt
