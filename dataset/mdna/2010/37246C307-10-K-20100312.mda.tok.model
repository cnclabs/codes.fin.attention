item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
see item a risk factors regarding certain factors known to genvec that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results  including discussions of the risks related to the development  regulatory approval  manufacture  proprietary protection of our product candidates  and their market success relative to alternative products 
overview genvec  inc genvec  we  our  or the company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel  gene based therapeutic drugs and vaccines 
our lead therapeutic product candidate  tnferade tm biologic tnferade  is being developed for use in the treatment of cancer 
tnferade is currently the subject of a randomized  controlled  phase pivotal trial  known as pact  for first line treatment of inoperable  locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
interim data supporting a potential survival advantage in the tnferade group were disclosed in november interim data  based on an analysis after one third of deaths necessary to complete the trial  demonstrated an approximately lower risk of death in the tnferade plus standard of care soc arm relative to the soc arm alone hazard ratio  confidence interval 
at this time an independent data safety monitoring board reviewed the interim analysis data and recommended the trial continue as planned 
in november  tnferade was granted fast track designation by the us food and drug administration fda for its proposed use in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
in november  the fda granted orphan drug designation for tnferade for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer 
in january  genvec announced that events deaths had occurred in the pact trial 
this event  which represents two thirds of the total events expected in the trial  triggered the next interim analysis of overall survival in the trial 
genvec expects data from this interim analysis to be available in march or april of tnferade is also being evaluated for possible use in the treatment of other types of cancer 
using our core adenovector technology  tnferade stimulates the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf  a known anti tumor protein  in cells of the tumor 
clinical trials have been conducted and encouraging results have previously been reported in studies for esophageal cancer  head and neck cancer  rectal cancer  and soft tissue sarcomas 
we expect to initiate a phase clinical trial in prostate cancer in our core technology has the important advantage of localizing protein delivery in the body 
this is accomplished by using our adenovector platform to locally deliver genes to cells  which then direct production of the desired protein 
in the case of tnferade  for example  this approach reduces side effects typically associated with systemic delivery of the tnf protein 
for vaccines  the goal is to induce a broad immune response against a target protein or antigen 
this is accomplished by using the adenovector to deliver a gene that causes production of an antigen  which then stimulates the desired immune reaction by the body 
our research and development activities have also yielded additional therapeutic product candidates that utilize our technology platform  and we believe they represent potential commercial opportunities 
for example  preclinical research in hearing loss and balance disorders suggests delivery of the atonal gene using genvec s adenovector technology may have the potential to restore hearing and balance function 
we have recently entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with novartis institutes for biomedical research  inc novartis  which focuses on the discovery and development of novel treatments for hearing loss and balance disorders 
there are currently no effective treatments available for patients who have lost all balance function  and hearing loss remains a major unmet medical problem 
in partnership with our collaborators  we also have multiple vaccines in development 
all of these programs are funded by third parties and utilize our core adenovector technology 
one vaccine candidate targets the prevention of a major animal health problem  foot and mouth disease fmd 
development efforts for this program are supported by the us department of homeland security and in collaboration with the us department of agriculture 
we anticipate a conditional license application for a fmd vaccine will be filed in late in addition  we have a collaboration with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid of the national institutes of health nih to develop a human immunodeficiency virus hiv vaccine and an influenza virus vaccine 
we also have a program with the us naval medical research 
table of contents center and the path malaria vaccine initiative to develop vaccines for malaria 
genvec also has grant supported preclinical programs to develop vaccine candidates for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus rsv and herpes simplex virus type hsv 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue  as resources permit  the research and development of a range of product candidates for a variety of indications 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase 
furthermore  our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one or more of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
our programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
furthermore  the current domestic and global economic conditions have made it more difficult for companies like us to access the financial and credit markets 
prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions  such as the current economic conditions  or further disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets will further adversely affect our ability to access additional capital 
while our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and will depend on  and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors  including the extent to which we choose to advance our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities  it is clear we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through clinical development  manufacturing  and commercialization 
the continued advancement of tnferade through the phase portion of the pivotal trial for locally advanced pancreatic cancer  the fda regulatory review process  and the establishment of manufacturing capabilities will continue to require capital  and we expect to have to incur significant additional costs to manufacture and commercialize tnferade if we receive marketing approval 
we do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
our research and development expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses were divided between our research and development platforms in the following manner

year ended december  in millions tnferade vaccines other clinical programs total 
table of contents tnferade 
our lead cancer product candidate is currently being studied in a pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
genvec has incurred million of expenses on the development of this product candidate since the commencement of this program in costs since the commencement of this program include research  development  clinical trials  clinical supply costs  and an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses 
genvec expects to continue to expend substantial additional amounts for the clinical development and commercialization of tnferade 
vaccines 
under our corporate and government funded vaccine programs  genvec continues to develop vaccine candidates against malaria  hiv  rsv  hsv  and other infectious diseases  as well as an animal health vaccine for foot and mouth disease fmd 
since commencement of these vaccine development programs in  genvec has incurred approximately million in research and development costs  including an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  most of which have been funded by various sponsors under cost reimbursement agreements 
to date  none of our proprietary or collaborative programs has resulted in a commercial product  therefore  we have not received any revenues or royalties from the sale of products 
we have funded our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaborative programs with public and private entities  and debt financings 
we have incurred operating losses each year since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and from general and administrative activities 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  sponsored research costs  patent costs  technology access fees  clinical trial costs  and other expenses related to our product development and research programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  facility costs  professional fees  business development costs  insurance premiums  and other general corporate expenditures 
in we took steps to lower our operating costs in order to increase our efficiency 
these steps included eliminating positions during further  where practical  during we minimized our unfunded expenditures on activities that were not critical to the clinical development of tnferade 
to this end  on june   we terminated our agreement with cobra biomanufacturing plc 
we expect that lowering costs  in addition to what we expect will be increased revenues in from funded collaborations  can provide us with at least months of operating capital from the balance sheet date  based on current progress of our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates using authoritative pronouncements  historical experience  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical because they require significant estimates or judgment on the part of management revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when a contract is executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of the service or products has occurred  and collectability of the contract amounts is considered probable 

table of contents our collaborative research and development agreements can provide for upfront license fees  research payments  and or milestone payments 
upfront nonrefundable fees associated with license and development agreements where we have continuing involvement in the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
non refundable research and development fees for which no future performance obligations exist are recognized when collection is assured 
research and development revenue from cost reimbursement and cost plus fixed fee agreements is recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revisions in revenues  cost  and billing factors eg indirect rate estimates are accounted for in the period of change 
reimbursable costs under such contracts are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
contract revenues and accounts receivable reported in the financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be received 
contract revenues are adjusted to actual upon final audit and retroactive adjustment 
estimated contractual allowances are provided based on our evaluation of current contract terms and past experience with disallowed costs and reimbursement levels 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
clinical trial expenses and research and development activities 
we accrue estimated costs for clinical and preclinical studies based on estimates of work performed 
we believe this method best aligns our expenses with the efforts we expend 
we monitor the progress of the trials and their related activities to the extent possible and adjust the accruals accordingly 
adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustment become known  all adjustments to date have been inconsequential 
the expenditures necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines 
spacer

gif 
clinical phase estimated completion date phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
we test potential product candidates in preclinical studies to identify indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation based on the estimated grant date fair value of the stock using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated grant date fair value is recognized in earnings over the requisite service period 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu to address potential practice issues associated with fasb asc formerly sfas  subsequent events 
the asu eliminated the requirement for entities that file or furnish financial statements with the sec to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and reissued financial statements 
other entities would continue to be required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated  however  disclosures about the date would be required only in financial statements revised because of an error correction or retrospective application of us gaap 
our adoption of this standard changed our presentation of subsequent events when preparing our financial statements 
in september  the fasb ratified asu formerly eitf  revenue recognition asc multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  the final consensus reached by the emerging issues task force that revised the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the guidance will be effective for our fiscal year beginning january  with early adoption permitted 
the guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
we currently do not have any multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  accordingly  the adoption of the guidance will not have an impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures asc measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
asu provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets 
the guidance provided is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
our adoption of asu did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asc formerly sfas  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asc 
asc is now the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernment entities 
it also modifies the gaap hierarchy to include only two levels of gaap authoritative and non authoritative 
asc is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of this standard in changed how we reference various elements of us gaap when preparing our financial statement disclosures  but did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after december  are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
see note in our notes to financial statements for information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in is primarily due to decreased revenue associated with our agreement with the department of homeland security dhs of million 
the lower revenue under the dhs agreement is a result of the decreased work scope and effort in as compared to the period 
the decreased revenue associated with our dhs agreement has been partially offset by increased revenue of million under our hiv program as compared to the comparable prior year period 
the higher revenue under our hiv agreements is a result of increased work scope and effort in as compared to the period 

table of contents operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower costs related to the development of tnferade including manufacturing and materials costs  patient and data management costs  professional service costs related to our tnferade pancreatic clinical trial  and decreased personnel costs 
stock based compensation expense included in research and development personnel costs decreased approximately  in as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in severance expenses of approximately  for former employees in as compared to the prior year 
also contributing to the decreased costs  but to a lesser extent  are decreased pass through costs associated with our funded programs  most notably pass through costs associated with our fmd program 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to lower professional service cost and employee costs  partially offset by higher depreciation costs

gain loss on disposal of assets 
there was a gain on the disposal of assets of  in and a gain of  in other income loss total other income decreased from  in to a net loss of  in interest income was  in as compared to  in the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower investment balances and lower yields earned on our portfolio 
interest expense for the period ending december  increased  as compared to the comparable prior year period due to adjustments in the fair value of the warrant liability associated with our committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital ltd 
kingsbridge in as compared to the comparable period in in there was a net expense of  resulting from the changes in fair value of the warrant liability as compared to a net income of  in partially offsetting this increase in interest expense associated with the warrant liability was lower interest expense associated with our debt obligations due to declining balances on those obligations 
other income loss was a loss of  in as compared to a loss of  in the loss in resulted primarily from the expensing of the remaining  of deferred financing charges when our ceff expired on march   partially offset by miscellaneous discounts and interest payments received from the government associated with late payments 
the loss in is due mainly to the recording of a loss associated with an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a marketable equity security acquired in as consideration for the release of certain security interests in a third party of  partially offset by miscellaneous discounts and interest payments received from the government associated with late payments 
years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to increased revenue associated with our agreement with the department of homeland security dhs of million 
the higher revenue under the dhs agreement is a result of increased work scope and effort in as a result of the exercise of the first and second renewal options under the agreement as compared to the period 
the increased revenue associated with our dhs agreement has been partially offset by decreased revenue of million under our hiv program as compared to the comparable prior year period 
this decrease is mostly due to the successful completion of the defined process development  technology transfer  and analytical method transfer activities under our hiv agreements

the income in is due primarily to the receipt of an insurance settlement of  due to a casualty loss  the receipt of equity  valued at  from a third party in exchange for the release of security interests and miscellaneous discounts and interest payments from the government associated with late payments 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant losses since our inception 
as of december  we have an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our product candidates requires significant research and development work and clinical trial work  as well as significant manufacturing and process development efforts 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to continue to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   cash and investments totaled million as compared to million at december  for the months ended december   we used net cash of million for operating activities 
this consisted of a net loss for the period of million  which included approximately million of non cash depreciation and amortization and million of non cash stock based compensation expenses 
net cash was used primarily for the advancement of our tnferade pancreatic clinical trial  including our manufacturing activities  and to a lesser extent general and administrative activities 
net cash provided from investing activities during the months ended december  was million  which included approximately  of property and equipment purchases 

table of contents net cash provided from financing activities during the months ended december  was million  which included million from the issuance of common stock and warrants  net of issuance costs 
partially offsetting the cash provided by our financing activities is the repayment of our debt obligations of approximately  historically we have entered into agreements with academic medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform research and development activities and with clinical sites for the treatment of patients under clinical protocols 
such contracts expire at various dates and have differing renewal and expiration clauses 
we also utilize different financing instruments  such as debt and capital and or operating leases  to finance various equipment and facility needs 
in january  we entered into a manufacturing development agreement with cobra biomanufacturing plc to produce commercial quantities of tnferade  our lead product candidate 
the manufacturing development agreement covered technology transfer  scale up  and validation of the manufacturing process for tnferade through cgmp consistency lots 
this advance payment was capitalized as a nonrefundable advance payment until the related services were performed 
as of december    of the million advance payment remained in prepaid and other assets 
in march  we entered into a letter agreement amending the original agreement and the associated services 
during the first quarter of  we paid and expensed million for access to the cobra facility under the original cobra agreement and the letter agreement amending the original agreement 
as of the date of the amendment  we also waived our rights to amounts remaining unused relating to the advanced payment 
as a result  in march we expensed the remaining  of the advance payment 
during the second quarter of  we paid and expensed an additional million for access to the cobra facility in accordance with the letter agreement amending the original cobra agreement 
effective june   pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement  we terminated the agreement and its associated services schedule with cobra and paid cobra a termination fee of  all amounts paid to cobra were charged to expense during the six months ending june  we incurred no further expense associated with this agreement after june  and have no additional commitments under this agreement

total payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases    total contractual obligations   on march   we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge  under which kingsbridge committed to purchase up to million of our common stock within a three year period  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
during the three year term of the ceff  which expired on march   we sold  shares of common stock to kingsbridge for total gross proceeds of million 
no shares were sold during under the ceff 
on february   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a million shelf registration statement on form s the shelf registration statement was declared effective february  and allows us to issue any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  or debt securities 
we have previously issued common stock  warrants and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants for aggregate proceeds of million  which leaves approximately million available for issuance pursuant to the shelf registration statement 
however  we have warrants outstanding under which an additional million of common stock may be issued pursuant to the registration statement 
accordingly  we would likely only use for new offerings approximately million of the million that is currently available for issuance 
this shelf registration was scheduled to expire on february   however  because we filed 
table of contents a million replacement shelf registration statement  which is not yet effective  before that date  we may continue to offer and sell securities covered by the shelf registration statement until the earlier of the effective date of the replacement registration statement or days after the third anniversary of the initial effective date of the expired registration statement 
the replacement registration statement  once it is declared effective  will allow us to issue any combination of common stock  preferred stock  or warrants to purchase our common stock or preferred stock 
on june   pursuant to our shelf registration statement  we completed a registered direct offering to various investors of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the shares of common stock and warrants were offered in units consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a per unit price of

in march  the institutional investor exercised warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for gross proceeds to the company of million 
on september  we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market stating that the minimum bid price of the company s common stock was below per share for consecutive business days and that the company was therefore not in compliance with marketplace rule on january  we received a letter from the nasdaq advising we had regained compliance with the nasdaq s minimum bid price listing requirements and the matter was closed 
on january  we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with novartis institutes for biomedical research  inc novartis to discover and develop novel treatments for hearing loss and balance disorders 
under the terms of the agreement  we licensed the world wide rights to our preclinical hearing loss and balance disorders program to novartis 
concurrent with entry into the agreement with novartis  we sold  shares of our common stock to novartis pharma ag in a private placement for per share of common stock  which represents an aggregate purchase price of approximately million and was calculated based on the average of the closing price for the common stock on the nasdaq global market for the consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day prior to the sale of the shares 
the purchase of the shares of common stock by novartis pharma ag was undertaken in partial consideration for the rights granted under the research collaboration and license agreement

our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could change materially as a result of many factors  including the progress of our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
we have also taken and are continuing to take steps to lower our operating costs in order to increase our efficiency 
these steps included our announcement on january  that we eliminated positions 
we currently estimate we will use approximately to million of cash in the months ending december  our estimate includes approximately million in contractual obligations reflected in the table above  as well as million for capital expenditures 
based on this estimate we have sufficient resources to fund our operations for at least months from the balance sheet date 
however  significant additional capital will be required to develop our product candidates through clinical development  manufacturing  and commercialization  including the continued advancement of tnferade through the phase portion of the pivotal trial for locally advanced pancreatic cancer  the fda regulatory review process for tnferade and the establishment of manufacturing capabilities for tnferade 
we may seek additional capital through further public or private equity offerings  debt financing  additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  collaborative arrangements  or some combination of these financing alternatives 
the current domestic and global economic conditions have made it more difficult for companies like us to access the financial and credit markets  and have made it more likely we will have to pursue additional strategic alliances  licensing arrangements or collaborations for our product candidates  including for tnferade 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  investors will likely experience dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  those securities would have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we seek strategic alliances  licenses  or other alternative arrangements  such as arrangements with collaborative partners or others  we may need to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies  product candidates  or products we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  or to license the rights to our technologies  product candidates  or products on terms that are not favorable to us 
the overall status of the economic climate could also result in the terms of any equity offering  debt financing  or alliance  license or other arrangement being less favorable to us and our stockholders than if the overall economic climate were stronger 
we also will continue to look for government sponsored research collaborations and grants to help offset future anticipated losses from operations  as we expect to continue to rely on government funding for a significant portion of our revenues for the next few years and  to a lesser extent  interest income 
if adequate funds are not available through either the capital markets  strategic alliances  or collaborators  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research  development  clinical programs  manufacturing  or commercialization efforts  effect additional changes to our facilities or personnel  or obtain funds through other arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies  product candidates  or products on terms not favorable to us 
off balance sheet obligations we had no off balance sheet obligations other than in connection with our operating leases  which are disclosed in the contractual commitments table above during
