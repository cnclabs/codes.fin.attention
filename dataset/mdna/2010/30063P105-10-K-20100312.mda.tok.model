item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview exact sciences corporation is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer 
we have exclusive intellectual property protecting our non invasive  molecular screening technology for the detection of colorectal cancer 
our primary goal is to become the market leader for a patient friendly diagnostic screening product for the early detection of colorectal pre cancer and cancer 
our current focus is on the commercial development and seeking us food and drug administration fda clearance and approval of our stool based dna  or sdna  colorectal cancer screening product 
we believe obtaining fda approval is critical to building broad demand and successful commercialization for our sdna colorectal cancer screening technologies 
it is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable  yet least prevented cancers 
colorectal cancer typically takes up to years to progress from a pre cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death 
however  it is the second leading cause of cancer death in the united states  killing almost  people each year 
our sdna  screening test is designed to detect pre cancerous lesions or polyps  and each of the four stages of colorectal cancer 
pre cancerous polyps are present in approximately percent of the population over years of age in the united states 
there is a significant unmet clinical need related to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer 
only percent of those who should be screened for colorectal cancer are screened according to current guidelines 
half of those age years and older have not been screened at all 
poor compliance has meant that nearly two thirds of colon cancer diagnoses are made in the disease s late stages 
the five year survival rates for stages and are percent and percent  respectively 
our sdna screening test can detect pre cancers and cancers early  and is expected to be a powerful  preventive tool 
by detecting pre cancers and cancers early with the sdna based test  affected patients can be referred to colonoscopy  during which the polyp or lesion can be removed 
the sdna screening model has the potential to significantly reduce colorectal cancer deaths 
the earlier the pre cancer or cancer can be detected  the greater the reduction in mortality 
the competitive landscape is favorable to sdna based screening 
all of the colorectal cancer detection methods in use today are constrained by some combination of poor sensitivity  poor compliance and cost 
colonoscopy is uncomfortable and expensive 
fifty five percent of the patients who responded to one recent study said that colonoscopy was very unacceptable or unacceptable 
fecal blood testing suffers from poor sensitivity  including percent detection rates for cancer and percent detection rates for pre cancers 
blood based dna testing also is disadvantaged by its sensitivity 
data from a clinical trial of one blood based test was released earlier this year 
it demonstrated only percent sensitivity across all stages of cancer 
the competitive advantages of sdna based screening provide a massive market opportunity 
assuming a percent test adoption rate and a three year screening interval  the potential us market for sdna screening is billion 
the total available us market is more than billion 

table of contents the benefits of sdna based screening are clear 
it detects both pre cancers and cancers  at target sensitivities greater than percent and percent  respectively 
sdna based screening is non invasive and requires no bowel preparation or dietary restriction like other methods 
the sample for sdna based screening can be collected easily at home and mailed to the appropriate laboratory  where the testing would be conducted 
sdna based screening also is affordable  particularly relative to colonoscopy 
our intellectual property portfolio positions us as the leading player in the sdna market 
our patent estate broadly protects our position in the market  including the platform technology  methods and biomarkers 
in we expanded our intellectual property estate through our collaboration with the mayo clinic 
we had previously licensed on an exclusive basis johns hopkins digital pcr technologies for colon cancer detection  as well as case western s important vimentin dna methylation marker 
in  we also licensed the hologic inc s invader detection chemistry  which we plan to incorporate into our test 
we have generated limited operating revenues since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
losses have historically resulted from costs incurred in conjunction with research  development and clinical study initiatives  salaries and benefits associated with the hiring of personnel  the initiation of marketing programs  and prior to august   the build out of our sales infrastructure to support the commercialization of sdna screening 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years  and it is possible we may never achieve profitability 
management during we assembled a new management team with significant experience in molecular oncology diagnostics 
kevin t 
conroy was elected a member of our board of directors in march and appointed our president and chief executive officer in april maneesh arora was appointed as our senior vice president and chief financial officer in april mr 
conroy and mr 
arora previously served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer  respectively  at third wave technologies  inc  a leading molecular diagnostics company which was acquired for million by hologic  inc in june in august  we hired dr 
graham lidgard as senior vice president and chief science officer 
dr lidgard brings more than decades of clinical diagnostic experience to exact 
his experience covers both immunoassay and molecular diagnostics  from pioneering chemiluminescent magnetic particle immunoassay at ciba corning  to leading the research and development for the procleix hiv hcv blood screening assays  the aptima combo std assays and the tigris automated nucleic acid instrument at gen probe 
in august  we entered into a new employment agreement with dr

he joined exact in as vp of laboratory medicine following a long career as the director of pathology and laboratory medicine for a million member mco  harvard pilgrim healthcare boston  ma 
financial overview revenue our revenue is comprised of the amortization of up front license fees for the licensing of certain patent rights to labcorp and genzyme and product royalty fees on tests sold by labcorp utilizing our 
table of contents technology 
we expect that product royalty fees for the full year will be consistent with amounts recorded in we expect that license fee revenue resulting from the amortization of the up front license payment from labcorp and genzyme in will be higher than amounts recorded in as a result of a full year of revenue from the genzyme transaction and from the expected receipt of holdback amounts from genzyme during our cost structure our general and administrative expenses have consisted primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses  professional fees and  non cash stock based compensation 
effective august   we eliminated our sales and marketing functions and therefore  did not incur any sales and marketing expenses in we incurred sales and marketing expenses of million in as a result of increased sales and marketing activities in support of developing an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test for the early detection and prevention of colon cancer 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  certain third party royalty obligations  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe that that the following accounting policies and judgments are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition 
license fees 
license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
on june   we entered into an amendment to our exclusive license agreement with labcorp  which  among other modifications to the terms of the license  extended the exclusive license period of the license with labcorp from august through december accordingly  we are amortizing the remaining deferred revenue balance at the time of the amendment million on a straight line basis over the remaining exclusive license period  which ends in december in connection with our january strategic transaction with genzyme  genzyme agreed to pay us a total of million  of which million was paid at closing and million is subject to a holdback by genzyme to satisfy certain potential indemnification obligations in exchange for the assignment and licensing of certain intellectual property to genzyme 
our on going performance obligations to genzyme under the collaboration  license and purchase agreement the clp agreement  as described below  including our obligation to deliver certain intellectual property improvements to genzyme during the initial five year collaboration period  were deemed to be undelivered elements of the clp agreement on the date of closing 
accordingly  we deferred the initial 
table of contents million in cash received at closing and are amortizing that up front payment on a straight line basis into revenue over the initial five year collaboration period ending in january receipt of any holdback amounts  as defined below  will similarly be deferred and amortized on a straight line basis into revenue over the remaining term of the collaboration at the time of receipt 
in addition  genzyme paid per share for the  shares of our common stock purchased on january   representing a premium of per share above the closing price of our common stock on that date of per share 
the aggregate premium paid by genzyme over the closing price of our common stock on the date of the transaction of million is deemed to be a part of the total consideration for the clp agreement 
accordingly  we deferred the aggregate million premium and are amortizing that amount on a straight line basis into revenue over the initial five year collaboration period ending in january we recognized approximately million in license fee revenue in connection with the amortization of the up front payments from genzyme during the year ended december  other revenue 
revenue from milestone and other performance based payments is recognized as revenue when the milestone or performance is achieved and collection of the receivable is estimable and probable based on specific agreements and circumstances 
stock based compensation 
in accordance with gaap  all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan if certain parameters are not met  are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
the following assumptions are used in determining the fair value of stock option grants valuation and recognition the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated fair value of employee stock options is recognized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
expected term the company uses the simplified calculation of expected term  described in the sec s staff accounting bulletin and  as the company does not currently have sufficient historical exercise data on which to base an estimate of expected term 
using this method  the expected term is determined using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted 
expected volatility expected volatility is based on the company s historical stock volatility data over the expected term of the awards 
risk free interest rate the company bases the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
forfeitures the company records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
no forfeiture rate was utilized for awards granted prior to due to the monthly vesting terms of the options granted in that timeframe 
because of the vesting terms  the company was  in effect  recording stock based compensation only for those awards that were vesting and expected to vest and a forfeiture rate was not necessary 
awards granted in that vest annually are all expected to vest and no forfeiture rate was utilized 
critical accounting estimate third party royalty obligation pursuant to the terms of the agreement the company has with labcorp  we agreed to reimburse labcorp million for certain third party royalty payments 
as of december  we had paid million in payments to labcorp 
we will be required to pay at a maximum the remaining million balance in january of based on anticipated sales volumes of colosure  as of 
table of contents december   we accrued a total of  related to the total potential remaining million obligation to labcorp 
we recorded charges of  and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  in connection with this third party royalty obligation 
these charges were recorded under the caption product royalty fees in our consolidated statements of operations 
future increases in this obligation  to the extent necessary  will continue to be recorded as charges to the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standards codification  generally accepted accounting principles 
fasb asc approved the fasb accounting standards codification asc as the source of authoritative nongovernmental gaap 
all existing accounting standards have been superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the fasb asc will be considered non authoritative 
fasb asc is effective for financial statements issued for interim or annual periods ending after september  accordingly  all references to accounting standards have been conformed to the new asc hierarchy 
on april   the fasb issued fasb asc financial instruments and fasb asc interim reporting 
fasb asc requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
fasb asc also amends fasb asc  interim reporting  to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
the adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
on may   the fasb issued fasb asc  subsequent events fasb asc 
fasb asc establishes principles and requirements for subsequent events  in particular i the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity shall evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  ii the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and iii the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in september  the eitf issued their final consensus for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  as codified in asc  revenue recognition 
when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  asc will require the company to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
additionally  this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fee payments associated with our amended license agreement with labcorp and our collaboration  license and purchase agreement with genzyme 
the unamortized labcorp up front payment is being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining exclusive license period  which ends in december the unamortized genzyme up front payment is being amortized on a straight line basis over the initial genzyme collaboration period  which ends in 
table of contents january revenues also include royalties on labcorp s sales of pregen plus and colosure and sales of effipure units to labcorp as well as charges for our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp which are recorded as reductions to revenue under financial accounting guidance 
effective june   labcorp stopped offering pregen plus and informed us that it had discontinued its use of effipure 
the increase in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period of was primarily the result of an increase in license fee revenue of million resulting from the genzyme strategic transaction 
in addition  product royalty fees were approximately million higher for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  due primarily to charges of million recorded during in the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations in connection with our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp 
these charges to product royalty revenue resulted in negative product royalty revenue for the year ended december  we recorded charges of  during the year ended december  in the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations in connection with our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increased research and development activities in support of our efforts to develop an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test for the early detection and prevention of colon cancer 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   included increases of million in licensing costs of which million was non cash stock based expenses related to common stock warrants issued to the mayo clinic foundation  million in personnel related expenses and million in research collaboration expenses which were partially offset by a decrease in other research and development expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of million in transaction costs related to the genzyme strategic transaction in january  including million in legal  audit  and investment banking fees as well as approximately million in retention bonus payments made to employees pursuant to board approved retention agreements 
the overall increase was also due to an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of million in compared to  as well as an increase of million in salary  benefit and other costs due to million in severance payments for our former chief executive officer and chief financial officer and increased headcount during the year ended december   as compared to the same period of these increases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by decreases of million in legal and professional fees  and million other general and administrative costs 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from none in as a result of increased sales and marketing efforts and activities in support of developing an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test for the early detection and prevention of colon cancer 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to less favorable interest rates for cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of 
table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in total revenue was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately million in license fee revenue resulting from the june extension of the exclusive period under our license agreement with labcorp from august to december as a result of this extension  the remaining unamortized up front license fees that labcorp previously paid to us are being recognized over a longer period of time  resulting in lower non cash license fee amortization as compared to prior periods 
a million increase in negative product royalty revenue due to our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp also contributed to the decline in revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of the continuing effect of the cost reduction plans undertaken in and described below 
the decrease in research and development expenses  included decreases of million in licensing costs  million in lab related operating expenses  million in personnel related expenses  and million in non cash stock based expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of million as well as a decrease of million in salary  benefit and other costs due to lower general and administrative headcount 
the decrease in non cash stock based compensation was due primarily to the non recurrence of one time non cash stock based compensation charges of million taken in the third quarter of related to the acceleration and the extension of the expiration date of certain stock options held by don m 
hardison  our former president and chief executive officer  pursuant to a separation agreement between us and mr 
hardison in connection with his resignation in august these decreases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by an increase of million in professional fees in connection with our strategic review process  our reimbursement efforts with cms and our regulatory efforts with the fda 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the elimination of our sales and marketing functions effective august   as described under the heading restructuring below 
restructuring 
in july  we took actions to reduce our cost structure to help preserve our cash resources  which we refer to as the restructuring 
these actions included suspending the clinical validation study of our version technology  eliminating eight positions  or of our staff  and seeking the re negotiation of certain fixed commitments 
in connection with the restructuring and our cost reduction efforts  in december  we entered into a sublease agreement  with qteros  inc to sublease to qteros the majority of the remaining space at our former corporate headquarters in marlborough  massachusetts 

table of contents in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million during the three months ended september   including million in one time termination benefits arising under retention and severance agreements with terminated employees and million resulting from the write off of leasehold improvements abandoned by us in connection with the reduction in force 
our decision to eliminate of our workforce as part of the restructuring was deemed to be an impairment indicator under financial accounting standards 
as a result of performing the impairment evaluations  non cash asset impairment charges of million were recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related leasehold improvements to their net realizable value 
amounts remaining in the restructuring accrual at december   which are expected to be paid out in cash through july  are recorded under the caption accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following table summarizes changes made to the restructuring accrual during the year ended december  relating to the restructuring 
amounts included in the table are in thousands 
type of liability balance  december  charges cash payments non cash write offs balance  december  employee separation costs facility consolidation costs total restructuring 
in july  we initiated cost reduction plans and reduced our workforce and other operating expenses  which we refer to as the restructuring  to help preserve our cash resources 
as part of the restructuring  we eliminated our sales and marketing functions  terminated six employees  and subleased a portion of our leased space at our corporate headquarters 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million during the three months ended september   related to one time termination benefits arising under retention and severance agreements with terminated employees  including million in severance and related benefit costs which were paid in cash through may  and million in non cash stock based compensation charges associated with extending the period of exercise for vested stock option awards for terminated employees 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a sublease agreement  which we refer to as the sublease agreement with intrinsix corporation  or intrisix  to sublease to the intrinsix approximately  square feet of rentable area in our corporate headquarters 
amounts remaining in the restructuring accrual at december   which are expected to be paid out through july   are recorded under the caption accrued expenses in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
the following table summarizes the restructuring activities during the year ended december  amounts included in the table are in thousands 
type of liability balance  december  charges cash payments non cash write offs balance  december  employee separation costs facility consolidation costs total the charges outlined in the table above exclude million in non cash stock based compensation expense recorded in connection with the stock option modifications discussed above 

table of contents interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of  as well as less favorable interest rates on investments held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private and public offerings of our equity securities  cash received from labcorp in connection with our license agreement  and cash received in january from genzyme in connection with the genzyme strategic transaction 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and million in restricted cash  which has been pledged as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
as of december  we had approximately million in marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended december   and was to fund our net loss 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due to increased research and development activities and to million paid to labcorp related to our third party royalty obligation 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to decreases in research and development and sales and marketing spending as a result of multiple restructuring and cost reduction actions taken during and cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in our operations  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  when compared to the same periods in and was the result of purchases of marketable securities being greater than maturities of marketable securities during the year 
excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  purchases of property and equipment of approximately million during the year ended december  were significantly higher than purchases of property and equipment for the years ended december  and as a result of increased research and development activities combined with the cost reduction efforts undertaken in and net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of cash receipts from sales of fully depreciated equipment in connection with our sublease agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to proceeds of 
table of contents million from the genzyme strategic transaction  million from the sale of common stock  million from long term debt  and million from exercise of common stock options 
we expect that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months  based on current operating plans 
however  since we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue  we will need to raise additional capital to fully fund our current strategic plan  the centerpiece of which is the commercialization of our sdna technology through completion of the development of an fda approved in vitro diagnostic test for sdna colorectal pre cancer and cancer screening 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds to enable us to fund our operations through the completion of such plan  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected and we may be required to delay the implementation of our plan and otherwise scale back our operations 
even if we successfully raise sufficient funds to complete our plan  we cannot assure you that our business will ever generate sufficient cash flow from operations to become profitable 
the table below reflects our estimated fixed obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period description total less than one year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations obligations under license and collaborative agreements operating lease obligations severance obligations total we have entered into several license and collaborative agreements with johns hopkins university  the mayo foundation  genzyme  and hologic  inc see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information 
includes expected interest payments related to long term debt obligations 
commitments under license agreements generally expire concurrent with the expiration of the intellectual property licensed from the third party 
operating leases reflect remaining obligations associated with leased facilities in marlborough  massachusetts and our headquarters in madison  wisconsin 
severance obligations represent remaining commitments to personnel terminated in connection with the change in management team in march of net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss and research tax carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation s utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on 
table of contents their ability to generate sufficient future income in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in securities of the us governments and its agencies and in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of commercial paper  bank certificates of deposit and corporate bonds  all of which are currently invested in the us and  as of december   were classified as available for sale 
we held no investments at december  we place our cash equivalents and marketable securities with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore are not presently subject to foreign exchange risk 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
