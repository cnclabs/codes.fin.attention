item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  unless otherwise indicated the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview general we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on may  our investment objective is to achieve a high level of current income by investing in debt securities  consisting primarily of senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  of established private businesses that are substantially owned by leveraged buyout funds  individual investors or are family owned businesses  with a particular focus on senior notes 
in addition  we may acquire from other funds existing loans that meet this profile 
we also seek to provide our stockholders with long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that we may receive when we make loans 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company bdc under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
in addition  for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ric under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
we seek to invest in small and medium sized private us businesses that meet certain criteria  including some but not all of the following the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the borrower  a public offering of the borrower s stock or by exercising our right to require the borrower to repurchase our warrants  though there can be no assurance that we will always have these rights 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
business environment while economic conditions generally appear to be improving somewhat  we remain cautious about a long term economic recovery 
the recent recession generally  and the disruptions in the capital markets in particular  have decreased liquidity and increased our cost of debt and equity capital  where available 
the longer these uncertain conditions persist  the greater the probability that these factors could continue to increase our costs of  and significantly limit our access to  debt and equity capital and  thus  have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
many of our portfolio companies  as well as those that we evaluate for investment  are impacted by these economic conditions  and if these conditions persist  it may affect their ability to repay our loans or engage in a liquidity event  such as a sale  recapitalization or initial public offering 
while these conditions are challenging  we have observed an increase in the number of opportunities for new investments consistent with our investing strategy of providing senior term loans to small and medium sized companies 
challenges in the current market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the code and the act  as well as contractual restrictions under the agreement governing our credit facility that further constrain our ability to access the capital markets 
to maintain our qualification as a ric  we must satisfy  among other requirements  an annual distribution requirement to pay out at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
because we are required to distribute our income in this manner  and because the illiquidity of many of our investments makes it difficult for us to finance new investments through the sale of current investments  our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing 
our external financing sources include the issuance of equity securities  debt securities or other leverage such as borrowings under our line of credit 
our ability to seek external debt financing  to the extent that it is available under current market conditions  is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the act  which require us to have at least a asset coverage ratio  meaning generally that for every dollar of debt  we must have two dollars of assets 
market conditions have affected the trading price of our common stock and our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity 
when our stock is trading below net asset value nav per share  as it has consistently traded for more than a year  our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the act which generally prohibit the issuance and sale of our common stock below nav per share without stockholder approval other than through sales to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on february   stockholders approved a proposal which authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current nav per share for a period of one year from the date of approval  provided that our board of directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale 
on november   the closing market price of our common stock was  a discount to our september  nav per share 
at the upcoming annual stockholders meeting scheduled for february   our stockholders will again be asked to vote in favor of renewing this proposal for another year 
the unstable economic conditions may also continue to decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans  as well as the value of our equity investments  which has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
additionally  our credit facility contains covenants regarding the maintenance of certain minimum net worth requirements which are affected by the decrease in value of our portfolio 
failure to meet these requirements would result in a default which  if we are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders  would result in the acceleration of our repayment obligations under our credit facility 
as of september   we were in compliance with all of the facility covenants 
we expect that  given these regulatory and contractual constraints in combination with current market conditions  debt and equity capital may be costly or difficult for us to access 
however  we believe that our entry into a new  credit facility with a two year term discussed in detail further below in financing highlights increases our ability to make new investments consistent with our strategy of making conservative investments in businesses that we believe will weather the current economic conditions and will be likely to produce attractive long term returns for our stockholders 
syndicated loan valuations in monitoring the market activity during the year ended september   we noted market conditions indicating continued liquidity and a better functioning secondary market for syndicated loans 
therefore  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  and following our valuation procedures which specify the use of third party indicative bid quotes for valuing syndicated loans where there is a liquid public market for those loans and market pricing quotes are readily available  third party bid quotes were used to value the syndicated loans as of september  while there is some liquidity in the public market  other factors exist that cause us to believe that the third party indicative bid quotes are not representative of level inputs 
investment highlights purchases during the year ended september   we extended  of investments to three new portfolio companies and  of investments to existing portfolio companies through revolver draws or the additions of new term notes  for total investments of  repayments during the year ended september   eight borrowers made unscheduled full payoffs of  one borrower made an unscheduled partial payoff of and we experienced contractual amortization  revolver repayments and some principal payments received ahead of schedule for an aggregate of  for total principal repayments of  sales during the year ended september   we sold three syndicated loans which resulted in our exit from three portfolio companies for an aggregate of  in net proceeds 
in addition  we wrote off our investment in western directories  which had a cost basis of  since our initial public offering in august  we have made different loans to  or investments in  companies for a total of approximately  before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures 
financing highlights on march   through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone business loan  llc business loan  we entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement  which provides for a  revolving line of credit arranged by key equipment finance inc as administrative agent the credit facility 
branch banking and trust company and ing capital llc also joined the credit facility as committed lenders 
subject to certain terms and conditions  the credit facility may be expanded up to million through the addition of other committed lenders to the facility 
the credit facility matures on march   and  if the facility is not renewed or extended by this date  all unpaid principal and interest will be due and payable one year thereafter on march  advances under the credit facility initially bore interest at the day libor subject to a minimum rate of  plus per annum  with a commitment fee of per annum on undrawn amounts 
however  on november  the amendment date  we amended our credit facility such that advances bear interest at the day libor subject to a minimum rate of  plus per annum  with a commitment fee of per annum on undrawn amounts when the facility is drawn more than and per annum on undrawn amounts when the facility is drawn less than 
in addition to the annual interest rate on borrowings outstanding  under the terms of the credit facility prior to the amendment date  we were obligated to pay an annual minimum earnings shortfall fee to the committed lenders on march   which was calculated as the difference between the weighted average of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and of the commitment amount of the credit facility  multiplied by per annum  less commitment fees paid during the year 
however  as a result of the amendment to the credit facility  we are no longer obligated to pay an annual minimum earnings shortfall fee 
as of september   we had accrued approximately in minimum earnings shortfall fees 
on the amendment date  we paid a fee 
during the year ended september   we elected to apply asc  financial instruments  specifically to our credit facility  which requires us to apply a fair value methodology to the credit facility as of september  the credit facility was fair valued at  as of september  investment strategy our strategy is to make loans at favorable interest rates to small and medium sized businesses 
our loans typically range from million to million  although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes  generally mature in no more than seven years and accrue interest at fixed or variable rates 
because the majority of our portfolio loans consist of term debt of private companies that typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency  we expect that most  if not all  of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated 
we cannot accurately predict what ratings these loans might receive if they were rated  and thus cannot determine whether or not they could be considered investment grade quality 
some of our loans may contain a provision that calls for some portion of the interest payments to be deferred and added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind pik interest and  when earned  we record pik interest as interest income and add the pik interest to the principal balance of the loans 
we seek to avoid pik interest with all potential investments under review 
as of september   one investment bore pik interest 
to the extent possible  our loans generally are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments are generally made monthly or quarterly except to the extent of any pik interest with amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years 
the principal amount of the loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at maturity at five to seven years 
when we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a borrower in connection with a loan  the warrant will typically have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the portfolio company s common stock at the time of the loan and entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock 
original issue discount oid arises when we extend a loan and receive an equity interest in the borrower at the same time 
to the extent that the price paid for the equity is not at market value  we must allocate part of the price paid for the loan  to the value of the equity 
then the amount allocated to the equity  the oid  must be amortized over the life of the loan 
as with pik interest  the amortization of oid also produces income that must be recognized for purposes of satisfying the distribution requirements for a ric under subchapter m of the code  whereas the cash is received  if at all  when the equity instrument is sold 
we seek to avoid oid with all potential investments under review 
as of september   we had four loans with oid income 
in addition  as a bdc under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
our investment adviser  gladstone management corporation the adviser provides these services on our behalf through its officers who are also our officers 
currently  neither we nor our adviser charges a fee for managerial assistance  however  if our adviser does receive fees for managerial assistance  our adviser will credit the managerial assistance fees to the base management fee due from us to our adviser 
our adviser receives fees for the other services it provides to our portfolio companies 
these other fees are typically non recurring  are recognized as revenue when earned and are generally paid directly to our adviser by the borrower or potential borrower upon the closing of the investment 
the services our adviser provides to our portfolio companies vary by investment  but generally include a broad array of services  such as investment banking services  arranging bank and equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders and investors  reviewing existing credit facilities  restructuring existing investments  raising equity and debt capital from other investors  turnaround management  merger and acquisition services and recruiting new management personnel 
when our adviser receives fees for these services  of certain of those fees are credited against the base management fee that we pay to our adviser 
any services of this nature subsequent to closing would typically generate a separate fee at the time of completion 
our adviser also receives fees for monitoring and reviewing portfolio company investments 
these fees are recurring and are generally paid annually or quarterly in advance to our adviser throughout the life of the investment 
fees of this nature are recorded as revenue by our adviser when earned and are not credited against the base management fee 
we may receive fees for the origination and closing services we provide to portfolio companies through our adviser 
these fees are paid directly to us and are recognized as revenue upon closing of the originated investment and are reported as fee income in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to making an investment  we ordinarily enter into a non binding term sheet with the potential borrower 
these non binding term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions  including  but not limited to  the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the potential borrower s business  reaching agreement on the legal documentation for the loan  and the receipt of all necessary consents 
upon execution of the non binding term sheet  the potential borrower generally pays the adviser a non refundable fee for services rendered by the adviser through the date of the non binding term sheet 
these fees are received by the adviser and are offset against the base management fee payable to the adviser  which has the effect of reducing our expenses to the extent of any such fees received by the adviser 
in the event that we expend significant effort in considering and negotiating a potential investment that ultimately is not consummated  we generally will seek reimbursement from the proposed borrower for our reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the transaction  including legal fees 
any amounts collected for expenses incurred by the adviser in connection with unconsummated investments will be reimbursed to the adviser 
amounts collected for these expenses incurred by us will be reimbursed to us and will be recognized in the period in which such reimbursement is received  however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in collecting any such reimbursements

in the future  our adviser may provide investment advisory and administrative services to other funds  both public and private  of which it is the sponsor 
investment advisory and management agreement under the amended and restated investment advisory agreement advisory agreement  we pay our adviser an annual base management fee of of our average gross assets  which is defined as total assets  including investments made with proceeds of borrowings  less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings  valued at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter 
we also pay our adviser a two part incentive fee under the advisory agreement 
the first part of the incentive fee is an income based incentive fee which rewards our adviser if our quarterly net investment income before giving effect to any incentive fee exceeds of our net assets the hurdle rate 
the second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains based incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year or upon termination of the advisory agreement  as of the termination date  and equals of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year 
in determining the capital gains based incentive fee payable to our adviser  we will calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception  and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation  as applicable  with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio 
the adviser did not earn the capital gains based portion of the incentive fee for the fiscal year ended september  we pay our direct expenses including  but not limited to  directors fees  legal and accounting fees  stockholder related expenses  and directors and officers insurance under the advisory agreement 
beginning in april  our board of directors has accepted from the adviser  unconditional and irrevocable voluntarily waivers on a quarterly basis to reduce the annual base management fee on senior syndicated loans to to the extent that proceeds resulting from borrowings were used to purchase such syndicated loan participations 
in addition to the base management and incentive fees under the advisory agreement  of certain fees received by the adviser from our portfolio companies are credited against the investment advisory fee and paid to the adviser

our allocable portion of expenses is derived by multiplying our administrator s total expenses by the percentage of our average assets the total assets at the beginning of each quarter in comparison to the average total assets of all companies managed by our adviser under similar agreements 
on july   our board of directors approved the renewal of this administration agreement through august  we expect that the board of directors will consider a further one year renewal in july results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and a comparison of our operating results for the fiscal years ended september  and is below for the year ended september  change change investment income interest income non control non affiliate investments control investments cash notes receivable from employees total interest income other income total investment income expenses loan servicing fee refer to note base management fee refer to note incentive fee refer to note administration fee refer to note interest expense amortization of deferred financing fees professional fees compensation expense refer to note nm other expenses expenses before credit from adviser credit to fees from adviser refer to note total expenses net of credit to credits to fees net investment income realized and unrealized loss on net realized loss on investments net unrealized appreciation on investments realized loss on settlement of derivative net unrealized appreciation on derivative net unrealized appreciation on borrowings under line of credit nm net loss on investments  derivative and borrowings under line of credit net increase in net assets resulting from operations nm not meaningful investment income investment income for the year ended september  was  as compared to  for the year ended september  interest income from our aggregate investment portfolio decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
the level of interest income from investments is directly related to the balance  at cost  of the interest bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the year multiplied by the weighted average yield 
the weighted average yield varies from year to year based on the current stated interest rate on interest bearing investments and the amounts of loans for which interest is not accruing 
interest income from our investments decreased primarily due to the overall reduction in the cost basis of our investments  resulting primarily from the exit of investments during the year ended september  the annualized weighted average yield on our portfolio was for the year ended september  as compared to for the prior year 
as of september   six investments were on non accrual  for an aggregate of approximately  at cost  or of the aggregate cost of our investment portfolio and as of september   five investments were on non accrual  for an aggregate of approximately  at cost  or of the aggregate cost of our investment portfolio 
interest income from non control non affiliate investments decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year  primarily from an overall decrease in the aggregate cost basis of our non control non affiliate investments during the year 
interest income from control investments increased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
the increase was attributable to the control investments mainly defiance and midwest metal held for the entire year ended september   where those same investments were held for only a portion of the year ended september  interest income from invested cash was nominal for the years ended september  and interest income from loans to employees  in connection with the exercise of employee stock options  decreased slightly for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year due to principal payments on the employee loans during the year ended september  in addition  during the year ended september   of an employee stock option loan to a former employee of the adviser was transferred from notes receivable employees to other assets in connection with the termination of her employment with the adviser and the later amendment of the loan

operating expenses operating expenses  net of credits from the adviser for fees earned and voluntary irrevocable and unconditional waivers to the base management and incentive fees  decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees incurred in connection with the credit facility  which were partially offset by an increase in professional fees 
loan servicing fees decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
these fees were incurred in connection with a loan servicing agreement between business loan and our adviser  which is based on the size and mix of the portfolio 
the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the size of our investment portfolio

the conversions were non cash transactions and were accounted for as repurchases of the shares previously received by the employees upon exercise of the stock options in exchange for the non recourse notes 
the repurchases were accounted for as treasury stock transactions at the fair value of the shares  totaling since the value of the stock option loans totaled  we recorded compensation expense of other operating expenses including professional fees  stockholder related costs  director s fees  insurance and other direct expenses increased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year  due primarily to legal fees incurred in connection with certain portfolio loans during the year ended september  and an increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables from portfolio companies

our control investments also experienced unrealized appreciation due to an increase in certain comparable multiples 
however  our non control investments experienced unrealized depreciation  which was due primarily to a reduction in certain comparable multiples and the performance of some of our portfolio companies used to estimate the fair value of our investments 
although our investment portfolio appreciated during the year ended september   our entire portfolio was fair valued at of cost as of september  the cumulative unrealized depreciation of our investments does not have an impact on our current ability to pay distributions to stockholders  however  it may be an indication of future realized losses  which could ultimately reduce our income available for distribution

base management fee decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year  which is reflective of fewer total assets held during the year ended september  furthermore  due to the liquidation of the majority of our syndicated loans  the credit received against the gross base management fee for investments in syndicated loans has also been reduced 
the base management fee is computed quarterly as described under investment advisory and management agreement in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and is summarized in the table below year ended september  september  base management fee credit for fees received by adviser from the portfolio companies fee reduction for the voluntary  irrevocable and unconditional waiver of fee on senior syndicated loans to net base management fee base management fee is net of loan servicing fees per the terms of the advisory agreement 
the board of our adviser voluntarily  irrevocably and unconditionally waived on a quarterly basis the annual base management fee to for senior syndicated loan participations for the years ended september  and fees waived cannot be recouped by the adviser in the future 
incentive fee decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
the board of our adviser voluntarily  irrevocably and unconditionally waived on a quarterly basis the entire incentive fee for each quarter of the years ended september  and the incentive fee and associated credits are summarized in the table below year ended september  september  incentive fee credit from voluntary  irrevocable and unconditional waiver issued by adviser s board of directors net incentive fee administration fee decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year  due to a decrease of administration staff and related expenses  as well as a decrease in our total assets in comparison to the total assets of all companies managed by our adviser under similar agreements 
the calculation of the administrative fee is described in detail under investment advisory and management agreement in note of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
interest expense decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year due primarily to decreased borrowings under our line of credit during the year ended september   partially offset by a higher weighted average annual interest cost  which is determined by using the annual stated interest rate plus commitment and other fees  plus the amortization of deferred financing fees dividend by the weighted average debt outstanding 
other operating expenses including deferred financing fees  stockholder related costs  directors fees  insurance and other expenses increased over the prior year driven by amortization of additional fees incurred with amending the db facility and our entry into a new credit facility and legal fees incurred in connection with troubled loans during the year ended september  realized loss and unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments realized losses the realized loss for the year ended september  consisted of a  loss from the sale of several syndicated loans and one non syndicated loan  a  write off of the badanco loan  and a write off of a portion of the greatwide second lien syndicated loan  partially offset by a gain from the country road payoff 
net realized loss on investments during the year ended september  resulted from the partial sale of the senior subordinated term loan of greatwide logistics  as well as the unamortized investment acquisition costs related to the anitox and macfadden loans  which were repaid in full during the year 
unrealized appreciation depreciation net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio during the year  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains and losses are realized 
the net unrealized appreciation depreciation for the years ended september  and were  and  respectively 
the primary drivers of our net unrealized appreciation for the year ended september  were the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on our exited investments  and the unrealized appreciation of our control investments  offset by unrealized depreciation of our non control investments 
our non control investments experienced unrealized depreciation  which was due primarily to a reduction in certain comparable multiples and the performance of some of our portfolio companies used to estimate the fair value of our investments 
for the year ended september   the unrealized depreciation resulted from the fair value decrease in our investments  most notably localtel  greatwide  us healthcare and visual edge 
we believe that our investment portfolio was valued at a depreciated value due primarily to the general instability of the loan markets and  to a lesser extent  the use of a modified valuation procedure for our non control non affiliate investments 
consistent with the board s ongoing review and analysis of appropriate valuation procedures  and in consideration of the fair value measurements of asc adopted on october   the board of directors modified our valuation procedure so that the debt portion of bundled investments in non controlled companies is based on opinions of value provided by standard poor s securities evaluations  inc spse 
this change in valuation estimate accounted for  or  of the net unrealized depreciation for the year ended september  although our investment portfolio had depreciation  our entire portfolio was fair valued at of cost as of september  the cumulative unrealized depreciation of our investments does not have an impact on our current ability to pay distributions to stockholders  however  it may be an indication of future realized losses  which could ultimately reduce our income available for distribution 
realized and unrealized loss gain on derivative for the year ended september   we recorded a realized loss the settlement of our derivative of  due to the expiration of our interest rate cap agreement in february in addition  we recorded net unrealized appreciation on derivative of  which resulted from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation when the loss was realized 
we did not receive any interest rate cap agreement payments during the period from october through february as a result of the one month libor having a downward trend 
during the year ended september   we received interest rate cap agreement payments of only as a result of the one month libor having a downward trend 
we received payments when the one month libor was over 
in addition  we recorded net unrealized depreciation of  due to a decrease in the fair market value of our interest rate cap agreement 
net unrealized appreciation on borrowings under line of credit unrealized appreciation on borrowings under line of credit is the net change in the fair value of our line of credit borrowings during the year  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains and losses are realized 
during the year ended september   we elected to apply asc  financial instruments  which requires that we apply a fair value methodology to the credit facility 
we estimated the fair value of the credit facility using estimates of value provided by an independent third party and our own assumptions in the absence of observable market data  including estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date 
the credit facility was fair valued at  as of september   and an unrealized appreciation of was recorded for the year ended september  net increase decrease in net assets from operations for the year ended september   we realized a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of  as a result of the factors discussed above

the following table summarizes the contractual principal repayment and maturity of our investment portfolio by fiscal year  assuming no voluntary prepayments 
fiscal year ending september  amount total contractual repayments investments in equity securities unamortized premiums  discounts and investment acquisition costs on debt securities total investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was  for the redemption of a us treasury bill with an original maturity of six months 
the us treasury bill was purchased in with proceeds from our initial stock purchase in our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone financial corporation previously known as gladstone ssbic corporation 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was  and mainly consisted of net payments on the credit facility of  distribution payments of  and financing fees of  associated with the credit facility  which was entered into on march  net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was  and mainly consisted of net payments on our line of credit of  distribution payments of  and financing fees of  associated with the credit facility which was entered into on may  net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was  and mainly consisted of net borrowings on our line of credit of  proceeds of  net of offering costs  from the issuance of common stock and distribution payments of distributions in order to qualify as a ric and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required  under subchapter m of the code  to distribute at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
in accordance with these requirements  we declared and paid monthly cash dividends of per common share for each month from october through march and per common share for each month from april through september we declared and paid monthly cash dividends of per common share during each month of the fiscal year ended september  for the year ended september   our distribution payments were approximately  we declared these distributions based on our estimates of net investment income for the fiscal year 
our investment pace was slower than expected and  consequently  our net investment income was lower than our original estimates 
a portion of the distributions declared during fiscal is expected to be treated as a return of capital to our stockholders 
section a disclosure our board of directors estimates the source of the distributions at the time of their declaration as required by section a of the act 
on a monthly basis  if required under section a  we post a section a notice through the depository trust company s legal notice system lens and also send to our registered stockholders a written section a notice along with the payment of dividends for any payment which includes a dividend estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income 
the estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on gaap that are subject to revision  and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year 
following the calendar year end  after definitive information has been determined by us  if we have made distributions of taxable income or return of capital  we will deliver a form div to our stockholders specifying such amount and the tax characterization of such amount 
therefore  these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of section a of the act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes 
the following gaap estimates were made by the board of directors during the quarter ended september  month ended ordinary income return of capital total dividend july  august  september  because our board of directors declares dividends at the beginning of a quarter  it is difficult to estimate how much of our monthly dividends and distributions  based on gaap  will come from ordinary income  capital gains and returns of capital 
subsequent to the quarter ended september   the following corrections were made to the above listed estimates for that quarter month ended ordinary income return of capital total dividend july  august  september  a positive number under return of capital indicates a return of capital was estimated whereas a negative number indicates that a surplus of income above the distribution was estimated 
tax information for the year ended september  we are providing this information as required by the internal revenue code 
the amounts shown may differ from those elsewhere in this report because of differences between tax and financial reporting requirements 
our distributions to stockholders included from long term capital gains  subject to the rate gains category 
for taxable non corporate stockholders  none of our income represents qualified dividend income subject to the rate category 
for corporatestockholders  none of our income qualifies for the dividends received deduction 
issuance of equity on october   we filed a registration statement on form n with the sec  which was declared effective on january  the registration statement permits us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities  consisting of common stock  senior common stock  preferred stock  subscription rights  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock  or a combination of these securities 
we anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future 
however  we cannot determine the terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us  or at all 
additionally  when our common stock is trading below nav  as it has consistently traded for most of the last months  we will have regulatory constraints under the act on our ability to obtain additional capital in this manner 
generally  the act provides that we may not issue and sell our common stock at a price below our nav per share  other than to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering  without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors 
as of september   our nav per share was and as of november  our closing market price was per share 
to the extent that our common stock trades at a market price below our nav per share  we will generally be precluded from raising equity capital through public offerings of our common stock  other than pursuant to stockholder approval or a rights offering 
the asset coverage requirement of a bdc under the act effectively limits our ratio of debt to equity to to the extent that we are unable to raise capital through the issuance of equity  our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt may also be inhibited to the extent of our regulatory debt to equity ratio limits 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on february   our stockholders approved a proposal that authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current nav per share for a period of one year  provided that our board of directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale 
we have not issued any common stock since february on may   we and our adviser entered into an equity distribution agreement the equity agreement with bb t capital markets  a division of scott stringfellow  llc the agent under which we may  from time to time  issue and sell through the agent up to  shares of our common stock the shares based upon instructions from us 
sales of shares through the agent  if any  will be executed by means of either ordinary brokers transactions on the nasdaq global select market or such other sales of the shares as shall be agreed by us and the agent 
the compensation payable to the agent for sales of shares with respect to which the agent acts as sales agent shall be equal to of the gross sales price of the shares for amounts of shares sold pursuant to the equity agreement 
to date  we have not issued any shares pursuant to the equity agreement 
revolving credit facility on march   we entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement which currently provides for a  revolving line of credit 
advances under the credit facility initially bore interest at the day libor subject to a minimum rate of  plus per annum  with a commitment fee of per annum on undrawn amounts 
however  on november the amendment date  we amended our credit facility such that advances bear interest at the day libor subject to a minimum rate of  plus per annum  with a commitment fee of per annum on undrawn amounts when the facility is drawn more than and per annum on undrawn amounts when the facility is drawn less than 
subject to certain terms and conditions  the credit facility may be expanded up to  through the addition of other committed lenders to the facility 
as of september   there was a cost basis of approximately  of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at an average interest rate of 
as of november   there was a cost basis of approximately  of borrowings outstanding 
we expect that the credit facility will allow us to increase the rate of our investment activity and grow the size of our investment portfolio 
available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed under the credit facility  based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by us 
interest is payable monthly during the term of the credit facility 
the credit facility matures on march   and  if the facility is not renewed or extended by this date  all unpaid principal and interest will be due and payable on march  in addition  if the credit facility is not renewed on or before march   we will be required to use all principal collections from our loans to pay outstanding principal on the credit facility 
in addition to the annual interest rate on borrowings outstanding  under the terms of the credit facility prior to the amendment date  we were obligated to pay an annual minimum earnings shortfall fee to the committed lenders on march   which was calculated as the difference between the weighted average of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and of the commitment amount of the credit facility  multiplied by per annum  less commitment fees paid during the year 
as of september   we had accrued approximately in minimum earnings shortfall fees 
however  as a result of the amendment to the credit facility  we are no longer obligated to pay an annual minimum earnings shortfall fee 
on the amendment date  we paid a fee 
the credit facility contains covenants that require business loan to maintain its status as a separate entity  prohibit certain significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies 
the facility requires a minimum of obligors in the borrowing base and also limits payments of distributions 
as of september   we had obligors and we were in compliance with all of the facility covenants 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had a commitment to purchase a  syndicated loan  which closed subsequent to september  in addition  we have certain lines of credit with our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn 
since these lines of credit have expiration dates and we expect many will never be fully drawn  the total line of credit commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we estimate the fair value of these unused lines of credit commitments as of september  and to be nominal 
in july  we executed a guaranty of a line of credit agreement between comerica bank and defiance integrated technologies  inc defiance  one of our control investments 
if defiance has a payment default  the guaranty is callable once the bank has reduced its claim by using commercially reasonable efforts to collect through disposition of the defiance collateral 
the guaranty is limited to plus interest on that amount accrued from the date demand payment is made under the guaranty  and all costs incurred by the bank in its collection efforts 
as of september   we had not been required to make any payments on the guaranty of the line of credit agreement and we consider the credit risk to be remote 
in accordance with gaap  the unused portions of the lines of credit commitments are not recorded on the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities 
the following table summarizes the nominal dollar balance of unused line of credit commitments and guarantees as of september  and as of september  unused lines of credit guarantees the following table shows our contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period less than contractual obligations year years years after years total line of credit excludes the unused commitments to extend credit to our portfolio companies of  as discussed above 
borrowings under the credit facility are listed  at fair value  based on the contractual maturity due to the revolving nature of the facility 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the years reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we have identified our investment valuation process  which was modified during the year ended september   as our most critical accounting policy 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
general valuation policy we value our investments in accordance with the requirements of the act 
as discussed more fully below  we value securities for which market quotations are readily available and reliable at their market value 
we value all other securities and assets at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
we adopted asc on october  in part  asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
asc provides a consistent definition of fair value that focuses on exit price in the principal  or most advantageous  market and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
asc also establishes the following three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs are in those markets for which there are few transactions  the prices are not current  little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers  and level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
unobservable inputs are those inputs that reflect our own assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability based upon the best available information 
see note  investments in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our adoption of asc we use generally accepted valuation techniques to value our portfolio unless we have specific information about the value of an investment to determine otherwise 
from time to time we may accept an appraisal of a business in which we hold securities 
these appraisals are expensive and occur infrequently but provide a third party valuation opinion that may differ in results  techniques and scopes used to value our investments 
when these specific third party appraisals are engaged or accepted  we would use estimates of value provided by such appraisals and our own assumptions including estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date to value the investment we have in that business 
in determining the value of our investments  our adviser has established an investment valuation policy the policy 
the policy has been approved by our board of directors  and each quarter our board of directors reviews whether our adviser has applied the policy consistently and votes whether or not to accept the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
the policy  which is summarized below  applies to the following categories of securities publicly traded securities  securities for which a limited market exists  and securities for which no market exists 
valuation methods publicly traded securities we determine the value of publicly traded securities based on the closing price for the security on the exchange or securities market on which it is listed and primarily traded on the valuation date 
to the extent that we own restricted securities that are not freely tradable  but for which a public market otherwise exists  we will use the market value of that security adjusted for any decrease in value resulting from the restrictive feature 
securities for which a limited market exists we value securities that are not traded on an established secondary securities market  but for which a limited market for the security exists  such as certain participations in  or assignments of  syndicated loans  at the quoted bid price 
in valuing these assets  we assess trading activity in an asset class  evaluate variances in prices and other market insights to determine if any available quote prices are reliable 
if we conclude that quotes based on active markets or trading activity may be relied upon  firm bid prices are requested  however  if a firm bid price is unavailable  we base the value of the security upon the indicative bid price offered by the respective originating syndication agent s trading desk  or secondary desk  on or near the valuation date 
to the extent that we use the indicative bid price as a basis for valuing the security  our adviser may take further steps to consider additional information to validate that price in accordance with the policy 
in the event these limited markets become illiquid such that market prices are no longer readily available  we will value our syndicated loans using estimated net present values of the future cash flows or discounted cash flows 
the use of a discounted cash flow dcf methodology follows that prescribed by asc  which provides guidance on the use of a reporting entity s own assumptions about future cash flows and risk adjusted discount rates when relevant observable inputs  such as quotes in active markets  are not available 
when relevant observable market data does not exist  the alternative outlined in asc is the use of valuing investments based on dcf 
for the purposes of using dcf to provide fair value estimates  we consider multiple inputs such as a risk adjusted discount rate that incorporates adjustments that market participants would make both for nonperformance and liquidity risks 
as such  we develop a modified discount rate approach that incorporates risk premiums including  among others  increased probability of default  or higher loss given default  or increased liquidity risk 
the dcf valuations applied to the syndicated loans provide an estimate of what we believe a market participant would pay to purchase a syndicated loan in an active market  thereby establishing a fair value 
we will continue to apply the dcf methodology in illiquid markets until quoted prices are available or are deemed reliable based on trading activity 
as of september   we assessed trading activity in syndicated loan assets and determined that there had been a return to market liquidity and a better functioning secondary market for these assets 
thus  firm bid prices or indicative bid prices were used to fair value our remaining syndicated loans at september  securities for which no market exists the valuation methodology for securities for which no market exists falls into three categories portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities  portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of securities  which can include debt and equity securities  and portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities 
portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities debt securities that are not publicly traded on an established securities market  or for which a limited market does not exist non public debt securities  and that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity or equity like securities  are fair valued in accordance with the terms of the policy  which utilizes opinions of value submitted to us by spse 
we may also submit pik interest to spse for their evaluation when it is determined that pik interest is likely to be received 
in the case of non public debt securities  we have engaged spse to submit opinions of value for our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies in which we own no equity  or equity like securities 
spse s opinions of value are based on the valuations prepared by our portfolio management team as described below 
we request that spse also evaluate and assign values to success fees conditional interest included in some loan securities when we determine that there is reasonable probability of receiving a success fee on a given loan 
spse will only evaluate the debt portion of our investments for which we specifically request evaluation  and may decline to make requested evaluations for any reason at its sole discretion 
upon completing our collection of data with respect to the investments which may include the information described below under credit information  the risk ratings of the loans described below under loan grading and risk rating and the factors described hereunder  this valuation data is forwarded to spse for review and analysis 
spse makes its independent assessment of the data that we have assembled and assesses its independent data to form an opinion as to what they consider to be the market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  spse has issued the following paragraph spse provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what spse believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects spse s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  spse cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimates thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  spse cannot guarantee their accuracy 
spse opinions of value of our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity or equity like securities are submitted to our board of directors along with our adviser s supplemental assessment and recommendation regarding valuation of each of these investments 
our adviser generally accepts the opinion of value given by spse  however  in certain limited circumstances  such as when our adviser may learn new information regarding an investment between the time of submission to spse and the date of the board assessment our adviser s conclusions as to value may differ from the opinion of value delivered by spse 
our board of directors then reviews whether our adviser has followed its established procedures for determinations of fair value  and votes to accept or reject the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
our adviser and our management recommended  and the board of directors voted to accept  the opinions of value delivered by spse on the loans in our portfolio as denoted on the schedule of investments included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
because there is a delay between when we close an investment and when the investment can be evaluated by spse  new loans are not valued immediately by spse  rather  management makes its own determination about the value of these investments in accordance with our valuation policy using the methods described herein 
portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities the fair value of these investments is determined based on the total enterprise value of the portfolio company  or issuer  utilizing a liquidity waterfall approach 
for non public debt securities and equity or equity like securities eg preferred equity  common equity  or other equity like securities that are purchased together as part of a package  where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security  both the debt and equity securities of the portfolio investment would exit in the mergers and acquisitions market as the principal market  generally through a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
in accordance with asc  we apply the in use premise of value which assumes the debt and equity securities are sold together 
under this liquidity waterfall approach  we continue to use the enterprise value methodology utilizing a liquidity waterfall approach to determine the fair value of these investments under asc if we have the ability to initiate a sale of a portfolio company as of the measurement date 
under this approach  we first calculate the total enterprise value of the issuer by incorporating some or all of the following factors the issuer s ability to make payments  the earnings of the issuer  recent sales to third parties of similar securities  the comparison to publicly traded securities  and discounted cash flow or other pertinent factors 
in gathering the sales to third parties of similar securities  we may reference industry statistics and use outside experts 
once we have estimated the total enterprise value of the issuer  we subtract the value of all the debt securities of the issuer  which are valued at the contractual principal balance 
fair values of these debt securities are discounted for any shortfall of total enterprise value over the total debt outstanding for the issuer 
once the values for all outstanding senior securities which include the debt securities have been subtracted from the total enterprise value of the issuer  the remaining amount  if any  is used to determine the value of the issuer s equity or equity like securities 
if  in our adviser s judgment  the liquidity waterfall approach does not accurately reflect the value of the debt component  our adviser may recommend that we use a valuation by spse or  if that is unavailable  a dcf valuation technique 
portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities we value non public debt securities that are purchased together with equity or equity like securities from the same portfolio company  or issuer  for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  using a hypothetical secondary market as our principal market 
in accordance with asc  we determine the fair value of these debt securities of non control investments assuming the sale of an individual debt security using the in exchange premise of value 
as such  we estimate the fair value of the debt component using estimates of value provided by spse and our own assumptions in the absence of observable market data  including synthetic credit ratings  estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date 
subsequent to june   for equity or equity like securities of investments for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  we estimate the fair value of the equity using the in exchange premise of value based on factors such as the overall value of the issuer  the relative fair value of other units of account including debt  or other relative value approaches 
consideration also is given to capital structure and other contractual obligations that may impact the fair value of the equity 
further  we may utilize comparable values of similar companies  recent investments and indices with similar structures and risk characteristics or our own assumptions in the absence of other observable market data and may also employ dcf valuation techniques 
portfolio investments comprised of non publicly traded non control equity securities of other funds we value any uninvested capital of the non control fund at par value and value any invested capital at the value provided by the non control fund 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security in an arms length transaction in the security s principal market 
valuation considerations from time to time  depending on certain circumstances  the adviser may use the following valuation considerations  including but not limited to the nature and realizable value of the collateral  the portfolio company s earnings and cash flows and its ability to make payments on its obligations  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  the comparison to publicly traded companies  and dcf and other relevant factors 
because such valuations  particularly valuations of private securities and private companies  are not susceptible to precise determination  may fluctuate over short periods of time  and may be based on estimates  our determinations of fair value may differ from the values that might have actually resulted had a readily available market for these securities been available 
credit information our adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
we and our adviser participate in the periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold control and affiliate investments and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements 
using these statements or comparable information and board discussions  our adviser calculates and evaluates the credit statistics 
loan grading and risk rating as part of our valuation procedures above  we risk rate all of our investments in debt securities 
for syndicated loans that have been rated by an nrsro as defined in rule a under the act  we use the nrsro s risk rating for such security 
for all other debt securities  we use a proprietary risk rating system 
our risk rating system uses a scale of to  with being the lowest probability of default 
this system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
for the debt securities for which we do not use a third party nrsro risk rating  we seek to have our risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations  such as those provided by an nrsro 
while we seek to mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that our risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as an nrsro for these securities 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because our system rates debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro  there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
we believe our risk rating would be significantly higher than a typical nrsro risk rating because the risk rating of the typical nrsro is designed for larger businesses 
however  our risk rating has been designed to risk rate the securities of smaller businesses that are not rated by a typical nrsro 
therefore  when we use our risk rating on larger business securities  the risk rating is higher than a typical nrsro rating 
the primary difference between our risk rating and the rating of a typical nrsro is that our risk rating uses more quantitative determinants and includes qualitative determinants that we believe are not used in the nrsro rating 
it is our understanding that most debt securities of medium sized companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on an nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  our scale begins with the designation as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a bbb from an nrsro  however  no assurance can be given that a on our scale is equal to a bbb on an nrsro scale 
company s first second system nrsro nrsro description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next ten years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set forth are for a ten year term debt security 
if a debt security is less than ten years  then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period  which may move the security higher on our risk rating scale 
the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
our policy is to stop accruing interest on an investment if we determine that interest is no longer collectible 
as of september   two non control non affiliate investments and four control investments were on non accrual 
as of september   one non control non affiliate investments and four control investments were on non accrual 
additionally  we do not risk rate our equity securities

 rating highest b b b b average b b ccc caa weighted average b b ccc caa lowest b d c tax status we intend to continue to qualify for treatment as a ric under subtitle a  chapter of subchapter m of the code 
as a ric  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we must meet certain source of income  asset diversification  and annual distribution requirements 
under the annual distribution requirement  we are required to distribute to stockholders at least of our investment company taxable income  as defined by the code 
we have a policy to pay out as distributions up to of that amount 
in an effort to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute during each calendar year  an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
revenue recognition interest income recognition interest income  adjusted for amortization of premiums and acquisition costs  the accretion of discounts and the amortization of amendment fees  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
generally  when a loan becomes days or more past due or if our qualitative assessment indicates that the debtor is unable to service its debt or other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
however  we remain contractually entitled to this interest 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid and  in management s judgment  are likely to remain current  or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
as of september   two non control non affiliate investments and four control investments were on non accrual with an aggregate cost basis of approximately  or of the cost basis of all investments in our portfolio 
as of september   one non control non affiliate investment and four control investments were on non accrual with an aggregate cost basis of approximately  or of the cost basis of all investments in our portfolio 
success fees are recorded upon receipt 
success fees are contractually due upon a change of control in a portfolio company and are recorded in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
paid in kind interest and original issue discount one loan in our portfolio contains a pik provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
we recorded pik income of  and for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we also transfer past due interest to the principal balance as stipulated in certain loan amendments with portfolio companies 
for the years ended september   and  we rolled over past due interest to the principal balance of   and  respectively 
in addition  we have four oid loans 
for the years ended september   and  we recorded oid income of  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a description and our application of recent accounting pronouncements 
our adoption of these recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands  unless otherwise indicated market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the prices of securities held by the us may decline in response to certain events  including those directly involving the companies whose securities are owned by us  conditions affecting the general economy  overall market changes  local  regional or global political  social or economic instability  and interest rate fluctuations 
the primary risk we believe we are exposed to is interest rate risk 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
we use a combination of debt and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
while we expect that ultimately approximately of the loans in our portfolio will be made at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates  currently substantially all of our investment portfolio is at variable rates 
as of september   our portfolio consisted of the following variable rates with a floor variable rates without a floor or ceiling fixed rate total all of our variable rate loans have rates associated with either the current libor or prime rate 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net increase in net assets resulting from operations  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
net increase decrease in net increase decrease in increase decrease in assets resulting basis point change interest income interest expense a from operations up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points a as of september   the libor was  since the credit facility interest rate was subject to a floor  there is no impact from a basis point increase or decrease 
although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
we may also experience risk associated with investing in securities of companies with foreign operations 
we currently do not anticipate investing in debt or equity of foreign companies  however  some potential portfolio companies may have operations located outside the united states 
these risks include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  imposition of foreign taxes  changes in exportation regulations and political and social instability
