item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general frontier operates refineries in cheyenne  wyoming and el dorado  kansas as previously discussed in part i  item of this form k 
we focus our marketing efforts in the rocky mountain and plains states regions of the united states 
we purchase crude oil to be refined and market refined petroleum products  including various grades of gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  asphalt and other by products 
results of operations to assist in understanding our operating results  please refer to the operating data at the end of this analysis which provides key operating information for our refineries 
refinery operating data is also included in our quarterly reports on form q and on our web site at http www 
frontieroil 
com 
we make our web site content available for informational purposes only 
it should not be relied upon for investment purposes  nor is it incorporated by reference in this form k 
overview our refineries have a total annual average crude oil capacity of approximately  bpd 
the four significant indicators of our profitability  which are reflected and defined in the operating data at the end of this analysis  are the gasoline crack spread  the diesel crack spread  the light heavy crude oil differential and the wti wts crude oil differential 
other significant factors that influence our financial results are refinery utilization  crude oil price trends  asphalt and by product margins and refinery operating expenses including natural gas and maintenance 
during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its inventory valuation method for crude oil  unfinished products and finished products to the last in  first out lifo method from the first in  first out fifo method as previously disclosed 
see change in accounting principle inventory in note in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we typically do not use derivative instruments to offset price risk on our base level of operating inventories 
see price risk management activities under item a for a discussion of our utilization of futures trading 
crude oil market fundamentals  changes in the macro economy and geopolitical considerations have caused crude oil prices to be highly volatile 
our decreased profitability for the year ended december  was due to the decline of certain profitability indicators  including the diesel crack spread and crude oil differentials 
the decline in crude oil differentials has been caused by several factors  including significant industry equipment investments over the last few years to process heavy sour crude oil and declining availability of these types of crudes 
we expect the us recession  which has reduced demand for gasoline and diesel  and less attractive crude oil differentials could continue to negatively impact our results 
the poor refined product market conditions have resulted in an excess of refining capacity in the us and worldwide 
this over capacity is likely to continue until demand for refined products increases or capacity is reduced 
our cheyenne refinery is more drastically impacted by these market conditions  and we are taking actions to improve the profitability at our cheyenne refinery 
these actions include a combination of cost reductions and projects aimed at energy efficiency  yield improvements and crude type flexibility 
at this time  we are unable to project when industry conditions will improve or what additional steps we may take in response 
we will continue to evaluate the need to impair any of our assets should market conditions continue to deteriorate 
compared with as adjusted  see note to consolidated financial statements overview of results we had a net loss for the year ended december   of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the same period in our operating loss of million for the year ended december  reflected a decrease of million from the million operating income for the comparable period in the decrease in our results to a net loss for the year ended december   when compared to our net income for  was due to the decline of the aforementioned profitability indicators during the year ended december   including the average diesel crack spread per barrel in compared to per barrel in  and the crude oil differentials 
the light heavy crude oil differential decreased from per barrel for the year ended december  to per barrel for the comparable period of the wti wts crude oil differential decreased from per barrel for the year ended december  to per barrel for the comparable period of our results did benefit slightly from a higher average gasoline crack spread during the year ended december  per barrel than in per barrel 
product yields and sales volumes were higher during the year ended december  because of a  bpd increase in capacity that resulted from the crude vacuum tower project and the major turnaround work completed at the el dorado refinery during the second quarter of in addition  during the first quarter of  we received the benefit  primarily at our el dorado refinery  from purchasing discounted wti crude oil versus a nymex wti benchmark price because of the excess supply of crude oil at cushing  oklahoma 
this crude benefit has moderated since march specific variances refined product revenues 
refined product revenues decreased billion  or  from billion to billion for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due to a decrease in average product sales prices lower per sales barrel partially offset by higher product sales volumes in  more bpd 
sales prices decreased primarily because of lower crude oil prices  and correspondingly lower refined product prices during compared to manufactured product yields 
manufactured product yields yields are the volumes of specific materials obtained through the distilling of crude oil and the operations of other refinery process units 
yields increased  bpd at the el dorado refinery as described above and decreased  bpd at the cheyenne refinery for the year ended december  compared to other revenues 
other revenues decreased million to a million loss for the year ended december  compared to a million gain for  the primary source of which was million in net realized and unrealized losses from derivative contracts to hedge in transit crude oil and excess inventories during the year ended december  compared to million in net realized and unrealized gains from derivative contracts to hedge in transit crude oil and excess inventories in see price risk management activities under item a and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our utilization of commodity derivative contracts 
we had gasoline sulfur credit sales of million in compared to million in and million of ethanol renewable identification number rin sales in compared to million in ethanol rins were created to assist in tracking the compliance with national epa regulations for blending of renewable fuels 
raw material  freight and other costs 
raw material  freight and other costs include crude oil and other raw materials used in the refining process  purchased products and blendstocks  freight costs for fob destination sales  as well as the impact of changes in inventory 
raw material  freight and other costs decreased by billion  or  during the year ended december   from billion in to billion in the decrease in raw material  freight and other costs was due to lower average crude oil prices and decreased purchased products  partially offset by increased overall crude oil charges and lower crude oil differentials during the year when compared to the average nymex wti priced on the new york mercantile exchange was per barrel for the year ended december  compared to per barrel for the year ended december  average crude oil charges were  bpd for the year ended december  compared to  bpd in the cheyenne refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  decreased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to lower average crude oil prices and lower purchased products costs  partially offset by lower light heavy crude oil differentials and decreased overall crude oil charges 
average crude oil charges of  bpd for the year ended december  were lower than the  bpd in because of the intentional reduction in charges during part of the year due to the low refined product margins 
the heavy crude oil utilization rate at the cheyenne refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge decreased to in the year ended december   from in because we chose to process more light crude oils due to the narrowing of the light heavy crude differential in and thus the economic benefit of heavy crude oil 
the light heavy crude oil differential for the cheyenne refinery averaged per barrel in the year ended december  compared to per barrel in the el dorado refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  decreased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to lower average crude oil prices  partially offset by increased overall crude oil charges and lower crude oil differentials 
average crude oil charges were  bpd for the year ended december   compared to  bpd in the increase in average crude oil charges was due to the  bpd increase in capacity that resulted from the crude vacuum tower project and the major turnaround work completed at the el dorado refinery in the second quarter of we realized a light heavy crude oil differential of per barrel during compared to per barrel in for the year ended december   the heavy crude oil utilization rate at our el dorado refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge was approximately  compared to in the wti wts crude oil differential decreased from an average of per barrel in the year ended december  to an average of per barrel in refinery operating expenses 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  include both the variable costs energy and utilities and the fixed costs salaries  taxes  maintenance costs and other of operating the refineries 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  decreased  to million in the year ended december  from million in the cheyenne refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the increased expenses for compared to included increased environmental costs million  primarily due to an accrual for a proposed epa penalty  increased salaries and benefits million  including million of increased bonus expense based on calculated fifo proforma income  see note change in accounting principle inventory in the notes to consolidated financial statements  increased electricity costs  and increased water costs 
these increases were partially offset by decreased maintenance costs million as maintenance costs included various unplanned tank  coker repairs and outages  decreased natural gas costs million due to decreased prices partially offset by higher volumes  and decreased consulting and legal expenses million 
the el dorado refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december   decreasing from million for the year ended december  natural gas costs decreased by million due to lower volumes and prices  partially offset by increased costs in several areas 
the primary areas of increased costs for the period compared to the period were increased salaries and benefits million  including million of increased bonus expense as previously discussed  increased electricity costs million  increased environmental costs million  higher turnaround amortization million and higher property taxes million 
selling and general expenses 
selling and general expenses  excluding depreciation  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits which included a million increase in bonus expense as previously discussed and an increase in deferred compensation expense of million 
depreciation  amortization and accretion 
depreciation  amortization and accretion increased million including million for the el dorado refinery and million for the cheyenne refinery  or  from million for the year ended december  to million in because of increased capital investments in our refineries  including the phase one completion of the gasoil hydrotreater revamp and the catalytic cracker reliability projects at the el dorado refinery placed into service in the fourth quarter of as well as the el dorado refinery s crude unit and vacuum tower expansion project placed into service in the second quarter of the cheyenne refinery s depreciation increased due to numerous projects placed into service in interest expense and other financing costs 
interest expense and other financing costs of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the increase in interest expense primarily related to million more interest expense on the senior notes issued in september 
other increases included million more of interest expense on income tax contingencies   more of debt discount and finance cost amortization expense due to the senior notes and  increased interest and facility fees on our revolving credit facility 
capitalized interest for the year ended december  was million compared to million in these negative variances were partially offset by million less interest expense on the utexam master crude oil purchase and sale contract utexam arrangement see leases and other commitments in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we utilized the utexam facility less during than during as we purchased less canadian crude oil 
average debt outstanding excluding amounts reflected as accounts payable under the utexam arrangement increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in interest and investment income 
interest and investment income decreased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due to million less interest income resulting from lower interest rates on invested cash  offset by investment gains of  in compared to investment losses of million in provision for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  was million on a pretax loss of million or compared to a million provision on pretax income of million or in as discussed in note change in accounting principle inventory in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we adopted the lifo inventory method for gaap purposes and retrospectively adjusted our previously reported financial statements 
for income tax reporting purposes  the effective date of utilizing the lifo inventory method is january   resulting in a book to tax basis difference in inventory 
utilizing the lifo method of accounting for inventory for both gaap and income taxes greatly contributed to the net operating loss  which we plan to carryback to and as provided for under the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of to offset previously reported taxable income which will result in estimated refunds of approximately million 
our estimated taxable loss also includes accelerated deductions resulting from filing for a change in accounting method for income taxes for certain expenditures which are capitalized and depreciated under gaap but which we will be allowed to deduct in the year incurred for income tax purposes 
the housing and economic recovery act of and the american recovery and investment act of also provided accelerated tax depreciation for our capital projects which were started after january  and which we placed into service in and this accelerated deduction allows an expense deduction of of such costs in the year the qualified projects are placed in service with the remaining costs depreciable under regular tax depreciation rules 
the energy policy act of added section c to the internal revenue code which provides an accelerated deduction for qualified capital costs incurred to expand an existing refinery 
this accelerated deduction allows an expense deduction of of such costs in the year the qualified projects are placed in service with the remaining costs depreciable under regular tax depreciation rules 
these accelerated deductions were major factors in our and taxable losses 
our and income tax provisions included the benefit from million and million  respectively  of kansas income tax credits for expansion projects at our el dorado refinery 
see income taxes in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our income taxes and detailed information on our deferred tax assets 
compared with as adjusted  see note to consolidated financial statements overview of results we had net income for the year ended december   of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the same period in our operating income of million for the year ended december  reflected a decrease of million from the million operating income for the comparable period in the average gasoline crack spread was significantly lower during per barrel than in per barrel  and the light heavy crude oil differentials also decreased 
the average diesel crack spread was higher during per barrel than in per barrel 
specific variances refined product revenues 
refined product revenues increased billion  or  from billion to billion for the year ended december  compared to this increase was due to an increase in average product sales prices higher per sales barrel partially offset by lower product sales volumes in  fewer bpd 
sales prices increased primarily because of higher average crude oil prices in compared to manufactured product yields 
manufactured product yields yields are the volumes of specific materials obtained through the distilling of crude oil and the operations of other refinery process units 
yields decreased  bpd at the el dorado refinery and increased  bpd at the cheyenne refinery for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in yields at the el dorado refinery was due to lower crude oil throughput from the planned major turnaround work on the crude unit  the coker and the reformer during march and april of other revenues 
other revenues increased million to a million gain for the year ended december  compared to an million loss for  the primary source of which was million in net realized and unrealized gains from derivative contracts to hedge in transit crude oil and excess inventories during the year ended december  compared to million in net realized and unrealized losses from derivative contracts to hedge in transit crude oil and excess inventories in see price risk management activities under item a and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our utilization of commodity derivative contracts 
we had gasoline sulfur credit sales of million in compared to million in and million of ethanol renewable identification number rin sales in none in raw material  freight and other costs 
raw material  freight and other costs include crude oil and other raw materials used in the refining process  purchased products and blendstocks  freight costs for fob destination sales  as well as the impact of changes in inventory 
raw material  freight and other costs increased by billion  or  during the year ended december   from billion in to billion in the increase in raw material  freight and other costs when compared to was due to higher average crude prices  increased purchased products  lower light heavy crude oil differentials and during  the company reduced certain inventory quantities resulting in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years compared to the cost of purchases which lowered costs by million  partially offset by decreased overall crude oil charges during the year ended december  compared to the average nymex wti priced on the new york mercantile exchange was per barrel for the year ended december  compared to per barrel for the year ended december  average crude oil charges were  bpd for the year ended december  compared to  bpd in the cheyenne refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher average crude oil prices  increased purchased products  and lower light heavy crude oil differentials 
average crude oil charges of  bpd for the year ended december  were higher than the  bpd in because of a spring turnaround  a temporary shutdown of the fccu in the third quarter of  and a december fire in the coker unit at the cheyenne refinery 
the heavy crude oil utilization rate at the cheyenne refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge increased to in the year ended december   from in the light heavy crude oil differential for the cheyenne refinery averaged per barrel in the year ended december  compared to per barrel in the el dorado refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher average crude oil prices  and lower light heavy differentials 
average crude oil charges were  bpd for the year ended december   compared to  bpd in the decrease in average crude oil charges was due to the planned major turnaround work on the crude unit  the coker and the reformer during march and april of we realized a light heavy crude oil differential of per barrel during compared to per barrel in for the year ended december   the heavy crude oil utilization rate at our el dorado refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge was approximately  compared to in the wti wts crude oil differential decreased from an average of per barrel in the year ended december  to an average of per barrel in refinery operating expenses 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  include both the variable costs energy and utilities and the fixed costs salaries  taxes  maintenance costs and other of operating the refineries 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the cheyenne refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the increased expenses and the compared to variances included increased additives and chemicals costs million due to both price and volume increases  higher turnaround amortization million due to amortization of costs of turnarounds  higher electricity costs million due to both price and volume increases  increased natural gas costs  due to increased prices partially offset by lower volumes  higher property and other taxes  due to refinery additions  demurrage  and training 
these increases were partially offset by decreased maintenance costs million as maintenance costs included million of costs relating to repairs from the december coker unit fire  and decreased environmental costs 
the el dorado refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december   increasing from million for the year ended december  the primary areas of increased costs and the variance amounts for the period compared to the period were increased maintenance costs million  primarily related to demolition  catalyst and repair costs incurred during the march turnaround  increased salaries and benefits expenses million  mostly due to increased overtime in relation to the march turnaround  higher electricity costs million  increased operating supplies costs  and higher turnaround amortization 
these increases were partially offset by decreased environmental costs of million because included million in environmental penalties and there were no penalties in selling and general expenses 
selling and general expenses  excluding depreciation  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the million recognition of the loss on the beverly hills settlement during the year ended december  in addition  salaries and benefits expense including stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  decreased million compared to the same period in see stock based compensation under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million in depreciation  amortization and accretion 
depreciation  amortization and accretion increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million in because of increased capital investments in our refineries  including our el dorado refinery crude unit and vacuum tower expansion project placed into service in the second quarter of net gains on sales of assets 
the  gain on the sale of assets during the year ended december  compares to a million gain on sale of assets in the gain resulted from a gain of million from the sale of our interest in a crude oil pipeline in wyoming and a interest in two crude oil tanks in guernsey  wyoming in september  partially offset by the buyout and sale of a leased aircraft 
interest expense and other financing costs 
interest expense and other financing costs of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the increase in interest expense related to interest of million on the new senior notes offering   higher interest expense on the utexam master crude oil purchase and sale contract utexam arrangement see leases and other commitments in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and  increased interest and facility fees on our revolving credit facility 
capitalized interest for the year ended december  was million compared to million in these increased expenses were partially offset by a million reversal of interest expense for income tax contingency interest accruals due to the statute of limitations expiring 
average debt outstanding excluding amounts payable under the utexam arrangement increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in interest and investment income 
interest and investment income decreased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due to lower cash balances during the first eight months prior to receiving the proceeds from our senior notes offering of and lower interest rates on invested cash 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or compared to million on pretax income of million or in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the effective tax rate in the comparable period in primarily from recognizing the benefit from million of kansas income tax credits for expansion projects at our el dorado refinery which reduced the effective tax rate net of federal tax impact by approximately 
the american jobs creation act of the act created internal revenue code section section  which provides an income tax benefit to domestic manufacturers 
we recorded income tax benefits under section of approximately million and million  in our and income tax provisions  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was increased by approximately due to reversing previously recognized and production activities deductions from filing an amended return in and the planned carryback of the taxable loss 
the company did not recognize a benefit from the production activities deduction in  as it had a taxable loss 
the act also benefited our current income taxes payable by allowing us an accelerated depreciation deduction of of qualified capital costs incurred to achieve low sulfur diesel fuel requirements see environmental under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the act also provided for a per gallon federal income tax credit on compliant diesel fuel up to an amount equal to the remaining of these qualified capital costs 
the per gallon federal income tax credit allowed us to realize an million federal income tax credit million excess tax benefit and a million federal income tax credit million excess tax benefit in the years ended december  and  respectively 
this credit reduced our and income taxes payable and reduced our overall effective income tax rate for those years 
the energy policy act of added section c to the internal revenue code which provides an accelerated deduction for qualified capital costs incurred to expand an existing refinery 
this accelerated deduction allows an expense deduction of of such costs in the year the qualified projects are placed in service with the remaining costs depreciable under regular tax depreciation rules 
this section c deduction has benefited our cash flow for income taxes by reducing our taxable income for and and is a primary factor in our taxable loss 
see income taxes in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our income taxes and detailed information on our deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during the year ended december  working capital changes provided a total of million in and used million of cash in the most significant working capital item providing cash during the year ended december  was an increase in trade and crude payables of million 
the increase in trade and crude payables was primarily due to higher average prices of both crude oil and refined products at december  compared to december  working capital uses of cash during the year ended december  included an increase trade and other receivables of million and an increase in inventory of million 
the increase in inventory was mainly due to increased volumes at december  compared to december  million more barrels due to increased pipeline line fill commitments 
the increase in trade  note and other receivables primarily resulted from an estimated income tax receivable of million as of december  compared to million as of december  we made estimated federal and state income tax payments of million and  respectively  during the year ended december  as of december   we had estimated receivables for federal income taxes of million and state income taxes of million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  working capital of million and million available for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our operating cash flows are affected by crude oil and refined product prices and other risks as discussed in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
cash flows used in investing activities 
capital expenditures during the year ended december  were million  which included approximately million for the el dorado refinery and million for the cheyenne refinery 
the million of capital expenditures for our el dorado refinery included million on the gasoil hydrotreater revamp  million on the catalytic cracker regenerator emission control project  million for the catalytic cracker reliability project and million for the catalytic cracker electrical infrastructure  as well as operational  payout  safety  administrative  environmental and optimization projects 
the catalytic cracker reliability project cost million and was completed in the fourth quarter of the catalytic cracker regenerator emission control project  with a fourth quarter completion date and total cost of million  added a scrubber to improve the environmental performance of the unit  specifically as it relates to flue gas emissions 
this project is necessary to meet various epa requirements see environmental in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the million of capital expenditures for our cheyenne refinery included approximately million on the new cheyenne refinery office and control buildings  million for the cat gas hydrotreater project  million on the groundwater boundary wall control system and million for the waste water treatment plant flotation system  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
we funded our capital expenditures with cash generated from our operations and from available cash 
cash flows from financing activities 
during the year ended december   we paid million in dividends 
treasury stock also increased by  shares million from stock surrendered by employees to pay minimum withholding taxes on stock based compensation which vested during as of december   we had million of long term debt  of which million is due in  and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility as of december  we had shareholders equity of million as of december  our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of per share in november  and february  april  september  and november  which were paid in january  april  july and october and january  respectively 
the total cash required for the dividend declared in november was approximately million and was accrued as a dividend payable at year end 
accrued dividends are included in the line item accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets and includes dividends accrued to date on restricted stock  which are not paid until the restricted stock vests 
based on current market conditions and after giving effect to the change in inventory valuation method see change in accounting principle inventory in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company will be contractually unable to pay cash dividends under the restricted payments provision of the company s senior notes indentures for an undefined period of time 
future capital expenditures significant future capital projects 
the gasoil hydrotreater revamp at the el dorado refinery is the key project to achieve gasoline sulfur compliance for our el dorado refinery and has a total estimated cost of million million incurred as of december  see environmental in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the project will also result in a significant yield improvement for the catalytic cracking unit  and the first phase was completed in the fourth quarter of with the second phase anticipated to be completed mid as of december   outstanding non cancelable purchase commitments for the gasoil hydrotreater revamp were million 
at the cheyenne refinery  we plan to comply with the low sulfur gasoline requirements with the completion of the cat gasoline hydrotreater project see environmental in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this project is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of at an estimated total cost of million million incurred as of december  
as of december   outstanding non cancelable purchase commitments for the cat gasoline hydrotreater project were million 
in addition at the cheyenne refinery  we are working on a liquefied petroleum gas lpg recovery project that will recover significant quantities of saleable propane and butane and other lpg s for alkylation unit feed from the refinery fuel gas system 
the total estimated cost of this project is million  and at december   there were no material outstanding non cancellable purchase commitments related to this project 
this project is estimated to be completed by mid the above amounts include estimated capitalized interest 
capital expenditures 
including the projects discussed above  capital expenditures aggregating approximately million are currently planned  and include million at our cheyenne refinery  million at our el dorado refinery  million for our pipeline and product terminals and blending facility and  at our denver and houston offices 
the million of planned capital expenditures for our cheyenne refinery includes million for the cat gasoline hydrotreater project and million for the lpg recovery project  both mentioned above  as well as environmental  operational  safety  payout and administrative projects 
the million of planned capital expenditures for our el dorado refinery includes million for the gasoil hydrotreater revamp project  as mentioned above  as well as environmental  operational  safety  payout and administrative projects 
we expect that our capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by our operations and or by using a portion of our existing cash balance or additional borrowings  if necessary 
we will continue to review our capital expenditures in light of market conditions 
we may experience cost overruns and or schedule delays or adjust the scope on any of these projects 
contractual cash obligations the table below lists the contractual cash obligations we have by period 
these items include our long term debt based on their maturity dates  our operating lease commitments  our capital leases  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities 
our operating leases include building  equipment  aircraft and vehicle leases  which expire from through  as well as an operating sublease for the use of the cogeneration facility at our el dorado refinery 
the non cancelable sublease  entered into in connection with the acquisition of our el dorado refinery in  expires in with an option that allows us to renew the sublease for an additional eight years 
this lease has both a fixed and a variable component 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
the amounts shown below for transportation  terminalling and storage contractual obligations include our anticipated commitments based on our agreements for shipping crude oil on the express pipeline  the spearhead pipeline  the plains all american pipeline and the osage pipeline 
for more information on the agreements discussed above  see lease and other commitments in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period contractual cash obligations total within year within years within years after years in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases capital leases purchase obligations crude supply  feedstocks and natural gas transportation  terminalling and storage refinery capital projects other goods and services total purchase obligations contingent income tax liabilities other long term liabilities post retirement healthcare estimated future benefit payments total contractual cash crude supply  feedstocks and natural gas future obligations were calculated using current market prices and or prices established in applicable contracts 
of these obligations  million relate to january and february feedstock and natural gas requirements of the refineries 
contingent income tax liabilities of million are not included in the table because the timing and certainty cannot be reasonably estimated 
our post retirement health care plan is unfunded 
future payments for retiree health care benefits are estimated for the next ten years in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an interest in one unconsolidated entity see note nature of operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other than facility and equipment leasing agreements  we do not participate in any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements which would result in any off balance sheet liabilities or other arrangements to us 
environmental we will be making significant future capital expenditures to comply with various environmental regulations 
see environmental in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following summary provides information about our critical accounting policies  including identification of those involving critical accounting estimates  and should be read in conjunction with note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
turnarounds 
normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
planned major maintenance turnarounds is the scheduled and required shutdown of refinery processing units for significant overhaul and refurbishment 
turnaround costs include contract services  materials and rental equipment 
the costs of turnarounds are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs 
these deferred charges are included in our consolidated balance sheets in deferred turnaround costs 
also included in our consolidated balance sheets in deferred catalyst costs are the costs of the catalyst that is replaced at periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed function 
the catalyst costs are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the specific catalyst 
the amortization expenses for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs are included in refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation in our consolidated statements of operations 
since these policies rely on our estimated timing for the next turnaround and the useful lives of the catalyst  adjustments can occur in the amortization expenses as these estimates change 
inventories 
during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its inventory valuation method for crude oil  unfinished products and finished products to the lifo method from the fifo method as previously disclosed 
see change in accounting principle inventory in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inventories of crude oil  unfinished products and all finished products are recorded at the lower of cost on a lifo basis or market 
crude oil includes both domestic and foreign crude oil volumes at its cost and associated freight and other cost 
unfinished products work in process include any crude oil that has entered into the refining process  and other feedstocks that are not finished as far as refining operations are concerned 
these include unfinished gasoline and diesel  blendstocks and other feedstocks 
finished product inventory includes saleable gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  chemicals  asphalt and other finished products 
unfinished and finished products inventory values have components of raw material  the associated raw material freight and other costs  and direct refinery operating expense allocated when refining begins relative to their proportionate market values 
asset retirement obligations 
gaap requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred  with the associated asset retirement costs being capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
gaap also includes disclosure requirements that provide a description of asset retirement obligations and reconciliation of changes in the components of those obligations 
the gaap guidance clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in the current language refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the reporting entity 
since the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional  the guidance provides that a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset obligation should be recognized if that fair value can be reasonably estimated  even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
the guidance also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under gaap 
at december   our asset retirement obligation was million 
asset retirement obligations are affected by regulatory changes and refinery operations as well as changes in pricing of services 
in order to determine fair value  management must make certain estimates and assumptions  including  among other things  projected cash flows  a credit adjusted risk free interest rate  and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
these estimates and assumptions are subjective and are currently based on historical costs with adjustments for estimated future changes in the associated costs 
therefore  we expect the dollar amount of these obligations to change as more information is obtained 
a change in pricing of services would cause an approximate  change to the asset retirement obligation 
we believe that we adequately accrued for our asset retirement obligations as of december  and that changes in estimates in future periods will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see significant accounting policies in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information about asset retirement obligations 
environmental expenditures 
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized based upon their future economic benefit 
costs that improve a property s pre existing condition  and costs that prevent future environmental contamination  are capitalized 
remediation costs related to environmental damage resulting from operating activities subsequent to acquisition are expensed 
liabilities for these expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
such estimates are subject to change due to many factors  including the identification of new sites requiring remediation  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation  additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts  and potential improvements in remediation technologies 
post retirement benefit obligations 
we have significant post retirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and health care inflation rates 
changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control 
these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
see note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about these plans and the current assumptions used 
income taxes 
in accordance with gaap  we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments  which requires numerous judgments and assumptions 
we record contingent income tax liabilities  interest and penalties  based on our estimate as to whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due

market risks see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements under price and interest risk management activities for a discussion of our various price risk management activities 
when we make the decision to manage our price exposure  our objective is generally to avoid losses from negative price changes  realizing we will not obtain the benefit of positive price changes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changing energy prices 
our earnings and cash flows  as well as estimates of future cash flows  are sensitive to changes in energy prices 
the prices of crude oil and refined products have fluctuated substantially in recent years 
these prices depend on many factors  including the overall demand for crude oil and refined products  which in turn depend on  among other factors  general economic conditions  the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products  the availability of imports of crude oil and refined products  the marketing of alternative and competing fuels  the extent of government regulations and global market dynamics 
the prices we receive for refined products are also affected by factors such as local market conditions and the level of operations of other refineries in our markets 
the prices at which we can sell gasoline and other refined products are strongly influenced by the price of crude oil 
generally  an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil results in a corresponding increase or decrease in the price of gasoline and other refined products 
the timing of the relative movement of the prices  however  can impact profit margins  which could significantly affect our earnings and cash flows 
price risk management activities 
at times  we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions  purchases of foreign crude oil and consumption of natural gas in the refining process or to fix margins on certain future production 
the commodity derivative contracts used by us may take the form of futures contracts  collars or price swaps 
we believe that there is minimal credit risk with respect to its counterparties 
we account for our commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting under gaap  under mark to market accounting and gains and losses on transactions are reflected in other revenues on the consolidated statements of operations for each period 
when the derivative contracts are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes  the gains or losses are recognized in the related inventory in inventory of crude oil  products and other on the consolidated balance sheets and ultimately  when the inventory is charged or sold  in raw material  freight and other costs on the consolidated statements of operations 
see price risk management activities under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our outstanding derivative sale contracts and net unrealized losses as of december  are summarized below commodity period volume thousands of bbls expected close out date unrealized net loss in thousands crude oil february january crude oil march february interest rate risk 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear a current market rate of interest 
a one percent increase or decrease in the interest rates on our revolving credit facility would not significantly affect our earnings or cash flows 
our million principal senior notes due and million senior notes due that were outstanding at december  have fixed interest rates 
however  in october  due to current advantageous market conditions  the company entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps of million to reduce exposure related to our senior notes 
these interest rate swaps expose that portion of our long term debt to cash flow risk from interest rate changes 
our long term debt is also exposed to fair value risk 
the estimated fair value of our senior notes was million and our senior notes was million at december  operating data the following tables set forth the refining operating statistical information on a consolidated basis and for each refinery for  and the statistical information includes the following terms nymex wti the benchmark west texas intermediate crude oil priced on the new york mercantile exchange
