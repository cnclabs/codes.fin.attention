item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto included under item of this annual report 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements relating to our future results 
such forward looking statements are identified by use of forward looking words such as anticipates  believes  plans  estimates  expects  and intends or words or phrases of similar expression 
these forward looking statements are subject to management decisions and various assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the effects of terrorist attacks or conflicts or wars involving the united states or its allies or trading partners  the effects of labor strikes  weather conditions that may affect sales  volatility in fuel  utility  transportation and security costs  changes in global or regional political or economic conditions  including changes in governmental and central bank policies  changes in business conditions in the furniture industry  including changes in consumer spending patterns and demand for home furnishings  effects of our brand awareness and marketing programs  including changes in demand for our existing and new products  our ability to locate new design center sites and or negotiate favorable lease terms for additional design centers or for the expansion of existing design centers  competitive factors  including changes in products or marketing efforts of others  pricing pressures  fluctuations in interest rates and the cost  availability and quality of raw materials  those matters discussed in items a and a of this annual report and in our sec filings  and our future decisions 
accordingly  actual circumstances and results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles that require  in some cases  that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
estimates are based on currently known facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
actual results could differ from these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and these differences could be material 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments  affect our consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write downs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists eg a wholesale purchase order or retail sales invoice  the sales arrangement specifies a fixed or determinable sales price  product is shipped or services are provided to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
as such  revenue recognition occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent retailers or  in the case of ethan allen operated retail design centers  upon delivery to the customer 
recorded sales provide for estimated returns and allowances 
we permit our customers to return defective products and incorrect shipments  and terms we offer are standard for the industry 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
retail design center acquisitions we account for the acquisition of retail design centers and related assets with the purchase method 
accounting for these transactions as purchase business combinations requires the allocation of purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the amount paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived and indefinite lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company determines whether the carrying value exceeds the fair value as described below 
the recoverability of long lived assets are evaluated for impairment by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may exceed its fair value 
we conduct our required annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
to evaluate goodwill  the company determines the current fair value of the reporting units using a combination of market and income approaches 
in the market approach  the guideline company method is used  which focuses on comparing the company s risk profile and growth prospects to reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
key assumptions used for the guideline company method are total invested capital tic multiples for revenues and operating cash flows  as well as consideration of control premiums 
the tic multiples are determined based on public furniture companies within our peer group  and if appropriate  recent comparable transactions are also considered 
control premiums are determined using recent comparable transactions in the open market 
under the income approach  a discounted cash flow method is used  which includes a terminal value  and is based on external analyst financial projection estimates  as well as internal financial projection estimates prepared by management 
the long term terminal growth rate assumptions reflect our current long term view of the market in which we compete 
discount rates use the weighted average cost of capital for companies within our peer group  adjusted for specific company risk premium factors 
the fair value of our trade name  which is the company s only indefinite lived intangible asset other than goodwill  is valued using the relief from royalty method 
significant factors used in trade name valuation are rates for royalties  future growth  and a discount factor 
royalty rates are determined using an average of recent comparable values 
future growth rates are based on the company s perception of the long term values in the market in which we compete  and the discount rate is determined using the weighted average cost of capital for companies within our peer group  adjusted for specific company risk premium factors 
the economic downturn that began in the fall of negatively impacted the company s revenues and operating margins 
in response  the company reduced headcount  consolidated its manufacturing  retail  and 
table of contents logistics footprint and repositioned its marketing approach 
the company s cash flow forecasts were updated regularly to reflect the rapid changes in the business and the industry 
the cash flow projections used in its fair value evaluations are the best estimates of the company and require significant management judgment 
during fiscal  the company determined that million of goodwill in the retail segment was considered impaired and fully written off 
the company performed its annual impairment test in fiscal and determined that no impairment of its remaining goodwill  reported in its wholesale segment was appropriate as the fair value of its net assets exceeded the book value by approximately 
during fiscal  the company concluded that no interim impairment test of its indefinite lived assets was required 
net sales  gross profit  operating income  net income  written orders  and other indicators improved from previous quarters  and though some financial metrics were below management forecasts  our long term outlook had not changed significantly 
the company s average quarterly stock price increased from for the quarter ended june   to for the quarter ended march   and cash including restricted cash and marketable securities increased to million at march  from million at june  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  business performance improved with net sales up sequentially and from the previous year  gross margin improved and cash including restricted cash and marketable securities increased to million by fiscal year end 
the average price of our stock during the fourth fiscal quarter of was 
in the fourth fiscal quarter ended june   the company performed its annual impairment test and determined that the fair values of the wholesale reporting unit and trade name exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin 
to calculate fair value of the assets described above  management relies on estimates and assumptions which by their nature have varying degrees of uncertainty 
wherever possible  management therefore looks for third party transactions as described above to provide the best possible support for the assumptions incorporated 
management considers several factors to be significant when estimating fair value including expected financial outlook of the business  changes in the company s stock price  the impact of changing market conditions on financial performance and expected future cash flows  and other factors 
deterioration in any of these factors may result in a lower fair value assessment  which could lead to impairment of the long lived assets and goodwill of the company 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
additional factors that we consider when making judgments about the deferred tax valuation include tax law changes  a recent history of cumulative losses  and variances in future projected profitability 
the company evaluates quarterly uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns for recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure in its financial statements 
if an income tax position exceeds a probability of success upon tax audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  the company recognizes an income tax benefit in its financial statements 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a long term liability except for the amount for which a cash payment is expected to be made or tax positions settled within one year 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
business insurance reserves we have insurance programs in place to cover workers compensation and property casualty claims 
the insurance programs  which are funded through self insured retention  are subject 
table of contents to various stop loss limitations 
we accrue estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience 
although we believe that the insurance reserves are adequate  the reserve estimates are based on historical experience  which may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
we adjust insurance reserves  as needed  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
other loss reserves we have a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  tax liabilities  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with our counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on our current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
basis of presentation as of june   ethan allen interiors inc has no material assets other than its ownership of the capital stock of ethan allen global  inc and conducts all significant transactions through ethan allen global  inc  therefore  substantially all of the financial information presented herein is that of ethan allen global  inc results of operations our business has been severely impacted by the economic factors in the united states and abroad which we began to feel in earnest during our second quarter of fiscal high unemployment  volatile capital markets  depressed housing prices and tight consumer spending all put negative stress on the economy and continue to have a negative impact on our business 
as we work through these difficult times  we have taken dramatic actions to significantly reduce costs in all facets of our business including closing and realigning manufacturing plants  consolidating logistics operations  and closing under performing retail design centers 
these actions have been taken with appropriate consideration for demand and management believes it has retained sufficient scalable capacity 
we have also launched initiatives to increase sales  such as special savings product promotions  our designer affiliate program  and completed the conversion of our case goods products to custom this fiscal year 
income tax valuation allowance as a result of losses we sustained for fiscal and  which were brought on by the severe economic factors discussed earlier  we reassessed the likelihood that we would be able to realize the benefits of our deferred federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets 
as a result  we recorded a million valuation allowance against those assets  with a non cash charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring activities in recent years  we have announced and executed plans to consolidate our operations as part of an overall strategy to maximize production efficiencies and maintain our competitive advantage 
activity in the company s restructuring reserves is classified with accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets in fiscal  the company announced i upholstery plants in eldred  pennsylvania and chino  california were consolidated into the maiden  north carolina and silao  mexico operations  ii closure of the andover  maine sawmill  iii the move of assembly and finishing operations from beecher falls  vermont to orleans  vermont  and iv wholesale distribution and retail service centers were consolidated 
we also began the conversion of our 
table of contents domestic case goods manufacturing from producing to a forecast to producing to fill custom orders already written 
the total pre tax restructuring  impairment  accelerated depreciation and other related charges for these fiscal actions was million million in the wholesale segment and million in the retail segment 
the charges arose from i a million impact on long lived assets  ii million in employee severance  compensation  and benefit costs  and iii million in other associated costs 
current fiscal year charges for these actions include million in accelerated depreciation charges for wholesale included in cost of sales in the statement of operations partially offset by million of restructuring credits  and million of restructuring charges for the retail segment primarily due to adjustments on non cancellable leases 
these restructuring actions announced in fiscal were completed during fiscal  with the remaining liability at june  primarily for non cancellable lease obligations expirations of less than one year up to five years 
in fiscal  we announced a plan to consolidate the operations of certain ethan allen operated retail design centers and retail service centers 
in connection with this initiative  we permanently ceased operations at ten design centers and six retail service centers which  for the most part  were consolidated into other existing operations 
the restructuring is now complete  with the remaining liability at june  primarily for non cancellable lease obligations expirations of less than one year up to years and other employee benefit costs 
costs for these actions in the current fiscal year resulted in a net million credit in the retail segment due primarily to non cancellable lease adjustments 
cumulative charges to date for these actions total million 
all charges for the fiscal and restructuring activities above are included as restructuring and impairment charges in the statement of operations unless otherwise noted above 
business results our revenues are comprised of i wholesale sales to independently operated and company operated retail design centers and ii retail sales of company operated design centers 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  included under item of this annual report 
the components of consolidated revenues and operating income loss are as follows in millions fiscal year ended june  revenue wholesale segment retail segment elimination of inter segment sales consolidated revenue operating income loss wholesale segment retail segment adjustment for inter company profit consolidated operating income operating income for the wholesale segment for the twelve months ended june and includes pre tax restructuring and impairment charges credit of million and million  respectively

represents the change in wholesale profit contained in ethan allen operated design center inventory existing at the end of the period 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal net sales for the period largely reflect the delivery of product associated with booked orders and the change in backlog from the beginning to the end of the period 
especially in the first half of fiscal  sales continued to be affected by the negative economic stresses mentioned earlier which we experienced since the second quarter of fiscal these factors were partially offset by i several new marketing initiatives that focus on the exceptional value proposition of our offerings through special savings promotions and our interactive web site ethanalleninc 
com  ii the continued use of national television media supported by direct mail and electronic magazines  and iii the positive effects of efforts to reposition the retail network 
these efforts resulted in a increase in incoming retail orders during the second half of fiscal wholesale revenue for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the year over year decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in the incoming order rate during the first half of fiscal as a result of the continued soft retail environment for home furnishings 
this was partly offset by an increase in the incoming order rate during the second half of fiscal  and from an increase in independent retail design centers to from including one location transferred in to the company s retail division during the year 
wholesale orders increased during the second half of fiscal compared to the second half of fiscal  after decreasing during the first half of fiscal compared to the first half of fiscal retail revenue from ethan allen operated design centers for the twelve months ended june  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the twelve months ended june  the decrease in retail sales by ethan allen operated design centers was attributable to a decrease in comparable design center delivered sales of million  or during the first half of the fiscal year 
this unfavorable variance was partially offset during the second half of the fiscal year by a million  or increase in comparable design center delivered sales compared to prior year 
newly opened including relocated or acquired design centers contributed sales of million 
the number of ethan allen operated design centers decreased to at june  from at june  during that twelve month period  we acquired one design center from an independent retailer  and opened four new design centers of which three were relocations 
comparable design centers are those that have been operating for at least months 
minimal net sales  derived from the delivery of customer ordered product  are generated during the first three months of operations of newly opened including relocated design centers 
design centers acquired by us from independent retailers are included in comparable design center sales in their th full month of ethan allen operated operations 
year over year  written business of ethan allen operated design centers increased for the year  and comparable design center written business increased  reflecting to some degree the benefit of our retail consolidation strategy to serve given markets with fewer design centers but to improve the use of technology and design support 
while written business continues to reflect the soft retail environment for home furnishings noted throughout the current year  retail written orders during the second half of fiscal have increased from the prior year  having decreased from the prior year during the first half 
we believe that over time  we will benefit from our i repositioning the retail network  ii new product introductions including custom case good products  iii several new marketing initiatives described previously  and iv our continued use of national television and shelter magazines as advertising media supported by direct mail and electronic magazines 
gross profit for fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal the million decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to a combined decline in both wholesale and retail sales of  along with a shift in sales mix with retail sales representing a lower proportionate share of total sales in the current full year as compared to the prior full year 
gross margin decreased partially due to million of accelerated depreciation recorded in fiscal related to restructuring actions  temporary manufacturing disruptions caused by restructuring activities  and the conversion of our domestic case goods to 
table of contents custom manufacturing 
because of the consolidation of several wholesale distribution  upholstery and case good plants  we were able to increase absorption of overhead costs despite the sales decline  and to operate at approximately of capacity during fiscal  up from one year prior 
the consolidated gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal as a result  primarily  of the factors set forth above 
operating expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal decreases were experienced due to a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in the march quarter that did not recur in the current fiscal year and a million year over year decrease in restructuring and impairment charges  both discussed earlier 
there was also a million reduction in commission charges due to changes in the commission plans occurring in both years 
cost cutting efforts taken by the company also reduced salaries  benefits and occupancy costs 
advertising expenses were reduced while still maintaining our national presence  and delivery and warehousing costs were lower due to decreased sales 
consolidated operating loss for the year ended june  totaled a loss of million  or of net sales  compared to a loss of million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the improvement of million was largely attributable to i the one time nature of the march million goodwill impairment charge  ii decreased restructuring and impairment charges and iii net declines in other operating expenses  all of which were discussed previously and partially offset by the decline in gross profit due in part by the million accelerated depreciation recorded in the first quarter of fiscal wholesale operating income for fiscal totaled million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to i a million decrease in restructuring and impairment charges due to the restructuring actions discussed earlier  partly offset by the million in accelerated depreciation taken during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of those same restructuring activities 
retail operating loss was million  or of sales  for fiscal  compared to a loss of million  or of sales  for fiscal  an improvement of million 
the primary reasons for the improvement was the million goodwill impairment charge in march  net impact of commission changes in both years  and the positive effects of cost cutting efforts taken by the company 
interest and other income  net totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million increase was mostly due to miscellaneous non operating fees  partly offset by reduced investment income resulting from with lower rates of interest during the current year 
interest and other related financing costs remained largely unchanged at million from million in the prior year 
this amount mostly consists of interest expense on our senior unsecured debt issued in september income tax expense was million for fiscal as compared to a benefit of million for fiscal our effective tax rate for the current year was a negative compared to in the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the current year was impacted by an additional valuation allowance recorded during fiscal against all of our federal and certain state deferred tax assets 
net income for fiscal was a loss of million as compared to a loss of million in fiscal net loss per diluted share totaled in the current year compared to net loss of per diluted share in the prior year

during fiscal  sales were negatively affected by a weak retail environment for home furnishings which we believe is due to a number of factors including but not limited to continued weakness in the us economy  high unemployment  volatile capital markets  depressed housing prices and tight consumer lending practices as well as the use of highly promotional pricing strategies by the company s competitors 
these factors were partially offset by i the positive effects of our continued efforts to reposition the retail network  ii the introduction of our new american artisan product line  iii several new marketing initiatives including the launching of our new interactive web site ethanalleninc 
com and our rewards program  and in the latter part of the fiscal year  special savings pricing  and iv the continued use of national television media  where we emphasize to clients our interior design services and the full line of our quality product offerings 
wholesale revenue for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year

retail revenue from ethan allen operated design centers for the twelve months ended june  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the twelve months ended june  the decrease in retail sales by ethan allen operated design centers was attributable to a decrease in comparable design center delivered sales of million  or  and reduced revenue from sold and closed design centers of million 
this unfavorable variance was partially offset by higher sales generated by newly opened including relocated or acquired design centers of million

year over year  written business of ethan allen operated design centers decreased and comparable design center written business decreased 
over that same period  wholesale orders decreased 
retail written business reflects the softer retail environment for home furnishings noted throughout the current year  likely offset  to some degree  by i our continued efforts to reposition the retail network  ii recent product introductions  iii several new marketing initiatives described previously  and iv our continued use of national television as an advertising medium throughout much of the year

as a result of reduced sales  and to reduce inventories  manufacturing plants were operated at approximately of capacity 
this resulted in higher unabsorbed costs in our manufacturing plants which were charged to expense during the period

partially offsetting these decreases were i a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in the march quarter and ii an million period over period increase in restructuring and impairment charges  both discussed earlier  and iii added costs of million due to the implementation of the team concept which caused a temporary overlap of expenses 
consolidated operating income for the year ended june  totaled a loss of million  or of net sales  compared to income of million  or of net sales  in the prior year

the company may make restricted payments including dividends as long as availability equals or exceeds the greater of of the aggregate commitment or million 
if the average monthly availability is less than the greater of of the aggregate commitment and million  the company is also required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant which may not be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
the facility also contains customary borrowing conditions and events of default  the occurrence of which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings and terminate their commitment to make future loans

this was partially offset by an million lower reduction in inventory that while significant in fiscal  was a lower reduction than achieved in fiscal investing activities in fiscal  million more cash was used in investing activities than in fiscal this was due primarily to the million increase in restricted cash and investments and million purchase of marketable securities 
this was partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures and acquisitions of million  and an increase in proceeds from sale of property  plant and equipment primarily retail real estate of million 
the current level of capital spending is principally attributable to continued design center development and renovation  but at a reduced level from the prior two years  and expansion of our upholstery operations in mexico 
we anticipate that cash from operations will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures  business conditions permitting

in february and june  the company modified the program agreement to comply with recent changes in laws and made certain other changes to fees payable to the service provider 
any independent retailer choosing to participate in the consumer credit program is required to enter into a separate agreement with that same third party financial institution which sets forth the terms and conditions under which the retailer is to perform in connection with its offering of consumer credit to its customers the retailer agreement 
we have obligated ourselves on behalf of any independent retailer choosing to participate in our consumer credit program by agreeing  in the event of default  breach  or failure of the independent retailer to perform under such retailer agreement  to take on certain responsibilities of the independent retailer  including  but not limited to  delivery of goods and reimbursement of customer deposits 
customer receivables originated by independent retailers remain non recourse to ethan allen 
our obligation remains in effect for the term of the program agreement that expires in july while the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that we could be required to make under this obligation is indeterminable  recourse provisions exist that would enable us to recover  from the independent retailer  any amount paid or incurred by us related to our performance 
based on the underlying creditworthiness of our independent retailers  including their historical ability to satisfactorily perform in connection with the terms of our consumer credit program  we believe this obligation will expire without requiring funding by us 
to ensure funding for delivery of products sold  the terms of this agreement also contain a right for the credit card issuer to demand from the company collateral of up to million if the company does not meet certain covenants 
as of june   the company had established a restricted cash and investment collateral account of million to satisfy the current requirement under this demand 
product warranties our products  including our case goods  upholstery and home accents  generally carry explicit product warranties that extend from three to seven years and are provided based on terms that are generally accepted in the industry 
all of our domestic independent retailers are required to enter into  and perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of  a warranty service agreement 
we record provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and make periodic adjustments to those provisions to reflect actual experience 
on rare occasion  certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
in certain cases  a material warranty issue may arise which is beyond the scope of our historical experience 
we provide for such warranty issues as they become known and are deemed to be both probable and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that  from time to time  additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of our historical experience 
as of june   the company s product warranty liability totaled million 

table of contents impact of inflation we believe inflation had an impact on our business the last three fiscal years but we have generally been able to create operational efficiencies  seek lower cost alternatives  or raise selling prices in order to offset increases in product and operating costs 
it is possible in the future that we will not be successful in our efforts to offset the impacts from inflation 
business outlook while we cannot forecast  with any degree of certainty  changes in the various macro economic factors that influence the incoming order rate  we believe that we are well positioned to respond to both market weakness and economic growth based upon our existing business model which includes i an established brand  ii a comprehensive complement of home decorating solutions  and iii a vertically integrated operating structure 
as macro economic factors change  however  it is possible that our costs associated with production including raw materials and labor  distribution including freight and fuel charges  and retail operations including compensation and benefits  delivery and warehousing  occupancy  and advertising expenses may increase 
we cannot reasonably predict when  or to what extent  such events may occur or what effect  if any  such events may have on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the home furnishings industry remains extremely competitive with respect to both the sourcing of products and the retail sale of those products 
domestic manufacturers continue to face pricing pressures because of the manufacturing capabilities of other countries  specifically within asia 
in response to these pressures  a large number of us furniture manufacturers have increased their overseas sourcing activities in an attempt to maintain a competitive advantage and retain market share 
while we have also turned to overseas sourcing to remain competitive  we choose to differentiate ourselves by maintaining a substantial domestic manufacturing base 
consequently  we make and or assemble approximately of our products domestically 
we continue to believe that a balanced approach to product sourcing  which includes the domestic manufacture of certain product offerings coupled with the import of other selected products  provides the greatest degree of responsiveness and is the most effective approach to ensuring that acceptable levels of quality  service and value are attained 
our retail strategy involves i a continued focus on providing a wide array of product solutions and superior customer service  ii the opening of new or relocated design centers in more prominent locations  while encouraging independent retailers to do the same  iii leveraging the use of technology with personal service within our retail network  and iv further expansion internationally 
we believe this strategy provides an opportunity to grow our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exists primarily through our borrowing activities 
we utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund substantially all our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market 
table of contents rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
for floating rate obligations  interest rate changes do not affect the fair value of the underlying financial instrument but would impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate obligations  interest rate changes affect the fair value of the underlying financial instrument but would not impact earnings or cash flows 
at june   we had no floating rate debt obligations outstanding 
as of that same date  our fixed rate debt obligations consist  primarily  of the senior notes issued on september  the estimated fair value of the senior notes as of june   which is based on changes  if any  in interest rates and our creditworthiness subsequent to the date on which the debt was issued  and which has been determined using quoted market prices  was million as compared to a carrying value of million 
foreign currency exchange risk is primarily limited to our operation of five ethan allen operated retail design centers located in canada and our plant in mexico  as substantially all purchases of imported parts and finished goods are denominated in united states dollars 
as such  gains or losses resulting from market changes in the value of foreign currencies have not had  nor are they expected to have  a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies in particular asian relative to the united states dollar may affect the profitability of our vendors but as we employ a balanced sourcing strategy  we believe any impact would be moderated relative to peers in the industry
