critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories and any related reserves  income taxes  fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the board of directors audit and finance committee 
for a more detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on sales of products when the customer receives title to the goods  which is generally upon shipment or delivery depending on sales terms 
revenues are generally denominated in the currency of the country from which the product is shipped and are net of applicable returns and discounts 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and are maintained using the fifo first in  first out or specific identification method 
excess and obsolete cost reductions are generally established based on inventory age 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily major consumer product and wine and spirit companies and container manufacturers 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers in connection with our normal business activities and are carried at sales value less allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history  age and specific individual risks identified 
losses may also depend to some degree on current and future economic conditions 
although future conditions are unknown to us and may result in additional credit losses  we do not anticipate significant adverse credit circumstances in fiscal if we are unable to collect all or part of the outstanding receivable balance  there could be a material impact on the company s operating results and cash flows 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
the impairment test is completed based upon our assessment of the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the annual review for impairment of goodwill requires the use of estimates and assumptions which we believe are appropriate 
application of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 
the company s million of goodwill at march  relates primarily to the acquisition of collotype in the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal the first step of the impairment review compares the fair value of the company to the carrying value 
the fair value was calculated as of february  by calculating the multi color market capitalization and adding a control premium and comparing it to the company s shareholders equity balance 
the result of the first step did not indicate potential impairment as the estimated fair value of its reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by million 
as a result  the second step of the impairment test was not required 
reasonably possible fluctuations in the stock price and market capitalization did not indicate impairment 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired and the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment exists involves various estimates and assumptions  including the determination of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets involved in the review 
the cash flow estimates are based upon our historical experience  adjusted to reflect estimated future market and operating conditions 
measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value 
we base our estimates of fair values on quoted market prices when available  independent appraisals as appropriate and industry trends or other market knowledge 
changes in the market condition and or losses of a major production line could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis and reported book basis of assets and liabilities and result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
future changes in regulatory tax laws and or different positions held by taxing authorities may affect the amounts recorded for income taxes 
the benefits of tax positions are not recorded unless it is more likely than not the tax position would be sustained upon challenge by the appropriate tax authorities 
tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than a likelihood of being realized
