introduction management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes for the years ended december   and executive overview financial results 
for the year ended december   duke energy corporation duke energy reported net income attributable to duke energy of  million and basic and diluted earnings per share eps of  as compared to net income attributable to duke energy of  million and basic and diluted eps of and  respectively  for the year ended december  income from continuing operations was  million for as compared to  million for total reportable segment ebit defined below in segment results section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations decreased to  million in from  million in see results of operations below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations  as well as a detailed discussion of ebit results for each of duke energy s reportable business segments  as well as other 
areas of focus and accomplishments 
in  management was focused on managing through the economic recession  investing in modernization of duke energy s regulated infrastructure and dealing with increased competition in ohio 
managing through the economic recession and changing competitive landscapes 
in us franchised electric and gas  duke energy s largest business segment  weather normalized electric volumes were down approximately when compared to this was driven primarily by a decrease in industrial sales volumes  which were down approximately compared to although industrial sales volumes were down year over year  industrial volumes began to show signs of stabilization late in on a weather normalized basis  residential sales volumes were slightly positive  while commercial sales volumes were slightly negative 
looking forward to  management expects the load forecast to be relatively flat compared to in  commercial power s operations were impacted by the competitive markets in ohio  which were triggered by low commodity prices that put downward pressure on power prices 
the available capacity and lower prices provided opportunities for native load customers in ohio to switch generation suppliers 
competitive power suppliers began supplying power to current commercial power native load customers in ohio and commercial power experienced an increase in customer switching beginning in the second quarter of as of december   customer switching levels approximated of commercial power s native load 
however  through duke energy retail sales ders  commercial power acquired approximately of the switched load by offering customers a discount to the electric security plan esp price 
when factoring in the ders activity  commercial power experienced net customer switching of about  although those native load customers acquired by ders were at lower margins than customers served under the esp 
additionally  ders has been able to acquire new customers outside commercial power s native load territory 
as a result of lower forecasted energy prices  lower demand for electricity due to the economy and competitive pressures in ohio  and other valuation factors  a non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately million was recorded by commercial power in the third quarter of in light of the above economic factors that impacted duke energy s business in  management was focused on offsetting those economic pressures by successfully managing costs and achieving excellent operational performance 
duke energy achieved significant operations and maintenance cost mitigation goals across its business segments and also reduced planned capital expenditures by approximately million  which highlights duke energy s ability to take advantage of the flexibility within its capital spending plan 
additionally  duke energy s generation fleet operated at some of the highest levels in duke energy s history 
these combined efforts allowed duke energy to largely mitigate the negative impact of the economy on its results of operations in key regulatory accomplishments 
during  duke energy completed the following regulatory initiatives obtained favorable rate case outcomes in north carolina  south carolina  ohio and kentucky which will increase revenues by nearly million upon full implementation 
updated enabled construction work in progress cwip recovery for duke energy carolinas cliffside unit and the integrated gasification combined cycle igcc plant at duke energy indiana s edwardsport generating station 
received approval for cost recovery mechanisms for save a watt programs in north carolina  south carolina and ohio 
approval in indiana is anticipated in february began deployment of smartgrid in ohio  along with the initiation of a rate rider cost recovery mechanism  which is awaiting approval and a ruling is expected in the first quarter of additionally  duke energy was awarded a stimulus grant for approximately million to be used for reimbursement of costs related to smartgrid 
received approvals of wind  solar and other renewable energy projects  which will enable innovative renewable energy initiatives and help duke energy meet specific renewable energy standards over time 
overall  the regulatory and legislative accomplishments during have positioned duke energy well for and beyond 
capital expenditures and fleet and grid modernization 
duke energy s strategy for meeting customer demand  while building a sustainable business that allows its customers and its shareholders to prosper in a carbon constrained environment  includes significant commitments to renewable energy  customer energy efficiency  advanced nuclear power  advanced clean coal and high efficiency natural gas electric generating plants  and retirement of older less efficient coal fired power plants 
due to the likelihood of upcoming environmental regulations  including carbon legislation  air pollutant regulation by the us environmental protection agency epa and coal regulation  duke energy has been focused on modernizing its fleet in preparation for a low carbon future 
during  duke energy has continued the construction of cliffside unit in north carolina and the edwardsport igcc plant in indiana and these construction projects are approximately complete and complete  respectively  at december  both are scheduled to be placed in service during once in service  duke energy will begin retiring older  less efficient coal and gas fired units 
additionally  duke energy carolinas has begun construction on a megawatt mw combined cycle natural gas fired generating facility at each of its existing buck and dan river steam stations 
these facilities are scheduled to be placed in service in and  respectively 
in conjunction with these and other capital projects  management is continuing its focus on reducing regulatory lag  which refers to the period of time between making an investment and earning a return and recovering that investment 
in  the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc approved the timely recovery of initial construction cost estimates associated with the edwardsport igcc plant 
the rate case settlements in north carolina and south carolina included stipulations allowing for the recovery in base rates of financing costs related to cliffside unit  although the recovery is delayed in north carolina for a one year period 

table of contents part ii duke energy carolinas is also continuing to seek all necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed william states lee iii nuclear station  including the december filings of a combined construction and operating license col application with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and requests to incur up to million in development costs through  which were approved in although these actions are necessary steps as management continues to pursue the option of building a new nuclear plant  submitting these applications does not commit duke energy carolinas to build a nuclear unit 
in  duke energy made significant strides in adding to its existing renewable energy portfolio 
one way duke energy is reducing its environmental footprint while meeting demand for reliable  clean energy is by investing in zero carbon wind power 
during  commercial power  through duke energy generation services degs  brought approximately mw of wind generation online through a combination of completed construction and acquisition 
at december   degs had approximately mw of wind generation in commercial operation 
the wind assets in service have long term power purchase agreements to sell the output to an end customer 
additionally  degs became an owner in a biomass development joint venture and  in early  announced it would acquire a mw solar development project in san antonio  texas 
management is also making progress on increasing the role energy efficiency will have in meeting customers growing energy needs 
energy efficiency is considered a fifth fuel in the portfolio available to meet customers growing needs for electricity  along with coal  nuclear  natural gas and renewable energy 
during  duke energy s save a watt models were approved in north carolina  south carolina and ohio and duke energy is awaiting a decision on the proposed save a watt model in indiana  which is expected in the first quarter of the save a watt proposal in kentucky was withdrawn and will be addressed in duke energy kentucky s next general rate case 
duke energy objectives and beyond 
duke energy will continue to focus on operational excellence  shaping federal and state legislative and regulatory policy  continued modernization of infrastructure and investing in renewable energy  including energy efficiency 
the majority of future earnings are anticipated to be contributed from us franchised electric and gas  which consists of duke energy s regulated businesses that currently own a capacity of approximately  mw of generation 
the regulated generation portfolio consists of a mix of coal  nuclear  natural gas and hydroelectric generation  with the substantial majority of all of the sales of electricity coming from coal and nuclear generation facilities 
the favorable rate case outcomes reached in the various jurisdictions in  as discussed above  will increase us franchised electric and gas revenues by approximately million upon full implementation 
as a result of the downturn in the economy  duke energy experienced reductions in sales volumes in  most notably within the industrial customer class 
management anticipates that recessionary pressures will continue in  resulting in essentially flat kilowatt hour sales in both the carolinas and the midwest service territories 
in order to address these pressures  management is focused on containing costs in and currently expects non recoverable ie  not directly recovered via a rider or other mechanism operations and maintenance expense to be flat compared to  due largely to sustainable reductions achieved during  as well as certain initiatives such as a voluntary severance program and office consolidation 
in addition  management will continue efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes to reduce regulatory lag  including continually reviewing the need for general rate case filings in certain jurisdictions in and beyond 
additionally  due to the competitive markets in ohio  customer switching will continue to impact the results of the commercial power business  as management currently estimates that an incremental of current customer load will switch to alternative suppliers in management is focused on mitigating lost volume and margin erosion in through ders efforts to acquire native load customers  as well as acquiring customers outside of commercial power s ohio native load territory that are currently supplied by other electric generators 
during the three year period from through  duke energy anticipates total capital expenditures of approximately billion to billion 
of this amount  approximately billion is expected to be spent on committed projects  including base load power plants to meet long term growth in customer demand and to modernize the generation fleet  ongoing environmental projects  and nuclear fuel 
approximately billion of capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for overall system maintenance  customer connections  and corporate expenditures 
although these expenditures are ultimately necessary to ensure overall system maintenance and reliability  the timing of the expenditures may be influenced by broad economic conditions and customer growth 
the remaining estimated capital expenditures of approximately billion to billion are of a discretionary nature and relate to growth opportunities in which duke energy may invest  provided there are opportunities to meet return expectations along with assurance of constructive regulatory treatment in the regulated businesses 
discretionary capital primarily includes commercial power renewable and transmission projects  projects at international energy and renewable projects at us franchised electric and gas 
capital expenditures are currently estimated to be approximately billion in these expenditures are principally related to expansion plans  maintenance costs  environmental spending related to clean air act caa requirements and nuclear fuel 
duke energy is committed to adding base load capacity at a reasonable price while modernizing the current generation facilities by replacing older  less efficient plants with cleaner  more efficient plants 
significant expansion projects include the edwardsport igcc plant  an mw coal unit at duke energy carolinas existing cliffside facility and new gas fired generation units at duke energy carolinas existing dan river and buck steam stations  as well as other additions due to system growth 
additionally  duke energy is evaluating the potential construction of the william states lee iii nuclear power plant in cherokee county  south carolina 
duke energy anticipates capital expenditures at commercial power will primarily relate to growth opportunities  such as renewable energy generation projects and environmental control equipment  as well as maintenance on existing plants 
capital expenditures at international energy  which will be funded with cash held or raised by international energy  will primarily be for strategic growth opportunities  as well as maintenance on existing plants 
with the exception of equity issuances to fund the dividend reinvestment plan and other internal plans  duke energy does not currently anticipate the issuance of any other common equity in the foreseeable future 
duke energy expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets at reasonable rates and terms in additionally  duke energy has access to unsecured revolving credit facilities  which are not restricted upon general market conditions  with aggregate bank commitments of approximately billion 
at december   duke energy has available borrowing capacity of approximately billion under this facility 
for further information related to management s assessment of liquidity and capital resources  including known trends and uncertainties  see liquidity and capital resources below 
as the majority of duke energy s anticipated future capital expenditures are related to its regulated operations  a risk to duke energy is the ability to recover costs related to such expansion in a timely manner 
energy legislation passed in north carolina and south carolina in provides  among other things  mechanisms for duke energy to recover financing costs for new nuclear or coal base load generation during the construction phase 
in indiana  duke energy has received approval to recover its development costs for the new igcc plant at the edwardsport generating station 
duke energy has received approval for nearly million of future federal tax credits related to costs to be incurred for the modernization of cliffside unit  as well as the igcc plant in indiana 
in addition  duke energy has received general assurances from the north carolina utilities commission ncuc that the north carolina allocable portion of development costs associated with the william states lee iii nuclear station will be recoverable through a future rate case proceeding as long as the costs are deemed prudent and reasonable 
duke energy does not anticipate beginning construction of the proposed nuclear power plant without adequate assurance of cost recovery from the state legislators or regulators 

table of contents part ii in summary  duke energy is coordinating its future capital expenditure requirements with regulatory initiatives in order to ensure adequate and timely cost recovery while continuing to provide low cost energy to its customers 
economic factors for duke energy s business 
duke energy s business model provides diversification between stable regulated businesses like us franchised electric and gas and certain portions of commercial power s operations  and the traditionally higher growth businesses like the unregulated portion of commercial power s operations and international energy 
as was the case throughout much of  all of duke energy s businesses can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy  including low market prices of commodities  all of which are beyond duke energy s control  and could impair duke energy s ability to meet its goals for and beyond 
as duke energy experienced in  declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns reduce overall electricity sales and have the potential to lessen duke energy s cash flows  especially as industrial customers reduce production and  thus  consumption of electricity 
a weakening economy could also impact duke energy s customer s ability to pay  causing increased delinquencies  slowing collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivables  bad debts and financing requirements 
a portion of us franchised electric and gas business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses 
the esp in ohio also helps mitigate a portion of the risk associated with certain portions of commercial power s generation operations by providing mechanisms for recovery of certain costs associated with  among other things  fuel and purchased power for native load customers 
if negative market conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of duke energy s individual assets  including goodwill  do not exceed the carrying value of those individual assets  asset impairments may occur in the future under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations 
a change in management s intent about the use of individual assets held for use versus held for sale could also result in impairments or losses 
duke energy s goals can also be substantially at risk due to the regulation of its businesses 
duke energy s businesses in the united states us are subject to regulation on the federal and state level 
regulations  applicable to the electric power industry  have a significant impact on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate 
new legislation and changes to regulations are ongoing  including anticipated carbon legislation  and duke energy cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory or political environment or the ultimate effect that any such future changes will have on its business 
duke energy s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices 
exposure to commodity prices generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses as there are timing differences as to when such costs are recovered in rates 
to mitigate these risks  duke energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively hedge some  but not all  known exposures 
additionally  duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose duke energy to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  fluctuations in currency rates  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact duke energy s future results 
duke energy also relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow from operations 
an inability to access capital at competitive rates or at all could adversely affect duke energy s ability to implement its strategy 
market disruptions or a downgrade of duke energy s credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more sources of liquidity 
additionally  there are no assurances that commitments made by lenders under duke energy s credit facilities will be available if needed as a source of funding due to ongoing uncertainties in the financial services industry

table of contents part ii year ended december  as compared to december  operating revenues 
the decrease was driven primarily by a million decrease in fuel revenues including emission allowances driven primarily by decreased demand from retail and near term wholesale customers and lower natural gas fuel rates primarily in ohio and kentucky  partially offset by higher fuel rates for electric retail customers 
fuel revenues represent sales to both retail and wholesale customers  a million decrease due to lower weather normalized sales volumes to retail customers largely reflecting the overall declining economic conditions in  which primarily impacted the industrial sector  a million decrease in gwh and thousand cubic feet mcf sales to retail customers due to overall milder weather conditions in compared to weather statistics for heating degree days in were unfavorable in the midwest but favorable in the carolinas compared to weather statistics for cooling degree days in were unfavorable in both the midwest and carolinas compared to  and a million net decrease in wholesale power revenues  net of sharing  primarily due to decreased sales volumes and lower prices on near term sales as a result of weak market conditions  partially offset by higher prices and increased sales volumes to customers served under certain long term contracts 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million net increase in retail rates and rate riders primarily due to increases in recoveries of duke energy indiana s environmental compliance costs and the igcc rider  partially offset by the expiration of the one time increment rider related to merger savings that was included in north carolina retail rates in operating expenses 
the decrease was driven primarily by a million decrease in fuel expense including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale primarily due to a lower volume of coal used in electric generation  lower prices and volumes for natural gas purchased for resale and used in electric generation and reduced purchased power  partially offset by higher coal prices  a million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower scheduled outage and maintenance costs at nuclear and fossil generating stations  lower power and gas delivery maintenance and decreased capacity costs due to the expiration of certain drought mitigation contracts in  partially offset by higher benefits costs  and a million decrease in depreciation and amortization due primarily to lower depreciation rates in the carolinas  partially offset by increases in depreciation due primarily to additional capital spending 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in property and other taxes due primarily to normal increases 
gains losses on sales of other assets and other  net 
the increase is primarily due to gains on the sale of nitrogen oxide nox emission allowances in other income and expenses  net 
the increase is due primarily to a higher equity component of afudc earned from additional capital spending for ongoing construction projects  partially offset by a favorable iurc ruling 
ebit 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower weather adjusted sales volumes  milder weather  lower wholesale power revenues  higher benefits costs and higher property and other taxes 
these negative impacts were partially offset by decreased operation and maintenance costs as a result of lower outage and maintenance costs  lower depreciation rates in the carolinas and overall net higher rates and rate riders 
matters impacting future us franchised electric and gas results us franchised electric and gas continues to increase the overall number of retail customers served  maintain low costs and deliver high quality customer service in the carolinas and midwest  however  sales to all retail customer classes were negatively impacted by the economic downturn in  particularly sales to the industrial sector 
these trends are expected to continue for some period into  and perhaps beyond  until the economy begins to recover 
the general decline in the textile industry in the carolinas  exacerbated by the struggling economy  is also expected to continue in  fueled by the expiration of certain import limitations related to foreign textile products 
us franchised electric and gas evaluates the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of august and performs interim impairment assessments if a triggering event occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for further information on key assumptions that impact us franchised electric and gas goodwill impairment assessments  see critical accounting policy for goodwill impairment assessments 
as of the date of the annual impairment analysis  the fair value of us franchised electric and gas reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value  thus no goodwill impairment charges were recorded 
however  the fair value of the ohio transmission and distribution reporting unit ohio t d  which had a goodwill balance of approximately million as of december   exceeded the carrying value of equity by less than 
management is continuing to monitor the impact of recent market and economic events to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the ohio t d reporting unit has been impaired 
should any such triggering events or circumstances occur in that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit below its carrying value  management would perform an interim impairment assessment of the ohio t d goodwill and it is possible that a goodwill impairment charge could be recorded as a result of this assessment 
potential circumstances that could have a negative effect on the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit include additional declines in load volume forecasts  changes in the weighted average cost of capital wacc  changes in the timing and or recovery of and on investments in smartgrid technology  and the success of future rate case filings 
year ended december  as compared to december  operating revenues 
the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in fuel revenues including emission allowances driven primarily by higher fuel rates in all regions and legislative changes that allow duke energy carolinas to collect additional purchased power and environmental compliance costs from retail customers 
fuel revenues represent sales to both retail and wholesale customers  and a million increase related to substantial completion in of the sharing of anticipated merger savings through rate decrement riders with regulated customers 

table of contents part ii partially offsetting these increases were a million decrease in weather adjusted sales volumes to retail customers reflecting the overall declining economic conditions  which are primarily impacting the industrial sector  a million decrease in retail rates and rate riders primarily related to the new retail base rates implemented in north carolina in the first quarter of  net of increases in recoveries of duke energy indiana s environmental compliance costs from retail customers and higher gas base rates implemented in the second quarter of for duke energy ohio  and a million decrease in gwh and mcf sales to retail customers due to milder weather in compared to while weather statistics for heating degree days in were favorable compared to  this favorable impact was more than offset by the impact of fewer cooling degree days in compared to operating expenses 
the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in fuel expense including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale primarily due to higher coal and natural gas prices and increased purchased power 
this increase also reflects a million reimbursement in first quarter of previously incurred fuel expenses resulting from a settlement between duke energy carolinas and us department of justice doj resolving duke energy carolinas used nuclear fuel litigation against the department of energy doe 
the settlement between the parties was finalized on march   a million increase in depreciation due primarily to additional capital spending  and a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to higher scheduled outage and maintenance costs at nuclear and fossil generating plants  storm costs primarily in the midwest related to hurricane ike in september net of deferral of a portion of the ohio and kentucky storm costs associated with hurricane ike  increased capacity costs due to additional contracts that were entered into in late to ensure customer electricity needs were met despite ongoing drought conditions and increased power delivery maintenance charges to increase system reliability  partially offset by lower benefit costs including short term incentives 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in regulatory amortization expenses  including approximately million for the amortization of compliance costs related to north carolina clean air legislation  which was completed in this decrease was partially offset by the write off in of a portion of the investment in the gridsouth regional transmission organization rto approximately million per a rate order from the ncuc

matters impacting future commercial power results commercial power s current strategy is focused on maintaining its competitive position in ohio  maximizing the returns and cash flows from its current portfolio  as well as growing its non regulated renewable energy portfolio 
results for commercial power are sensitive to changes in power supply  power demand  fuel and power prices and weather  as well as dependent upon completion of energy asset construction projects and tax credits on renewable energy production 
recently  low commodity prices have put downward pressure on power prices 
the available capacity and lower prices have provided opportunities for customers in ohio to switch generation suppliers 
competitive power suppliers have begun supplying power to current commercial power customers in ohio and commercial power has experienced an increase in customer switching in the second half of customer switching is anticipated to continue in and could have a significant impact on commercial power s results 
additionally  these evolving market conditions may potentially impact commercial power s ability to continue to apply regulatory accounting treatment to certain portions of its commercial power business segment 
as of december   commercial power had regulatory assets of approximately million related to under collections under its esp and mark to market losses on certain economic hedges 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill and intangible assets  commercial power recorded an impairment charge in the third quarter of of approximately million within its non regulated generation reporting unit to write down the goodwill to its implied fair value 
as a result of this impairment charge  the carrying value of goodwill associated with the non regulated generation reporting unit of approximately million is equivalent to its implied fair value 
this impairment charge was based on a number of factors  including a decline in load forecast  depressed market power prices  customer switching and carbon emission legislation and or epa regulation developments 
should the assumptions used related to these factors change in the future as a result of then market conditions  as well as any acceleration in the timing of carbon emission legislation epa regulation developments  it is possible that further goodwill impairment charges could be recorded

matters impacting future international energy results international energy s current strategy is focused on selectively growing its latin american power generation business while continuing to maximize the returns and cash flow from its current portfolio 
ebit results for international energy are sensitive to changes in hydrology  power supply  power demand  transmission and fuel constraints and fuel and commodity prices 
regulatory matters can also impact ebit results  as well as impacts from fluctuations in exchange rates  most notably the brazilian real 
certain of international energy s long term sales contracts and long term debt in brazil contain inflation adjustment clauses 
while this is favorable to revenue in the long run  as international energy s contract prices are adjusted  there is an unfavorable impact on interest expense resulting from revaluation of international energy s outstanding local currency debt 

table of contents part ii as noted above  international energy is committed to selectively growing its latin american power generation business while continuing to maximize the returns and cash flow from its current portfolio 
however  international energy periodically evaluates all of its businesses to ensure those businesses continue to align with its overall strategies 
as such  international energy is in the early stages of exploring a possible sale of certain long lived assets in latin america 
the estimated fair value for these assets currently being evaluated for potential sale is less than carrying value 
consistent with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  write downs to fair value have not been recorded on these long lived assets as the forecasted undiscounted cash flows for the assets exceed the carrying value

for investments in debt securities  the other than temporary analysis also involves the consideration of underlying collateral and guarantees of principal by government entities  as well as other factors relevant to determine the amount of credit loss  if any 
in january  duke energy announced plans to offer a voluntary severance plan to approximately  eligible employees 
as this is a voluntary plan  all severance benefits offered under this plan are considered special termination benefits under gaap 
special termination benefits are measured upon employee acceptance and recorded immediately absent a significant retention period 
if a significant retention period exists  the costs of the special termination benefits are recorded ratably over the remaining service periods of the affected employees 
the window for employees to request to voluntarily end their employment under this plan opened on february  and closed on february  for approximately  eligible employees 
for employees affected by the consolidation of duke energy s corporate functions in charlotte  north carolina  as discussed further below  the window will close march  duke energy currently estimates severance payments associated with this voluntary plan  based on employees requests to voluntarily end their employment received through february   of approximately million 
however  until management of duke energy approves the requests  it reserves the right to reject any request to volunteer based on business needs and or excessive participation 
in addition  in january  duke energy announced that it will consolidate certain corporate office functions  resulting in transitioning over the next two years of approximately positions from its offices in the midwest to its corporate headquarters in charlotte  north carolina 
employees who do not relocate have the option to elect to participate in the voluntary plan discussed above  find a regional position within duke energy or remain with duke energy through a transition period  at which time a reduced severance benefit would be paid under duke energy s ongoing severance plan 
management cannot currently estimate the costs  if any  of severance benefits which will be paid to its employees due to this office consolidation 
duke energy believes that it is possible that the voluntary severance plan may trigger settlement accounting or curtailment accounting with respect to its pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
at this time  management is unable to determine the likelihood that settlement or curtailment accounting will be triggered 
additionally  duke energy has a ownership interest in crescent  a partnership for us tax purposes 
crescent filed for chapter bankruptcy in a us bankruptcy court in june as of december   duke energy believes it is more likely than not that all tax benefits associated with its investment in crescent will be realized 
however  the form  timing and structure of crescent s future emergence from bankruptcy remain unresolved 
based on this uncertainty  as of december   it is reasonably possible that duke energy could incur a future tax liability related to its inability to fully utilize tax losses associated with its partnership interest in crescent and the resolution of crescent s emergence from bankruptcy

critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as duke energy s operations change and accounting guidance evolves 
duke energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various assumptions that they believe are reasonable at the time of application 
the estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about duke energy s environment becomes available 
if estimates and judgments are different than the actual amounts recorded  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information 
duke energy discusses its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
duke energy s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
regulatory accounting certain of duke energy s regulated operations primarily the majority of us franchised electric and gas and certain portions of commercial power meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment 
as a result  duke energy records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under gaap in the us for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that either are not likely to or have yet to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in duke energy s jurisdictions  recent rate orders to other regulated entities  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
based on this continual assessment  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
additionally  the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  plant and equipment  recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets 
total regulatory assets were  million as of december  and  million as of 
table of contents part ii december  total regulatory liabilities were  million as of december  and  million as of december  for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters 
in order to apply regulatory accounting treatment and record regulatory assets and liabilities  certain criteria must be met 
in determining whether the criteria are met for its operations  management makes significant judgments  including determining whether revenue rates for services provided to customers are subject to approval by an independent  third party regulator  whether the regulated rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing the regulated service  and a determination of whether  in view of the demand for the regulated services and the level of competition  it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover the operations costs can be charged to and collected from customers 
this final criterion requires consideration of anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition  direct and indirect  during the recovery period for any capitalized costs 
if facts and circumstances change so that a portion of duke energy s regulated operations meet all of the scope criteria when such criteria had not been previously met  regulatory accounting treatment would be reapplied to all or a separable portion of the operations 
such reapplication includes adjusting the balance sheet for amounts that meet the definition of a regulatory asset or regulatory liability 
commercial power owns  operates and manages power plants in the midwestern united states 
commercial power s generation asset fleet consists of duke energy ohio s generation in ohio  primarily coal fired assets  that are dedicated to serve ohio native load customers native load  as well as wholesale customers to the extent there is excess generation  and five midwestern gas fired non regulated generation assets that are not dedicated to serve ohio native load customers non native 
the non native generation operations do not qualify for regulatory accounting treatment as these operations do not meet the scope criteria 
most of the generation asset native load output in ohio was contracted through the rsp through december  as discussed further in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  specifically note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  regulatory matters  beginning on december   commercial power began applying regulatory accounting treatment to certain portions of its native load operations due to the passing of ohio senate bill sb and the approval of the esp 
however  other portions of commercial power s native load operations continue to not qualify for regulatory accounting treatment  as certain costs of the native load operations do not result in a rate structure designed to recover the specific costs of that portion of the operations 
despite certain portions of the ohio native load operations not qualifying for regulatory accounting treatment  all of commercial power s ohio native load operations rates are subject to approval by the puco  and thus these operations are referred to here in as commercial power s regulated operations 
moreover  generation remains a competitive market in ohio and native load customers continue to have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service 
as customers switch  there is a risk that some or all of commercial power s regulatory assets will not be recovered through the established riders 
duke energy will continue to monitor the amount of native load customers that have switched to alternative suppliers when assessing the recoverability of its regulatory assets established for its native load generation operations 
at december   management has concluded that the established regulatory assets of approximately million are still probable of recovery even though there have been increased levels of customer switching 
no other operations within commercial power  and no operations within the international energy business segment  qualify for regulatory accounting treatment 
the substantial majority of us franchised electric and gas s operations qualify for regulatory accounting treatment and thus its costs of business and related revenues can result in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities  as described above 
goodwill impairment assessments at december  and  duke energy had goodwill balances of  million and  million  respectively 
at december   the goodwill balances at the segment level were  million at us franchised electric and gas  million at commercial power  and million at international energy 
the majority of duke energy s goodwill relates to the acquisition of cinergy in april  whose assets are primarily included in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
commercial power also has approximately million of goodwill that resulted from the september acquisition of catamount  a leading wind power company located in rutland  vermont 
as of the acquisition date  duke energy allocates goodwill to a reporting unit  which duke energy defines as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
duke energy is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level as of the same date each year and  accordingly  performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill for all reporting units as of august each year 
duke energy updates the test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the annual analysis of the potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
step one of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  step two must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of the goodwill impairment loss 
if the carrying amount is less than fair value  further testing of goodwill impairment is not performed 
duke energy did not record any impairment on its goodwill as a result of the or impairment tests 
step two of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of the goodwill 
under step two  determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit s identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date 
the difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment charge  if any  would be the difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and the implied fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two 
for purposes of the step one analyses  determination of reporting units fair value was based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on estimated discounted future cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries 
based on completion of step one of the annual impairment tests  management determined that the fair values of all reporting units except for commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit  for which the carrying value of goodwill was approximately million as of the annual impairment testing date  were greater than their respective carrying values 
accordingly  for only commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit  management was required to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit includes nearly  mw of coal fired generation capacity in ohio dedicated to serve ohio native load customers under the esp through december  these assets  as excess capacity allows  also generate revenues through sales outside the native load customer base  and such revenue is termed non native 
additionally  this reporting unit has approximately  mw of gas fired generation capacity in ohio  pennsylvania  illinois and indiana 
the businesses within commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit operate in an unregulated environment in ohio 
as a result  the operations within this reporting unit are subjected to competitive pressures that do not exist in any of duke energy s regulated jurisdictions 
commercial power s other businesses  including the wind generation assets  are in a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
no impairment exists with respect to commercial power s wind generation assets 

table of contents part ii the fair value of the non regulated midwest generation reporting unit is impacted by a multitude of factors  including current and forecasted customer demand  current and forecasted power and commodity prices  impact of the economy on discount rates  valuation of peer companies  competition  and regulatory and legislative developments 
management s assumptions and views of these factors continually evolves  and such views and assumptions used in determining the step one fair value of the reporting unit in changed significantly from those used in the annual impairment test 
these factors had a significant impact on the risk adjusted discount rate and other inputs used to value the non regulated midwest generation reporting unit 
these factors significantly impacted management s valuation of the reporting unit  and consequently resulted in an approximate million goodwill impairment charge in as noted above  for purposes of the step one analyses  determination of the reporting units fair values was based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on discounted future cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries 
key assumptions used in the income approach analyses for the us franchised electric and gas reporting units include  but are not limited to  the use of an appropriate discount rate  estimated future cash flows and estimated run rates of operation  maintenance  and general and administrative costs 
in estimating cash flows  duke energy incorporates expected growth rates  regulatory stability and ability to renew contracts  as well as other factors  into its revenue and expense forecasts 
estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on duke energy s internal business plan  and adjusted as appropriate for duke energy s views of market participant assumptions 
in addition to the factors noted above for the commercial power non regulated midwest generation reporting unit  duke energy s internal business plan reflects management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party sources  as well as projected commodity pricing data 
the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of returns on equity  anticipated earnings returns related to significant future capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts 
management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operation  maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events 
should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of duke energy s reporting units to be significantly different in future periods 
one of the most significant assumptions that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows 
management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc for each individual reporting unit 
the wacc takes into account both the cost of equity and pre tax cost of debt 
in calculating the waccs  duke energy considered implied wacc s for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate wacc rates to use 
as each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations  including factors such as regulation  the wacc for each reporting unit may differ 
accordingly  the waccs were adjusted  as appropriate  to account for company specific risk premiums 
for example  transmission and distribution reporting units generally would have a lower company specific risk premium as they do not have the higher level of risk associated with owning and operating generation assets nor do they have significant construction risk or risk associated with potential future carbon legislation or carbon regulation 
the discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of august  for each of duke energy s domestic reporting units were commensurate with the risks associated with each reporting unit and ranged from to 
for duke energy s international operations  a base discount rate of was used  with specific adders used for each separate jurisdiction in which international energy operates to reflect the differing risk profiles of the jurisdictions and countries 
this resulted in discount rates for the august  goodwill impairment test for the international operations ranging from approximately to 
another significant assumption that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the long term growth rate of the businesses for purposes of determining a terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period 
a long term growth rate of three percent was used in the valuations of all of the us franchised electric and gas reporting units  reflecting the median long term inflation rate and the significant capital investments forecasted for all of the us franchised electric and gas reporting units 
a long term growth rate of two percent was used in the valuation of the commercial power non regulated midwest generation reporting unit given the finite lives of the unregulated generation power plants and current absence of plans to reinvest in the unregulated generation assets 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time  subsequent changes  particularly changes in the discount rates or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows  could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate 
as discussed above  with the exception of the commercial power non regulated midwest generation reporting unit  the impairment tests as of august  did not indicate that the fair value of any of duke energy s reporting units were less than its book value 
for these reporting units  the estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by over  with the exception of us franchised electric and gas s ohio t d reporting unit 
as of december   the ohio t d reporting unit had a goodwill balance of approximately million 
potential circumstances that could have a negative effect on the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit include additional declines in load volume forecasts  changes in the wacc  changes in the timing and or recovery of and on investments in smartgrid technology  and the success of future rate case filings 
as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the reporting units  duke energy reconciled the combined fair value estimates of its reporting units to its market capitalization as of august  the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were reasonably representative of market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization 
additionally  duke energy would perform an interim impairment assessment should any events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
subsequent to august   management did not identify any indicators of potential impairment that required an update to the annual impairment test 
the majority of duke energy s business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate regulated 
in such environments  revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs  sales volumes and costs of capital 
accordingly  duke energy s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects  positive or negative  of significant swings in market or economic conditions 
additionally  with respect to the commercial power non regulated midwest generation reporting unit  the ohio generation assets have begun to be negatively impacted by increased competition 
however  the effects of increased competition in ohio were appropriately considered in the august  valuation of the reporting unit  and subsequent to august  management did not identify any indicators of potential impairment that required an update to the annual impairment test 
however  management will continue to monitor changes in the business  as well as overall market conditions and economic factors that could require additional impairment tests

the securitization transaction was structured to meet the criteria for sale accounting treatment under the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets and  accordingly  the transfers of receivables are accounted for as sales 
receivables for unbilled retail and wholesale revenues of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  were included in the sales of accounts receivables to cinergy receivables 
effective january   duke energy began consolidating cinergy receivables as a result of the adoption of new accounting rules  under which the criteria for sale accounting treatment is not met 
accounting for loss contingencies duke energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business 
in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  management makes judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and records a loss contingency when it is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly reviews current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties  such as federal  state and local courts and other regulators 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved  which could have a material impact on future results of operations  financial position and cash flows of duke energy 
duke energy has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted by duke energy carolinas on its electric generation plants prior to amounts recognized as asbestos related reserves related to duke energy carolinas in the consolidated balance sheets totaled approximately million and  million as of december  and  respectively  and are classified in other within deferred credits and other liabilities and other within current liabilities 
these reserves are based upon the minimum amount in duke energy s best estimate of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims filed against duke energy carolinas after in light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer term forecast  management does not believe that they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after related to such potential claims 
asbestos related loss estimates incorporate anticipated inflation  if applicable  and are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
these reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  the nature of the alleged injury  and the average cost of resolving each such claim could change our estimated liability  as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial 
a federal legislative solution  further state tort reform or structured settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability 
given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous other factors outside our control  management believes that it is possible duke energy carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to duke energy carolinas asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy carolinas cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by duke energy s third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is  million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of approximately million and  million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating

accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining duke energy s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation recorded against duke energy s net deferred tax assets  if any 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the use of tax planning that could impact the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  a valuation allowance may be recorded against certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the impacts of various items  including changes to income tax laws  duke energy s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant judgment is also required in computing duke energy s quarterly effective tax rate etr 
etr calculations are revised each quarter based on the best full year tax assumptions available at that time  including  but not limited to  income levels  deductions and credits 
in accordance with interim tax reporting rules  a tax expense or benefit is recorded every quarter to adjust for the difference in tax expense computed based on the actual year to date etr versus the forecasted annual etr 
with the adoption of new income tax accounting guidance on january   duke energy began recording unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
duke energy records the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant 
table of contents part ii management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
undistributed foreign earnings associated with international energy s operations are considered indefinitely reinvested  thus no us tax is recorded on such earnings 
this assertion is based on management s determination that the cash held in international energy s foreign jurisdictions is not needed to fund the operations of its us operations and that international energy either has invested or has plans to reinvest such earnings 
while management currently plans to indefinitely reinvest all of international energy s unremitted earnings  should circumstances change  duke energy may need to record additional income tax expense in the period in which such determination changes 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes 
pension and other post retirement benefits the calculation of pension expense  other post retirement benefit expense and pension and other post retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
duke energy believes that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post retirement benefits are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
additionally  medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical to duke energy s estimates of other post retirement benefits 
funding requirements for defined benefit db plans are determined by government regulations 
duke energy made voluntary contributions to its db retirement plans of approximately million in  zero in and million in additionally  during  duke energy contributed approximately million to its other post retirement benefit plans 
duke energy plans duke energy and its subsidiaries including legacy cinergy businesses maintain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans plans 
the plans cover most us employees using a cash balance formula 
under a cash balance formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage which may vary with age and years of service of current eligible earnings and current interest credits 
certain legacy cinergy employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula 
under a final average earnings formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest year average earnings  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation maximum of years  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings times years of participation in excess of years 
duke energy also maintains non qualified  non contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain executives 
duke energy and most of its subsidiaries also provide some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non contributory basis 
certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement  as defined in the plans 
duke energy recognized pre tax qualified pension cost of million in in  duke energy s pre tax qualified pension cost is expected to be approximately million higher than in as a result of an increase in net actuarial loss amortization in  primarily attributable to the effect of negative actual returns on assets from duke energy recognized pre tax nonqualified pension cost of million and pre tax other post retirement benefits cost of million  in in  pre tax non qualified pension cost and pre tax other post retirement benefits costs are expected to remain approximately the same as for both pension and other post retirement plans  duke energy assumed that its plan s assets would generate a long term rate of return of as of december  the assets for duke energy s pension and other post retirement plans are maintained in a master trust 
the investment objective of the master trust is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants 
the asset allocation target was set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile with respect to the trust 
us equities are held for their high expected return 
us equities  debt securities  and real estate are held for diversification 
investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments 
duke energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
duke energy also invests other post retirement assets in the duke energy corporation employee benefits trust veba i and the duke energy corporation post retirement medical benefits trust veba ii 
the investment objective of the vebas is to achieve sufficient returns  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants 
the vebas are passively managed 
the expected long term rate of return of for the plan s assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers 
the weighted average returns expected by asset classes were for us equities  for non us equities  for global equities  for fixed income securities  and for real estate 
duke energy discounted its future us pension and other post retirement obligations using a rate of as of december  duke energy determines the appropriate discount based on a yield curve approach 
under the yield curve approach  expected future benefit payments for each plan are discounted by a rate on a third party bond yield curve corresponding to each duration 
the yield curve is based on a bond universe of aa and aaa rated long term corporate bonds 
a single discount rate is calculated that would yield the same present value as the sum of the discounted cash flows 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in duke energy s pension and post retirement plans will impact duke energy s future pension expense and liabilities 
management cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future

liquidity and capital resources known trends and uncertainties at december   duke energy had cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion  of which approximately million is held in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund the operations of and investments in international energy 
to fund its liquidity and capital requirements during  duke energy will rely primarily upon cash flows from operations  borrowings  equity issuances to fund the dividend reinvestment plan drip and other internal plans and its existing cash and cash equivalents 
the relatively stable operating cash flows of the us franchised electric and gas business segment compose a substantial portion of duke energy s cash flows from operations and it is anticipated that it will continue to do so for the next several years 
a material adverse change in operations  or in available financing  could impact duke energy s ability to fund its current liquidity and capital resource requirements 
ultimate cash flows from operations are subject to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory constraints  economic trends and market volatility see item a 
risk factors for details 
duke energy projects capital and investment expenditures of approximately billion  primarily consisting of billion at us franchised electric and gas billion at commercial power billion at international energy and billion at other duke energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors 
based on this goal  approximately of total projected capital expenditures are allocated to the us franchised electric and gas segment 
total us franchised electric and gas projected capital and investment expenditures include approximately billion for system growth  billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants and infrastructure to serve load growth  approximately billion of nuclear fuel and approximately billion of environmental expenditures 
with respect to the capital expenditure plan  duke energy has flexibility within its billion budget to defer or eliminate certain spending should the broad economy continue to deteriorate 
of the billion budget  approximately billion relates to projects for which management has committed capital  including  but not limited to  the continued construction of cliffside unit and the edwardsport igcc plant  and management intends to spend those capital dollars in irrespective of broader economic factors 
approximately billion of projected capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for overall system maintenance  customer connections and corporate expenditures 
although these expenditures are ultimately necessary to ensure overall system maintenance and reliability  the timing of the expenditures may be influenced by broad economic conditions and customer growth  thus management has more flexibility in terms of when these dollars are actually spent 
the remaining planned capital expenditures of approximately billion are of a discretionary nature and relate to growth opportunities in which duke energy may invest  provided there are opportunities to meet return expectations 
as a result of duke energy s significant commitment to modernize its generating fleet through the construction of new units  as well as its focus on increasing its renewable energy portfolio  the ability to cost effectively manage the construction phase of current and future projects is critical to ensuring full and timely recovery of costs of construction within its regulated operations 
should duke energy encounter 
table of contents part ii significant cost overruns above amounts approved by the various state commissions  and those amounts are disallowed for recovery in rates  future cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
duke energy anticipates its debt to total capitalization ratio to remain at approximately in in  duke energy currently anticipates issuing additional net debt of approximately billion at the operating subsidiary level  primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures 
due to the flexibility in the timing of projected capital expenditures  the timing and amount of debt issuances throughout could be influenced by changes in the timing of capital spending 
additionally  duke energy plans to generate approximately million of cash from the issuance of common stock under its drip and other internal plans 
duke energy has access to unsecured revolving credit facilities  which are not restricted upon general market conditions  with aggregate bank commitments of approximately billion 
at december   duke energy has available borrowing capacity of approximately billion under this facility 
management currently believes that amounts available under its revolving credit facility are accessible should there be a need to generate additional short term financing in  such as the issuance of commercial paper  however  due to the sustained downturn in overall economic conditions  specifically in the financial services sector  there is no guarantee that commitments provided by financial institutions under the revolving credit facility will be available if needed 
management expects that cash flows from operations  issuances of debt and cash generated from the issuance of common stock under the drip and other internal plans will be sufficient to cover the funding requirements related to capital and investments expenditures and dividend payments 
duke energy monitors compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions and does not currently believe it will be in violation or breach of its significant debt covenants during however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view 
if and when management had a belief that such potential breach could exist  appropriate action would be taken to mitigate any such issue 
duke energy also maintains an active dialogue with the credit rating agencies 
operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million in  compared to  million in  an increase in cash provided of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by excluding the impacts of non cash impairment charges  net income increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in  and changes in traditional working capital amounts due to timing of cash receipts and cash payments  principally a net increase in cash from taxes of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in coal inventory  partially offset by an approximate million increase in contributions to company sponsored pension plans

table of contents part ii other financing matters 
in october  duke energy filed a registration statement form s with the sec 
under this form s  which is uncapped  duke energy  duke energy carolinas  duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts  prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings 
the registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by duke energy 
duke energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for consecutive years and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future 
there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the board of directors 
dividend and other funding restrictions of duke energy subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters  duke energy s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy via dividend  advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with duke energy s merger with cinergy 
additionally  certain other duke energy subsidiaries have other restrictions  such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy 
at december   the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of duke energy that may not be distributed to duke energy in the form of a loan or dividend is approximately billion 
however  duke energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated retained earnings account 
although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to duke energy  management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on duke energy s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements duke energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties 
these arrangements include performance guarantees  stand by letters of credit  debt guarantees  surety bonds and indemnifications 
most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by duke energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries  non consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities  enabling them to conduct business 
as such  these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility of duke energy  either on its own or on behalf of spectra energy capital  llc spectra capital through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the spin off of spectra energy  having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
duke energy performs ongoing assessments of its guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been triggered as a result of potential increased non performance risk by parties for which duke energy has issued guarantees 
except for certain performance obligations related to crescent  which filed chapter bankruptcy petitions in a us bankruptcy court in june and for which a liability of approximately million was recorded during due to the probability of performance under certain guarantees  it is not probable as of december  that duke energy will have to perform under its remaining existing guarantee obligations 
however  management continues to monitor the financial condition of the third parties or non wholly owned entities for whom duke energy has issued guarantees on behalf of to determine whether performance under these guarantees becomes probable in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further details of the guarantee arrangements 
issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of duke energy s operations 
thus  if duke energy discontinued issuing these guarantees  there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
duke energy ohio  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky have an agreement to sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections to cinergy receivables  which purchases  on a revolving basis  nearly all of the retail accounts receivable and related collections of duke energy ohio  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky 
cinergy receivables is not consolidated by duke energy since it meets the requirements to be accounted for as a qualifying special purpose entity qspe 
duke energy ohio  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky each retain an interest in the receivables transferred to cinergy receivables 
the transfers of receivables are accounted for as sales under the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets 
for a more detailed discussion of the sale of certain accounts receivable  see note to the consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities 
with the adoption of new accounting rules related to variable interest entities vies and transfers and servicing of financial assets on january   duke energy began consolidating cinergy receivables as of that date 
duke energy also holds interests in other vies  both consolidated and unconsolidated 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities 
other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease arrangements  duke energy does not have any material off balance sheet financing entities or structures 
for additional information on these commitments  see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 

table of contents part ii contractual obligations duke energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods  based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices 
the following table summarizes duke energy s contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented 
it is expected that the majority of current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets will be paid in cash in contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years beyond in millions long term debt a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations h firm capacity and transportation payments c energy commodity contracts d other purchase  maintenance and service obligations e other funding obligations f total contractual cash obligations g a see note to the consolidated financial statements  debt and credit facilities 
amount includes interest payments over life of debt 
interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using interest rates derived from the interpolation of the forecast interest rate curve 
in addition  a spread was placed on top of the interest rates to aid in capturing the volatility inherent in projecting future interest rates 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
amounts in the table above include the interest component of capital leases based on the interest rates explicitly stated in the lease agreements 
c includes firm capacity payments that provide duke energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity  and natural gas transportation contracts 
d includes contractual obligations to purchase physical quantities of electricity  coal  nuclear fuel and limestone 
also  includes contracts that duke energy has designated as hedges  undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as normal purchase normal sale npns 
for contracts where the price paid is based on an index  the amount is based on forward market prices at december  for certain of these amounts  duke energy may settle on a net cash basis since duke energy has entered into payment netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
e includes contracts for software  telephone  data and consulting or advisory services 
amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering  procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and nuclear plant refurbishments  environmental projects on fossil facilities  major maintenance of certain non regulated plants  maintenance and day to day contract work at certain wind facilities and commitments to buy wind and combustion turbines ct 
amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand  for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined 
f relates to future annual funding obligations to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund ndtf see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
g the table above excludes certain obligations discussed herein related to amounts recorded within deferred credits and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of future cash flows necessary to settle these obligations 
the amount of cash flows to be paid to settle the asset retirement obligations is not known with certainty as duke energy may use internal resources or external resources to perform retirement activities 
as a result  cash obligations for asset retirement activities are excluded from the table above 
however  the vast majority of asset retirement obligations will be settled beyond asset retirement obligations recognized on the consolidated balance sheets total  million and the fair value of the ndtf  which will be used to help fund these obligations  is  million at december  the table above excludes reserves for litigation  environmental remediation  asbestos related injuries and damages claims and self insurance claims see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies because duke energy is uncertain as to the timing of when cash payments will be required 
additionally  the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business  including nuclear insurance see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  funding of pension and other post retirement benefit plans see note to the consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans and regulatory liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain 
also excluded are deferred income taxes and investment tax credits recorded on the consolidated balance sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year 
additionally  amounts related to uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above due to uncertainty of timing of future payments 
h current liabilities  except for current maturities of long term debt  and purchase obligations reflected in the consolidated balance sheets  have been excluded from the above table 

table of contents part ii quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies duke energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  credit exposure  interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
duke energy s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels 
the finance and risk management committee of the board of directors receives periodic updates from the chief risk officer and other members of management on market risk positions  corporate exposures  credit exposures and overall risk management activities 
the chief risk officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk  including monitoring exposure limits 
commodity price risk duke energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
duke energy s exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost based regulation of its us franchised electric and gas operations and certain portions of commercial power s operations as these regulated operations are typically allowed to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses  including the fuel clause 
while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered through rates  changes from year to year have no material impact on operating results of these regulated operations 
additionally  most of duke energy s long term power sales contracts substantially shift all fuel price risk to the purchaser 
price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities 
duke energy s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors  including contract size  length  market liquidity  location and unique or specific contract terms 
duke energy employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations  which may include using various commodity derivatives  such as swaps  futures  forwards and options 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
validation of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from duke energy s deal origination areas 
while duke energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques  changes in duke energy s pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition 
hedging strategies 
duke energy closely monitors the risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and  where appropriate  uses various commodity instruments such as electricity  coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations 
duke energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel 
certain derivatives used to manage duke energy s commodity price exposure are accounted for as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
to the extent that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the consolidated statements of operations until after delivery or settlement occurs 
accordingly  assumptions and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported earnings prior to settlement 
several factors influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract  including the use of contracts with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk 
hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured at least quarterly 
in addition to the hedge contracts described above and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  duke energy enters into other contracts that qualify for the npns exception 
when a contract meets the criteria to qualify as a npns  us franchised electric and gas and commercial power apply such exception 
income recognition and realization related to normal purchases and normal sales contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of power 
for contracts qualifying for the npns exception  no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring 
other derivatives used to manage duke energy s commodity price exposure are either not designated as a hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts 
undesignated derivatives entered into by regulated businesses reflect mark to market changes of the derivative instruments fair value as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
undesignated derivatives entered into by unregulated businesses are marked to market each period  with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings 
generation portfolio risks for duke energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power  natural gas  and coal prices in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
duke energy optimizes the value of its bulk power marketing and non regulated generation portfolios 
the portfolios include generation assets power and capacity  fuel  and emission allowances 
the component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units 
the generation portfolio not utilized to serve native load or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations  although the impact on the consolidated statements of operations reported earnings is partially offset by mechanisms in the regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a price change per mwh in forward wholesale power prices would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  excluding the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying or undesignated hedges relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date  which are discussed further below 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a change in the forward price per ton of coal would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  excluding the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying or undesignated hedges relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a price change per million british thermal unit mmbtu in natural gas prices would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  excluding the impact of mark to market changes on undesignated hedges relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date  which are discussed further below 
sensitivities for derivatives beyond derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond are also exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power and coal 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a price change in the forward price per mwh of wholesale power would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  resulting from the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying and undesignated power contracts pertaining to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a change in the forward price per ton of coal would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million 
table of contents part ii in and  resulting from the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying and undesignated coal contracts pertaining to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
other commodity risks 
at december  and  pre tax income in and was not expected to be materially impacted for exposures to other commodities price changes 
the commodity price sensitivity calculations above consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels  but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that duke energy would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
to reduce credit exposure  duke energy seeks to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
duke energy attempts to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable duke energy to obtain collateral or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events 
duke energy may  at times  use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third party credit enhancement of duke energy s counterparties obligations 
duke energy also obtains cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements  where appropriate  based on its financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction 
duke energy s industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts 
duke energy frequently uses master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures 
the collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold 
the threshold amount represents an unsecured credit limit  determined in accordance with the corporate credit policy 
collateral agreements also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions 
duke energy s principal customers for power and natural gas marketing and transportation services are industrial end users  marketers  local distribution companies and utilities located throughout the us and latin america 
duke energy has concentrations of receivables from natural gas and electric utilities and their affiliates  as well as industrial customers and marketers throughout these regions 
these concentrations of customers may affect duke energy s overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector 
where exposed to credit risk  duke energy analyzes the counterparties financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to duke energy carolinas asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy carolinas cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by duke energy s third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is  million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of approximately million and  million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating 
duke energy and its subsidiaries also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance guarantees  letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties 
where duke energy has issued these guarantees  it is possible that duke energy could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform 
where duke energy has issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale  duke energy attempts to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further information on guarantees issued by duke energy or its subsidiaries 
duke energy is also subject to credit risk of its vendors and suppliers in the form of performance risk on contracts including  but not limited to  outsourcing arrangements  major construction projects and commodity purchases 
duke energy s credit exposure to such vendors and suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non performance 
based on duke energy s policies for managing credit risk  its exposures and its credit and other reserves  duke energy does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non performance by any counterparty 
interest rate risk duke energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper 
duke energy manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
duke energy also enters into financial derivative instruments  which may include instruments such as  but not limited to  interest rate swaps  swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure 
see notes    and to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities  fair value of financial assets and liabilities  and debt and credit facilities 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   it was estimated that if market interest rates average higher lower in than in  interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would increase decrease by approximately million 
comparatively  based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   had interest rates averaged higher lower in than in  it was estimated that interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would have increased decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable rate securities outstanding  adjusted for interest rate hedges  short term and long term investments  cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of december  and the decrease in interest rate sensitivity is primarily due to a decrease in tax exempt bonds and commercial paper  partial repayment of the master credit facility borrowings  and increased cash balances 
if interest rates changed significantly  management would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in duke energy s financial structure 

table of contents part ii marketable securities price risk as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements  investments in debt and equity securities  duke energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations of the business 
the vast majority of the investments in equity securities are within the ndtf and assets of the various pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
ndtf 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations  duke energy maintains trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities  debt securities  fixed income securities  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
per nrc and ncuc requirements  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
the investments are exposed to price fluctuations in debt and equity markets 
accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through us franchised electric and gas rates  therefore  fluctuations in equity prices do not affect duke energy s consolidated statements of operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities 
earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through us franchised electric and gas rates over time 
management monitors the ndtf investment portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the following table provides the fair value of investments held in the ndtf at december  fair value at december  in millions equity securities corporate debt securities us government bonds municipal bonds other total pension plan assets 
duke energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and other post retirement benefit plans 
those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
duke energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings  which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held 
duke energy s target asset allocation for equity securities is approximately of the value of the plan assets and the holdings are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment  sector or geographic region 
a significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require duke energy to increase its funding of the pension plan in future periods  which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods 
additionally  a decline in the fair value of plan assets  absent additional cash contributions to the plan  could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods  which could adversely affect duke energy s results of operations in those periods 
during  duke energy contributed approximately million to its qualified pension plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  for additional information on pension plan assets 
foreign currency risk duke energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international affiliate businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the us dollar and or local inflation rates  or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency 
duke energy may also use foreign currency derivatives  where possible  to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations 
to monitor its currency exchange rate risks  duke energy uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
in  duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the brazilian real 
a devaluation in the currency exchange rates as of december  in all of duke energy s exposure currencies would result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations in the consolidated balance sheet would be negatively impacted by approximately million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in aoci as of december  as a result of a devaluation in the currency exchange rates 
for comparative purposes  as of december   a devaluation in the currency exchange rates in all of duke energy s exposure currencies was expected to result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations and a reduction of approximately million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in aoci as of december  other issues global climate change 
although there is still much to learn about the causes and long term effects of climate change  many  including duke energy  advocate taking steps now to begin reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions with the long term aim of stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of ghgs at a level that avoids any potentially worst case effects of climate change 
the epa publishes an inventory of man made us ghg emissions annually 
carbon dioxide co  a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion  currently accounts for about of total us ghg emissions 
duke energy s ghg emissions consist primarily of co and most come from its fleet of coal fired power plants in the us in  duke energy s us power plants emitted approximately million tons of us 
the co emissions from duke energy s international electric operations are less than million tons annually 
duke energy s future co emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations  economic conditions that affect electricity demand  and duke energy s decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs 
congress has not yet passed legislation mandating control or reduction of ghgs 
on june   the u 
s 
house of representatives passed hr the american clean energy and security act of aces 
this legislation includes a ghg cap and trade program that covers approximately of the ghg emissions in the us economy  including emissions from the electric utility sector 
the legislation also includes a combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard that applies to the electric utility sector 
the standard establishes 
table of contents part ii minimum requirements for the amount of renewable energy electric utilities must provide to end use customers on an annual basis 
it allows companies to comply by providing renewable energy  buying renewable energy credits from other companies or the government  or by reducing customer electricity demand through the deployment of energy efficiency programs 
on november   the us senate environment and public works committee passed and sent to the senate floor s 
the clean energy jobs and american power act of s 

the legislation included an economy wide cap and trade program similar to the one contained in aces 
the senate energy and natural resources committee had previously passed legislation containing new requirements for energy efficiency and for a renewable electricity standard 
no further senate action has been taken on either bill since passage out of their respective committees 
the debates that took place in the us senate in and make it clear that there are wide ranging views among senators regarding what constitutes acceptable climate change legislation 
these divergent views  the state of the economy  the current structure of the senate necessitating votes to move legislation and the political pressures as the mid term election approaches  make passage of federal climate change legislation in the senate in highly uncertain 
if the senate were to pass some type of climate change legislation in  the senate legislation would need to be reconciled with aces 
this adds another layer of uncertainty to the prospects for enactment of climate change legislation in on december   the epa finalized an endangerment finding for greenhouse gases under the caa 
the endangerment finding does not impose any regulatory requirements on industry  but is a necessary prerequisite for the epa to be able to finalize its proposed ghg emission standard for new motor vehicles 
it is expected that the epa will finalize its new motor vehicle rule by the end of march implementation of the new motor vehicle rule may trigger permitting requirements and potentially ghg emission control requirements for new and existing major stationary sources of ghg emissions which would include all of duke energy s fossil fuel facilities 
the epa has stated that permitting requirements for ghgs will not apply to stationary sources in the epa has also proposed the tailoring rule  which is expected to be finalized by the end of march this rule is intended to provide relief from the epa s ghg regulations for certain types of stationary sources  but not electric generating facilities 
there is  at present  considerable uncertainty over the timing and the specific requirements that would apply to any stationary source that might potentially be subject to ghg permitting and emission reduction requirements as a result of the epa s rules 
although duke energy does not anticipate taking actions that would trigger the ghg permitting requirements or ghg emission reduction requirements at any of its existing generating facilities  if it were to do so  the current uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the rules and the requirements that might apply prevent management from being able to determine at this time whether the epa rules will have a material impact on duke energy s future results of operations 
numerous groups have already filed petitions with the dc circuit court of appeals for review of the epa s endangerment finding 
it is likely that the epa s upcoming new motor vehicle and tailoring rules will also be challenged in court once they are finalized 
the current and expected legal challenges create additional uncertainty with respect to the epa rules and what regulatory requirements  if any  will result from the rules 
duke energy supports the enactment of workable federal ghg legislation 
duke energy prefers federal legislation over any epa regulation of ghg emissions under the current caa and believes that any legislation must include provisions that block the epa from doing so and provide that the legislative program is the sole remedy for a source s ghg emissions 
to permit the economy to adjust rationally to the policy  legislation should establish a long term program that first slows the growth of emissions  stops them and then transitions to a gradually declining emissions cap as new lower and zero emitting technologies are developed and become available for wide scale deployment at a reasonable cost 
federal legislation should also include effective cost containment measures to protect the us economy from harmful consequences if compliance costs are excessive 
duke energy is unable to determine the potential cost of complying with unspecified and unknowable future ghg legislation or any indirect costs that might result  however  such costs could be significant 
duke energy s cost of complying with any legislatively mandated federal ghg emissions regulations will depend upon the design details of the program  and upon the future levels of duke energy s ghg emissions that might be regulated under the program 
if potential future federal ghg legislation mandates a cap and trade approach  for example  the design elements of such a program that will have the greatest influence on duke energy s compliance costs include i the level of the emissions cap over time  ii the ghg emission sources covered under the cap  iii the number of allowances that duke energy might be allocated at no cost on a year to year basis  iv the type and effectiveness of any cost containment measures that may be included in the program  v the role of emission offsets in the program  vi the availability and cost of technologies that will be available for duke energy to deploy to lower its emissions over time  and vii the price of allowances and emission offsets 
although duke energy believes it is likely that congress will adopt mandatory ghg emission reduction legislation at some point  the timing and design details of any such legislation are highly uncertain at this time 
assuming that a federal ghg cap and trade program is eventually enacted  duke energy s compliance obligation under such a program would generally be determined by the difference between the level of its emissions in a given year and the number of no cost allowances it receives for that year 
this difference would represent the emission reductions that duke energy would need to achieve to comply and or the number of allowances and or offsets duke energy would need to purchase to comply  or a combination of the two 
the cost of achieving the emission reductions and or the cost of purchasing the needed allowances and or emission offsets would represent duke energy s compliance costs 
this is why the more no cost allowances duke energy receives  the lower its compliance obligation will be  and the lower its compliance cost will be 
this is also why actions duke energy is taking today to reduce its ghg emissions over time will lower its exposure to any future ghg regulation 
under any future scenario involving mandatory ghg limitations  duke energy would plan to seek to recover its compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
although a near term compliance strategy under a ghg cap and trade program might be focused primarily on the purchase of allowances and or offsets due to the lack of available emission reduction technologies and or the time it would take to deploy technologies once they become available  it is likely that over time there would be more focus placed on deploying technology to achieve large scale reductions in emissions 
this strategy could involve replacing some existing coal fired generation with new lower and zero emitting generation technologies  and or installing new carbon capture and sequestration technology when the technologies become ready for deployment 
although there is uncertainty about what new technologies may be developed  when they may be deployed  and what their costs will be  duke energy currently is focused on advanced nuclear generation  igcc with co capture and sequestration  and cocapture and storage retrofit technology for existing pulverized coal fired generation as promising technologies for generating electricity with lower or no co emissions 
duke energy is also making a significant commitment to increased customer energy efficiency and promoting enhanced use of renewable energy for meeting customers electricity needs 
duke energy s actions are designed to build a sustainable business that allows our customers and our shareholders to prosper in what is expected to be a carbon constrained environment 
at the state level  the midwestern governors association launched an initiative several years ago called the midwestern greenhouse gas reduction accord accord 
one of the objectives of the initiative was to produce a model rule for implementing a ghg cap and trade system on a regional level for consideration by individual states 
in october  the accord produced a draft model rule  and plans to finalize the document in early once finalized  the model rule will be available to states for their consideration and possible adoption and implementation 
the states of ohio and indiana  where duke energy has electric generation operations  have been observers to the 
table of contents part ii accord process and have shown no interest in adopting the model rule 
based on the current position of indiana and ohio in this regard  duke energy does not anticipate any cost impacts from the initiative 
in december  duke energy began the regulatory process to construct a new nuclear power plant  william states lee iii nuclear station  in south carolina  by petitioning the nrc for a col 
if constructed  this facility would produce virtually no ghgs 
with regard to advanced clean coal  duke energy is in the process of constructing an igcc power plant in indiana 
one of the key features of the igcc technology is that it has the potential to support the capture of its co emissions  with subsequent underground storage of the captured co although the igcc plant  scheduled to begin operations in  is not currently being equipped with the technology to capture co  space was included in the design of the plant for this technology to be added later 
duke energy is working to complete in early the front end engineering and design of a co capture facility 
the deployment of co capture and storage technology would help duke energy comply with any future ghg emission reduction requirements 
the state legislatures of north carolina and ohio have passed laws that require duke energy to meet increasing percentages of its customers electricity needs with renewable energy and customer energy efficiency 
in north carolina the requirement reaches in and in ohio it reaches a minimum of in duke energy will be meeting these requirements through a variety of actions and each is expected to assist duke energy s overall effort to reduce its co emissions 
versions of an energy efficiency and renewable electricity standard have been passed by the house as part of aces and by the senate energy and natural resources committee in s 
given the current challenges associated with passing comprehensive federal climate change legislation  congress could instead attempt to pass energy legislation in that includes a federal energy efficiency and renewable electricity standard provisions both the full house and a senate committee have approved  albeit at different levels 
if this were to occur  duke energy s compliance with the north carolina and ohio requirements would further its ability to comply with whatever federal requirements congress might enact 
in addition to relying on new technologies to reduce its co emissions  duke energy has filed for regulatory approval in most of the states in which it operates for its energy efficiency programs  which will help meet customer electricity needs by increasing energy efficiency  thereby reducing demand instead of relying almost exclusively on new power plants to generate electricity 
duke energy has received regulatory approval from ohio  north carolina and south carolina and is in the process of rolling programs out in these states 
duke energy received regulatory approval from indiana and has withdrawn its filing in kentucky 
duke energy recognizes that certain groups associate frequent and severe extreme weather events with climate change and the associated damage to the electric distribution system and the possibility that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should these events occur 
however  the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency  duration  and severity  the long period of time over which any changes might take place  and the inability to predict these accurately  make estimating any potential future financial risk to duke energy s operations that may be caused by the physical risks of climate change impossible 
currently  duke energy plans and prepares for extreme weather events that it experiences from time to time  such as ice storms  tornados  severe thunderstorms  high winds and droughts 
duke energy s past experiences preparing for and responding to the impacts of these types of weather related events would reasonably be expected to help management plan and prepare for future climate change related severe weather events to reduce  but not eliminate  the operational  economic and financial impacts of such events 
duke energy also routinely takes steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on its electric distribution systems 
duke energy does not currently operate in coastal areas and therefore is not exposed to the effects of potential sea level rise 
duke energy s electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without damage 
duke energy maintains an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential short term disruption in its fuel supply so it can continue to provide its customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity

new accounting standards the following new accounting standard updates asu have been issued  but have not yet been adopted by duke energy  as of december  accounting standards codification asc transfers and servicing 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  to require additional information about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  as well as additional information about an enterprise s continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
this revised accounting guidance eliminates the concept of a qspe and requires those entities which were not subject to consolidation under previous accounting rules to now be assessed for consolidation 
in addition  this accounting guidance clarifies and amends the derecognition criteria for transfers of financial assets including transfers of portions of financial assets and requires additional disclosures about a transferor s continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
for duke energy  this revised accounting guidance is effective prospectively for transfers of financial assets occurring on or after january   and early adoption of this statement is prohibited 
since  duke energy ohio  duke energy indiana  and duke energy kentucky have sold  on a revolving basis  nearly all of their accounts receivable and related collections through cinergy receivables  a bankruptcy remote qspe 
the securitization transaction was structured to meet the criteria for sale accounting treatment  and accordingly  duke energy has not consolidated cinergy receivables  and the transfers have been accounted for as sales 
upon adoption of this revised accounting guidance  the accounting treatment and or financial statement presentation of duke energy s accounts receivable securitization programs will be impacted as cinergy receivables will be consolidated by duke energy as of january  see note for additional information 
asc consolidations 
in june  the fasb amended existing consolidation accounting guidance to eliminate the exemption from consolidation for qspes  and clarified  but did not significantly change  the criteria for determining whether an entity meets the definition of a vie 
this revised accounting guidance also requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie based on whether that enterprise has both the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of a vie and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of a vie that could potentially be significant to a vie 
in addition  this revised accounting guidance modifies existing accounting guidance to require an ongoing evaluation of a vie s primary beneficiary and amends the types of events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
furthermore  this accounting guidance requires enterprises to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with vies and any significant changes in their risk exposure due to that involvement 
for duke energy  this accounting guidance is effective beginning on january   and is applicable to all entities in which duke energy is involved with  including entities previously subject to existing accounting guidance for vies  as well as any qspes that exist as of the effective date 
early adoption of this revised accounting guidance is prohibited 
upon adoption of this revised accounting guidance  the accounting treatment and or financial statement presentation of duke energy s accounts receivable securitization programs will be impacted as cinergy receivables will be consolidated by duke energy effective january  duke energy is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this revised accounting guidance on its other interests in vies and is unable to estimate at this time the impact of adoption on its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position
