item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and commercializes pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
we currently have one marketed product arcalyst rilonacept injection for subcutaneous use  which is available for prescription in the united states for the treatment of cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes caps  including familial cold auto inflammatory syndrome fcas and muckle wells syndrome mws in adults and children and older 
we also have eight product candidates in clinical development  including three product candidates that are in late stage phase clinical development 
our late stage programs are rilonacept  which is being developed for the prevention and treatment of gout related flares  vegf trap eye  which is being developed in eye diseases using intraocular delivery in collaboration with bayer healthcare  and aflibercept vegf trap  which is being developed in oncology in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
our earlier stage clinical programs are regn  an antibody to nerve growth factor ngf  which is being developed for the treatment of pain  regn  an antibody to the interleukin receptor il r  which is being developed in rheumatoid arthritis  regn  an antibody to delta like ligand dll  which is being developed in oncology  regn  an antibody to pcsk  which is being developed for ldl cholesterol reduction  and regn  an antibody to the interleukin receptor il r  which is being developed for certain allergic and immune conditions 
all five of our early stage clinical programs are fully human antibodies that are being developed in collaboration with sanofi aventis 
our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis  ophthalmology  metabolic and related diseases  muscle diseases and disorders  inflammation and immune diseases  bone and cartilage  pain  cardiovascular diseases  and infectious diseases 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
since inception we have not generated any significant sales or profits from the commercialization of arcalyst or any of our other product candidates 
before significant revenues from the commercialization of arcalyst or our other product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of significant revenues from the commercialization of arcalyst rilonacept or our other product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  and source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we continue the clinical development of vegf trap eye and rilonacept in other indications  advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs utilizing our technology for discovering fully human monoclonal antibodies  continue our research and development programs  and commercialize additional product candidates that receive regulatory approval  if any 
also  our activities may expand over time and require additional resources  and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on  among other factors  the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive from collaborators 
as a company that does not expect to be profitable over the next several years  management of cash flow is extremely important 
the most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities  which include drug discovery  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we are reimbursed for some of these research and development activities by our collaborators 
our principal sources of cash to date have been from i sales of common equity  both in public offerings and to our collaborators  including sanofi aventis  ii funding from our collaborators and licensees in the form of up front and milestone payments  research progress payments  and payments for our research and development activities  and iii a private placement of convertible debt  which was repaid in full during in  our research and development expenses totaled million 
in  we expect these expenses to increase substantially as we continue to expand our research and preclinical and clinical development activities  primarily in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was compared with in and in in and our average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded research and development activities in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
in our average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded development programs for vegf trap eye and rilonacept and our plans to move our first antibody candidate into clinical trials 
in  we expect our average headcount to increase to approximately  primarily to support the further expansion of our research  development  and marketing activities as described above  especially in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
in our clinical programs  key events in and to date were  and plans for the remainder of are  as follows clinical program and events to date plans rilonacept also known as il trap initiated patient enrollment in two phase trials pre surge and pre surge evaluating rilonacept in the prevention of gout flares associated with the initiation of urate lowering drug therapy  completed patient enrollment in the pre surge study initiated and completed patient enrollment in a phase study surge evaluating rilonacept in the treatment of acute gout flares report data from surge and pre surge during the first half of complete patient enrollment of the remaining phase studies in gout vegf trap eye intravitreal injection completed patient enrollment in the phase wet amd program view and view initiated a phase crvo program reported results from the phase dme trial report data from view and view trials in the fourth quarter of complete patient enrollment of the phase crvo trials aflibercept vegf trap oncology completed patient enrollment in the phase studies in non small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer initiated a phase st line study in metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy reported results of a phase single agent study in symptomatic malignant ascites sma discontinued a phase study in metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with chemotherapy complete patient enrollment in the phase study in colorectal cancer during the second half of  an independent data monitoring committee is expected to conduct an interim analysis of the phase study in colorectal cancer monoclonal antibodies regn initiated a phase trial in healthy volunteers  a dose ranging  proof of concept study in osteoarthritis of the knee  and additional proof of concept studies in pain associated with sciatica  vertebral fracture  chronic pancreatitis  and thermal injury regn initiated a phase dose ranging study in rheumatoid arthritis and a phase dose ranging study in ankylosing spondylitis regn initiated a phase trial in oncology regn initiated a phase program in healthy volunteers regn initiated a phase program in healthy volunteers regn report data from the study in osteoarthritis of the knee during the first half of and from the study in sciatica during the second half of regn report proof of concept data from the phase program and initiate a phase program for ldl cholesterol reduction regn initiate a phase program in the treatment of a chronic allergic condition regn report data from a phase trial in rheumatoid arthritis advance additional antibody candidate s into clinical development critical accounting policies and use of estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in note to our financial statements  beginning on page f the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires an assumption or assumptions regarding a future outcome  and changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
the critical accounting estimates that impact our financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue we earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms 
we currently have collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
the terms of collaboration agreements typically include non refundable up front licensing payments  research progress milestone payments  and payments for development activities 
non refundable up front license payments  where continuing involvement is required of us  are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement  and adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based on the applicable facts and circumstances 
payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone  involving a degree of risk  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non refundable  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related product candidate  such as completion of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies  and approvals by regulatory agencies 
in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone  we take into consideration i the nature  timing  and value of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related development product candidate  ii the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone  and iii the relative level of risk in achieving the milestone  taking into account the high degree of uncertainty in successfully advancing product candidates in a drug development program and in ultimately attaining an approved drug product 
payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized over the related performance period 
we enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities 
we may share the costs of research and development activities with our collaborator  such as in our vegf trap eye collaboration with bayer healthcare  or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our research and development activities  such as in our aflibercept and antibody collaborations with sanofi aventis 
we record our internal and third party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses 
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration  we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses 
if the collaboration is a cost sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs  in periods when our collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and regeneron  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of the collaborator s development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in connection with non refundable licensing payments  our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope  progress  and results of our research and development activities 
due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product  changes to development plans as programs progress  and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically  and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  we extended our estimated performance period in connection with the up front and non substantive milestone payments previously received from bayer healthcare pursuant to the companies vegf trap eye collaboration and shortened our estimated performance period in connection with up front payments from sanofi aventis pursuant to the companies aflibercept collaboration 
the net effect of these changes in our estimates resulted in the recognition of million less in collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter of  compared to amounts recognized in connection with these deferred payments in each of the prior three quarters of in addition  in connection with amendments to expand and extend our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis  during the fourth quarter of  we extended our estimated performance period related to the up front payment previously received from sanofi aventis pursuant to the companies antibody collaboration 
the effect of this change in estimate resulted in the recognition of million less in collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter of  compared to amounts recognized in each of the prior three quarters of also  if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination 
product revenue in march  arcalyst rilonacept became available for prescription in the united states for the treatment of caps 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
revenue and deferred revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for prompt pay discounts  product returns  estimated rebates payable under governmental programs including medicaid  distributor fees  and other sales related costs 
since we have limited historical return and rebate experience for arcalyst  product sales revenues are deferred until i the right of return no longer exists or we can reasonably estimate returns and ii rebates have been processed or we can reasonably estimate rebates 
we review our estimates of rebates payable each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period s net product sales 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities  utilizing external entities such as contract research organizations  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately  while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by contract research organizations cros 
cros typically perform most of the start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training  and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these start up costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range can be significantly wider  as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget  while start up costs for the particular trial may not change materially 
these start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and or penalties 
for clinical study sites  where payments are made periodically on a per patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue expense on an estimated cost per patient basis  based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter 
the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study  the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter  the required level of patient enrollment  the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop out of the clinical study  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements  and span multiple years 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results  which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december    or stock based employee compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock to employees and non employee members of our board of directors under our long term incentive plans based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the grant date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award s requisite service period 
we use the black scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors option grants 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation expense also includes an estimate  which is made at the time of grant  of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited 
this estimate is revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock based compensation recognized in future periods 
in addition  we have granted performance based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements 
potential compensation cost  measured on the grant date  related to these performance options will be recognized only if  and when  we estimate that these options will vest  which is based on whether we consider the options performance conditions to be probable of attainment 
our estimates of the number of performance based options that will vest will be revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods 
changes in these estimates may materially affect the amount of stock based compensation that we recognize in future periods related to performance based options 
marketable securities we have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities and  to a lesser extent  investment grade debt securities issued by corporations  bank deposits  and asset backed securities 
we consider our marketable securities to be available for sale  as defined by authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
these assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if the decline in the value of a marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other than temporary  we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that may be charged against income 
on a quarterly basis  we review our portfolio of marketable securities  using both quantitative and qualitative factors  to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other than temporary 
such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of investment advisors  and forecasts of economic  market  or industry trends 
with respect to debt securities  this review process also includes an evaluation of our intent to sell an individual debt security or our need to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or maturity 
with respect to equity securities  this review process includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold the securities until their full value can be recovered 
this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment 
as a result of our quarterly reviews of our marketable securities portfolio  during   and we recorded charges for other than temporary impairment of our marketable securities totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
the current economic environment and the deterioration in the credit quality of issuers of securities that we hold increase the risk of potential declines in the current market value of marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
such declines could result in charges against income in future periods for other than temporary impairments and the amounts could be material 
depreciation of property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
results of operations years ended december  and net loss regeneron reported a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted for the decrease in our net loss in was principally due to higher collaboration revenue in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis  receipt of a million substantive performance milestone payment in connection with our vegf trap eye collaboration with bayer healthcare  and higher arcalyst rilonacept sales  partially offset by higher research and development expenses  as detailed below 
revenues revenues in and consist of the following in millions collaboration revenue sanofi aventis bayer healthcare total collaboration revenue technology licensing revenue net product sales contract research and other revenue total revenue sanofi aventis collaboration revenue the collaboration revenue we earn from sanofi aventis  as detailed below  consists primarily of reimbursement for research and development expenses and recognition of revenue related to non refundable up front payments of million related to the aflibercept collaboration and million related to the antibody collaboration

recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi aventis up front aflibercept payments increased in compared to due to shortening the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized  effective in the fourth quarter of as of december   million of the original million of up front payments related to aflibercept was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
in  sanofi aventis reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of million under the discovery agreement and million of development costs under the license agreement  compared to million and million  respectively  in the higher reimbursement amounts in compared to were due to an increase in our research activities conducted under the discovery agreement and increases in our development activities for antibody candidates under the license agreement 
recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi aventis million up front payment decreased in compared to due to the november amendments to expand and extend the companies antibody collaboration 
as of december   million of the original million up front payment was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
in august  we entered into a separate velocigene agreement with sanofi aventis 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in revenue related to this agreement 
bayer healthcare collaboration revenue the collaboration revenue we earn from bayer healthcare  as detailed below  consists of cost sharing of regeneron vegf trap eye development expenses  substantive performance milestone payments  and recognition of revenue related to a non refundable million up front payment and a million milestone payment received in august which  for the purpose of revenue recognition  was not considered substantive 
years ended december  bayer healthcare collaboration revenue in millions cost sharing of regeneron vegf trap eye development expenses substantive performance milestone payment recognition of deferred revenue related to up front and other milestone payments total bayer healthcare collaboration revenue cost sharing of our vegf trap eye development expenses with bayer healthcare increased in compared to under the terms of the collaboration  in  all agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses incurred by regeneron and bayer healthcare under a global development plan were shared equally 
in  the first million of agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses were shared equally  and we were solely responsible for up to the next million 
during the fourth quarter of  we were solely responsible for most of the collaboration s vegf trap eye development expenses  which reduced the amount of cost sharing revenue we earned from bayer healthcare in in addition  cost sharing revenue increased in  compared to  due to higher clinical development costs in connection with our view trial in wet amd  phase trial in dme  and phase trial in crvo 
in july  we received a million substantive performance milestone payment from bayer healthcare in connection with the dosing of the first patient in a phase trial of vegf trap eye in crvo  which was recognized as collaboration revenue 
recognition of deferred revenue related to the up front and august milestone payments from bayer healthcare decreased in from due to an extension of the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized  effective in the fourth quarter of as of december   million of these up front licensing and milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
technology licensing revenue in connection with our velocimmune license agreements with astrazeneca and astellas  each of the million annual  non refundable payments are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement 
in both and  we recognized million of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements 
net product sales in and  we recognized as revenue million and million  respectively  of arcalyst rilonacept net product sales for which both the right of return no longer exists and rebates can be reasonably estimated 
at december   deferred revenue related to arcalyst net product sales totaled million 
contract research and other revenue contract research and other revenue in and included million and million  respectively  recognized in connection with our five year grant from the nih  which we were awarded in september as part of the nih s knockout mouse project 
expenses total operating expenses increased to million in from million in our average headcount in increased to from in principally as a result of our expanding research and development activities  which are primarily attributable to our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis

includes million and million of non cash compensation expense in and  respectively 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  in periods when bayer healthcare incurs vegf trap eye development expenses  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
bayer healthcare provides us with estimated vegf trap eye development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter 
bayer healthcare s estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly 
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount  as described above 
clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our clinical development programs for i vegf trap eye  including our view trial in wet amd  da vinci trial in dme  and copernicus trial in crvo  ii rilonacept  related to our phase clinical development program in gout  and iii monoclonal antibody candidates  which are in earlier stage clinical development 
clinical manufacturing costs increased due to higher costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of rilonacept and monoclonal antibodies  partially offset by lower costs related to manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies 
research and preclinical development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs 
occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount  expanded research and development activities  and new and expanded leased laboratory and office facilities in tarrytown  new york 
cost sharing of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in connection with the view trial in wet amd and the galileo trial in crvo  both of which are being conducted by bayer healthcare 
we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development  which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor  non cash compensation expense  and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects  and  under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below year ended december  increase project costs decrease in millions rilonacept vegf trap eye aflibercept regn other antibody candidates in clinical development other research programs unallocated costs total research and development expenses drug development and approval in the united states is a multi step process regulated by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation  leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which  if successful  allows the opportunity for study in humans  or clinical study  of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phases   and the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process 
following successful completion of phase clinical trials for a biological product  a biologics license application or bla must be submitted to  and accepted by  the fda  and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
we may elect either on our own  or at the request of the fda  to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase b and studies 
phase b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review 
these studies are conducted under an ind 
phase studies  also referred to as post marketing studies  are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing 
in addition  as discovery research  preclinical development  and clinical programs progress  opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge 
we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs  thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product 
for example  we  and our collaborators where applicable  continue to explore further development of rilonacept  aflibercept  and vegf trap eye in different disease indications 
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development  including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development  uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials  changes in regulatory requirements  changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate  and other risks and uncertainties described in item a  risk factors under risks related to arcalyst rilonacept and the development of our product candidates  regulatory and litigation risks  and risks related to commercialization of products 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied  the estimated cost and scope of the projects  and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
similarly  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows 
in  we received fda approval for arcalyst rilonacept for the treatment of caps  a group of rare  inherited auto inflammatory diseases that affect a very small group of people 
we shipped million and million of arcalyst to our us distributors in and  respectively 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in in  we incurred i higher compensation expense  ii higher patent related costs  iii higher facility related costs due primarily to increases in administrative headcount  and iv higher patient assistance costs related to arcalyst rilonacept 
these increases were partially offset by i lower marketing costs related to arcalyst  ii a decrease in administrative recruitment costs  and iii lower professional fees related to various corporate matters 
cost of goods sold during  we began recognizing revenue and cost of goods sold from net product sales of arcalyst 
we began capitalizing inventory costs associated with commercial supplies of arcalyst subsequent to receipt of marketing approval from the fda in february costs for manufacturing supplies of arcalyst prior to receipt of fda approval were recognized as research and development expenses in the period that the costs were incurred 
therefore  these costs are not included in cost of goods sold when revenue is recognized from the sale of those supplies of arcalyst 
cost of goods sold in and was million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of royalties and other period costs related to arcalyst commercial supplies 
other income and expense investment income decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to lower yields on  and lower balances of  cash and marketable securities 
in addition  in and  deterioration in the credit quality of specific marketable securities in our investment portfolio subjected us to the risk of not being able to recover these securities carrying values 
as a result  in and  we recognized charges of million and million  respectively  related to these securities  which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
in and  these charges were either wholly or partially offset by realized gains of million and million  respectively  on sales of marketable securities during the year 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in interest expense in was attributable to the imputed interest portion of payments to our landlord  commencing in the third quarter of  to lease newly constructed laboratory and office facilities in tarrytown  new york 
interest expense in related to million of convertible senior subordinated notes until they were retired 
during the second and third quarters of  we repurchased a total of million in principal amount of these convertible notes for million 
in connection with these repurchases  we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt  representing the premium paid on the notes plus related unamortized debt issuance costs 
the remaining million of convertible notes were repaid in full upon their maturity in october income tax benefit expense in  we recognized a million income tax benefit  consisting primarily of i million resulting from a provision in the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of that allows us to claim a refund of us federal alternative minimum tax that we paid in  as described below  and ii million resulting from a provision in the american recovery and reinvestment act of that allows us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre research tax credits 
in  we implemented a tax planning strategy which resulted in the utilization of certain net operating loss carry forwards that would otherwise have expired over the next several years  to offset income for tax purposes 
as a result  we incurred and paid income tax expense of million  which relates to us federal and new york state alternative minimum taxes and included million of interest and penalties 
this expense was partly offset by a million income tax benefit  resulting from a provision in the housing assistance tax act of that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre research tax credits 
years ended december  and net loss regeneron reported a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted for the decrease in net loss was principally due to revenues earned in in connection with our november antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis  partly offset by higher research and development expenses

in august  we entered into a separate velocigene agreement with sanofi aventis 
in  we recognized million in revenue related to this agreement 
bayer healthcare collaboration revenue the collaboration revenue we earn from bayer healthcare  as detailed below  consists of cost sharing of regeneron vegf trap eye development expenses and recognition of revenue related to a non refundable million up front payment and a million milestone payment received in august which  for the purpose of revenue recognition  was not considered substantive 
years ended december  bayer healthcare collaboration revenue in millions cost sharing of regeneron vegf trap eye development expenses recognition of deferred revenue related to up front and milestone payments total bayer healthcare collaboration revenue for the period from the collaboration s inception in october through september   all up front licensing  milestone  and cost sharing payments received or receivable from bayer healthcare had been fully deferred and included in deferred revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  we and bayer healthcare approved a global development plan for vegf trap eye in wet amd 
the plan included estimated development steps  timelines  and costs  as well as the projected responsibilities of each of the companies 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we and bayer healthcare reaffirmed the companies commitment to a dme development program and had initial estimates of development costs for vegf trap eye in dme 
as a result  effective in the fourth quarter of  the company determined the appropriate accounting policy for payments from bayer healthcare 
the million up front licensing and million milestone payments from bayer healthcare are being recognized as collaboration revenue over the related estimated performance period 
in periods when we recognize vegf trap eye development expenses that we incur under the collaboration  we also recognize  as collaboration revenue  the portion of those vegf trap eye development expenses that is reimbursable from bayer healthcare 
in periods when bayer healthcare incurs agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses that benefit the collaboration and regeneron  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced recognizing previously deferred payments from bayer healthcare and cost sharing of our and bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses through a cumulative catch up 
cost sharing of our vegf trap eye development expenses with bayer healthcare decreased in compared to under the terms of the collaboration  in  the first million of agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses incurred by regeneron and bayer healthcare under a global development plan were shared equally  and we were solely responsible for up to the next million 
since both we and bayer healthcare incurred higher vegf trap eye development expenses in compared to  during the fourth quarter of  we were solely responsible for most of the collaboration s vegf trap eye development expenses  which partly contributed to the revenue decrease in compared to in addition  the decrease was due in part to the cumulative catchup recognized in from the inception of the collaboration in october  as described above 
recognition of deferred revenue related to bayer healthcare s million up front and million milestone payments also decreased in from as a result of the cumulative catch up 
as of december   million of the up front licensing and milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
technology licensing revenue in connection with our velocimmune license agreements with astrazeneca and astellas  each of the million annual  non refundable payments are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements 
net product sales in  we recognized as revenue million of arcalyst rilonacept net product sales for which both the right of return no longer exists and rebates can be reasonably estimated 
at december   deferred revenue related to arcalyst net product sales totaled million

includes million and million of non cash compensation expense in and  respectively 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  in periods when bayer healthcare incurs vegf trap eye development expenses  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced recognizing cost sharing of our and bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses 
bayer healthcare provides us with estimated vegf trap eye development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter 
bayer healthcare s estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly 
payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount  as described above 
clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our clinical development programs for i vegf trap eye  which includes our view trial in wet amd  ii rilonacept  which includes our phase gout flare prevention clinical study  and iii monoclonal antibodies  which includes regn as well as clinical related preparatory activities for regn clinical manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher expenses related to vegf trap eye and monoclonal antibodies  including regn these increases were partially offset by a reduction in manufacturing costs associated with rilonacept and aflibercept 
research and preclinical development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs 
occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount and expanded research and development activities 
cost sharing of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in connection with the view trial in wet amd  which bayer healthcare initiated in we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development  which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor  non cash compensation expense  and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects  and  under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  the portion of bayer healthcare s vegf trap eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below year ended december  increase project costs decrease in millions rilonacept aflibercept vegf trap eye regn other research programs unallocated costs total research and development expenses for the reasons described above in results of operations for the years ended december  and  under the caption research and development expenses  and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied  the estimated cost and scope of the projects  and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
similarly  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows 
in the first quarter of  we received fda approval for arcalyst rilonacept for the treatment of caps  a group of rare  inherited auto inflammatory diseases 
these rare diseases affect a very small group of people 
we shipped million of arcalyst to our us distributors in selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in in  we incurred million of selling expenses related to arcalyst for the treatment of caps 
general and administrative expenses increased in due to i higher compensation expense primarily resulting from increases in administrative headcount to support our expanded research and development activities  ii higher recruitment and related costs associated with expanding our headcount  iii higher fees for professional services related to various general corporate matters  and iv higher administrative facility related costs 
cost of goods sold during  we began recognizing revenue and cost of goods sold from net product sales of arcalyst 
we began capitalizing inventory costs associated with commercial supplies of arcalyst subsequent to receipt of marketing approval from the fda in february costs for manufacturing supplies of arcalyst prior to receipt of fda approval were recognized as research and development expenses in the period that the costs were incurred 
therefore  these costs are not being included in cost of goods sold when revenue is recognized from the sale of those supplies of arcalyst 
cost of goods sold in was million and consisted primarily of royalties and other period costs related to arcalyst commercial supplies 
other income and expense investment income decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to lower yields on our cash and marketable securities 
in addition  in and  deterioration in the credit quality of specific marketable securities in our investment portfolio subjected us to the risk of not being able to recover these securities carrying values 
as a result  in and  we recognized charges of million and million  respectively  related to these securities  which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
in  these charges were partially offset by realized gains of million on sales of marketable securities during the year 
interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  was attributable to our convertible senior subordinated notes due october  during the second and third quarters of  we repurchased a total of million in principal amount of these convertible notes for million 
in connection with these repurchases  we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt  representing the premium paid on the notes plus related unamortized debt issuance costs 
the remaining million of convertible notes were repaid in full upon their maturity in october income tax expense in the third quarter of  we implemented a tax planning strategy which resulted in the utilization of certain net operating loss carry forwards  that would otherwise have expired over the next several years  to offset income for tax purposes 
as a result  we incurred and paid income tax expense of million  which relates to us federal and new york state alternative minimum taxes and included million of interest and penalties 
this expense was partially offset by a million income tax benefit  resulting from a provision in the housing assistance tax act of that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre research tax credits 
revision of previously issued financial statements the application of fasb authoritative guidance  under certain conditions  can result in the capitalization on a lessee s books of a lessor s costs of constructing facilities to be leased to the lessee 
in mid  we became aware that certain of these conditions were applicable to our december lease  as amended  of new laboratory and office facilities in tarrytown  new york 
as a result  we are deemed  in substance  to be the owner of the landlord s buildings  and the landlord s costs of constructing these new facilities were required to be capitalized on our books as a non cash transaction  offset by a corresponding lease obligation on our balance sheet 
in addition  the land element of the lease should have been accounted for as an operating lease  therefore  adjustments to non cash rent expense previously recognized in connection with these new facilities were also required 
lease payments on these facilities commenced in august we revised our previously issued financial statements to capitalize the landlord s costs of constructing the new tarrytown facilities which we are leasing and to adjust our previously recognized rent expense in connection with these facilities  as described above 
these revisions primarily resulted in an increase to property  plant  and equipment and a corresponding increase in facility lease obligation a long term liability at each balance sheet date 
we also revised our statements of operations and statements of cash flows to reflect rent expense in connection with only the land element of our lease  with a corresponding adjustment to other long term liabilities 
as previously disclosed in our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended june and september   the above described revisions consisted entirely of non cash adjustments 
they had no impact on our business operations  existing capital resources  or our ability to fund our operating needs  including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
the revisions also had no impact on our previously reported net increases or decreases in cash and cash equivalents in any period and  except for the quarter ended march   had no impact on our previously reported net cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
in addition  these revisions had no impact on our previously reported current assets  current liabilities  and operating revenues 
we have not amended previously issued financial statements because  after considering both qualitative and quantitative factors  we determined that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on our previously issued financial statements would not have been changed or influenced by these revisions

accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities increased million at december   compared to end of year  primarily in connection with our expanded levels of activities and expenditures  including higher liabilities for clinical related expenses  which were partially offset by an million decrease in the cost sharing payment due to bayer healthcare in connection with our vegf trap eye collaboration 
at december   accounts receivable increased by million  compared to end of year  primarily due to a higher receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
our deferred revenue balances at december  decreased by million  compared to end of year  primarily due to the amortization of previously received deferred payments under our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
this decrease was partially offset by the deferral of million of arcalyst rilonacept net product sales at december  at december   accounts receivable increased by million  compared to end of year  due to higher receivable balances related to our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
also  prepaid expenses and other assets increased million at december   compared to end of year  due primarily to higher prepaid clinical trial costs 
our deferred revenue balances at december  increased by million  compared to end of year  due primarily to i the million up front payment received from sanofi aventis  ii the million milestone payment from bayer healthcare which was not considered to be substantive for revenue recognition purposes and  therefore  fully deferred  and iii the two million licensing payments received from each of astrazeneca and astellas  all as described above  partly offset by revenue recognition  principally from amortization of these deferred payments and prior year deferred payments from sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities increased million at december   compared to end of year  primarily due to a million cost sharing payment due to bayer healthcare in connection with the companies vegf trap eye collaboration and higher accruals in for payroll costs and clinical related expenses 
the majority of our cash expenditures in   and were to fund research and development  primarily related to our clinical programs and our preclinical human monoclonal antibody programs

in the second and third quarters of  we repurchased million in principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes for million 
the remaining million of convertible notes were repaid in full upon their maturity in october in  sanofi aventis purchased million newly issued  unregistered shares of our common stock for gross proceeds to us of million 
in addition  proceeds from issuances of common stock in connection with exercises of employee stock options were million in  million in  and million in fair value of marketable securities at december  and  we held marketable securities whose aggregate fair value totaled million and million  respectively 
the composition of our portfolio of marketable securities on these dates was as follows investment type fair value percent fair value percent us treasury securities us government agency securities us government guaranteed corporate bonds us government guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations corporate bonds mortgage backed securities other asset backed securities other total marketable securities in addition  at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash  primarily held in money market funds that invest in us government securities 
during  as marketable securities in our portfolio matured or paid down  we purchased primarily us treasury securities  us government agency obligations  and us government guaranteed debt 
this shift toward higher quality securities  which we initiated in  reduced the risk profile  as well as the overall yield  of our portfolio during in particular  we reduced the proportion of mortgage backed securities in  and eliminated other asset backed securities from  the portfolio since they had deteriorated in credit quality and declined in value due to higher delinquency rates on the underlying collateral supporting these securities 
the mortgage backed securities that we held at december  are backed by prime and sub prime residential mortgages and home equity loans 
the estimated fair value of our mortgage backed securities generally ranged from to of par value at december  our mortgage backed securities are all senior tranches that are paid down before other subordinated tranches as the loans in the underlying collateral are repaid 
through december   we continued to receive monthly payments of principal and interest on our mortgage backed securities holdings 
if the monthly principal and interest payments continue at approximately the current rate  we anticipate that all of the mortgage backed securities in our portfolio will be repaid within the next two years  and most would be repaid in however  higher delinquency rates in the underlying collateral supporting mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio could result in future impairment charges related to these securities  which could be material 
we classify our investments using a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the three tiers are level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
changes in level marketable securities during the year ended december  and were as follows level marketable securities in millions balance january settlements realized gain impairments balance december during the years ended december  and  there were no transfers of marketable securities between level and level classifications 
our methods for valuing our marketable securities are described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
with respect to valuations for pricing our level marketable securities  we consider quantitative and qualitative factors such as financial conditions and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of investment advisors  and forecasts of economic  market  or industry trends 
for valuations that we determine for our level marketable securities  we regularly monitor these securities and adjust their valuations as deemed appropriate based on the facts and circumstances

lease tarrytown  new york facilities we lease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space at facilities in tarrytown  new york  under a december lease agreement  as amended 
these facilities include approximately  square feet of newly constructed space in two new buildings buildings a and b that were completed during the third quarter of and  under a december amendment to the lease  approximately  square feet of additional new space that is under construction in a third new building building c  which is expected to be completed in mid the lease will expire in june and contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each  as well as early termination options on approximately  square feet of space 
the lease provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for utilities  taxes  and operating expenses 
certain premises under the lease are accounted for as operating leases 
however  for the newly constructed space that we are leasing  we are deemed  in substance  to be the owner of the landlord s buildings in accordance with the application of fasb authoritative guidance as described above under revision of previously issued financial statements  and the landlord s costs of constructing these new facilities are required to be capitalized on our books as a non cash transaction  offset by a corresponding lease obligation on our balance sheet 
in connection with the lease  in december  we issued a letter of credit in the amount of million to our landlord  which is collateralized by a million bank certificate of deposit 
in connection with buildings a and b  we capitalized our landlord s costs of constructing these new facilities  which totaled million as of december   and recognized a corresponding facility lease obligation of million 
we also recognized  as an additional facility lease obligation  reimbursements totaling million from our landlord during for tenant improvement costs that we incurred since  under fasb authoritative guidance  these reimbursements from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation 
monthly lease payments on these facilities are allocated between the land element of the lease which is accounted for as an operating lease and the facility lease obligation  based on the estimated relative fair values of the land and buildings 
the imputed interest rate applicable to the facility lease obligation is approximately 
at december  and  the facility lease obligation balance in connection with these new facilities was million and million  respectively 
in addition  as described above  we amended our lease in december to include additional new laboratory and office space in building c that is under construction 
as of december   we capitalized million of our landlord s costs of constructing these new facilities  and recognized a corresponding facility lease obligation of million 
monthly lease payments on these facilities will commence in january and additional charges for utilities  taxes  and operating expenses commenced in january rent expense in connection with the land element of these additional facilities  which is accounted for as an operating lease  commenced in december and is recorded as a deferred liability until lease payments commence in january in addition  interest expense is imputed at a rate of approximately  and is capitalized and deferred in connection with this facility lease obligation 
at december   the facility lease obligation balance in connection with these additional new facilities was million 
capital expenditures our cash expenditures for property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  million in  and million in as described above  million of tenant improvement costs we incurred in tarrytown were reimbursed by our landlord in we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately to million in and approximately to million in  primarily in connection with expanding our rensselaer  new york manufacturing facilities and tenant improvements at our newly leased tarrytown facilities in building c 
in february  we received million from our landlord in connection with tenant improvement costs in tarrytown 
we also expect to be reimbursed for a portion of the capital expenditures for our rensselaer facilities by sanofi aventis  with the remaining amount to be funded by our existing capital resources 
funding requirements our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately billion 
we have entered into various agreements related to our activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms  including collaboration agreements  such as those with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  and agreements to use our velocigene technology platform 
we incurred expenses associated with these agreements  which include reimbursable and non reimbursable amounts  an allocable portion of general and administrative costs  and cost sharing of a collaborator s development expenses  where applicable  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements primarily for research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing 
before taking into account reimbursements from our collaborators  and exclusive of anticipated funding for capital expenditures as described above  we currently anticipate that approximately of our expenditures for will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates  including rilonacept  aflibercept  vegf trap eye  and clinical stage monoclonal antibodies  approximately of our expenditures for will be applied to our basic research and early preclinical activities  and the remainder of our expenditures for will be used for the continued development of our novel technology platforms and general corporate purposes 
while we expect that funding requirements for our research and development activities will continue to increase in  we also expect that a greater proportion of our research and development expenditures will be reimbursed by our collaborators  especially in connection with our amended and expanded antibody collaboration with sanofi aventis 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  these obligations and commitments assume non termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change payments due by period less than greater than total one year to years to years years in millions operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations excludes future contingent costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses included in our rent 
in  these costs were million 
see note a to our financial statements 
purchase obligations primarily relate to i research and development commitments  including those related to clinical trials  ii capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions  and iii license payments 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events 
open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above 
represents payments with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above 
see note a to our financial statements 
as described above  in february  we received million from our landlord in connection with tenant improvement costs in tarrytown 
as a result  total contractual obligations  as detailed in the table above  will increase i from million to million for the year ending december   ii from million to million for the two year period beginning january   iii from million to million for the two year period beginning january   and iv from million to million for the fiscal years beginning january  and thereafter 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  over the next several years we and bayer healthcare will share agreed upon vegf trap eye development expenses incurred by both companies  under a global development plan  as described above 
in addition  under our collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable  we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare for a defined percentage generally of agreed upon development expenses incurred by sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare  respectively 
profitability under each collaboration will be measured by calculating net sales less agreed upon expenses 
these reimbursements would be deducted from our share of the collaboration profits and  for our aflibercept collaboration with sanofi aventis  royalties on product sales in japan otherwise payable to us unless we agree to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate at our option 
given the uncertainties related to drug development including the development of aflibercept and co developed antibody candidates in collaboration with sanofi aventis and vegf trap eye in collaboration with bayer healthcare such as the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate and the ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  we are currently unable to reliably estimate if our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare will become profitable 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of our collaborations with sanofi aventis and bayer healthcare 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  and for supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
currently  we are required to remit royalties on product sales of arcalyst rilonacept for the treatment of caps 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell arcalyst for other indications or certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will continue to be substantial 
we believe that our existing capital resources  including funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements  will enable us to meet operating needs through at least however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
for example  if we choose to commercialize products that are not licensed to a third party  we could incur substantial pre marketing and commercialization expenses that could lead us to consume our cash at a faster rate 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we would expect to prioritize available capital to fund selected preclinical and clinical development programs or license selected products 
other than our operating leases and a million letter of credit issued to our landlord in connection with our lease for facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in the event we need additional financing for the operation of our business  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could materially harm our business 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb amended its authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the amended guidance provides greater ability to separate and allocate arrangement consideration in a multiple element revenue arrangement by requiring the use of estimated selling prices to allocate arrangement consideration  thereby eliminating the use of the residual method of allocation 
the amended guidance also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures surrounding multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
we are required to adopt this amended guidance effective for the fiscal year beginning january   although earlier adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates principally in connection with our investment of excess cash in direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities and  to a lesser extent  investment grade debt securities issued by corporations  bank deposits  and asset backed securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimate that a one percent unfavorable change in interest rates would have resulted in approximately a million and million decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
credit quality risk we have an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities  minimum credit quality  maturity parameters  and concentration and diversification 
nonetheless  deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security 
we have recognized other than temporary impairment charges related to certain marketable securities of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the current economic environment and the deterioration in the credit quality of issuers of securities that we hold increase the risk of potential declines in the current market value of marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
such declines could result in charges against income in future periods for other than temporary impairments and the amounts could be material
