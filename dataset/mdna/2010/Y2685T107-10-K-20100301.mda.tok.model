item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a marshall islands company incorporated in september to transport iron ore  coal  grain  steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels 
as of february   our fleet consisted of nine capesize  eight panamax  four supramax  six handymax and eight handysize drybulk carriers  with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately  dwt  and the average age of our fleet was approximately years at december   as compared to the average age for the world fleet of approximately years for the drybulk shipping segments in which we compete 
most of the vessels in our fleet are on time charters to well known charterers  including lauritzen bulkers  cargill  pacbasin  stx  cosco  and hmmc 
as of february   of the vessels in our fleet are presently engaged under time charter contracts that expire assuming the option periods in the time charters are not exercised between march and october  and six of our vessels are currently operating in vessel pools 
see page for a table indicating the delivery dates of all vessels currently in our fleet 
we intend to acquire additional modern  high quality drybulk carriers through timely and selective acquisitions of vessels in a manner that is accretive to our cash flow 
we expect to fund acquisitions of additional vessels using cash reserves set aside for this purpose  additional borrowings and may consider additional debt and equity financing alternatives from time to time 
our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet 
commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels  managing the mix of various types of charters  such as time charters and voyage charters  and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters 
strategic management includes locating  purchasing  financing and selling vessels 
we currently contract with three independent technical managers  to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in house 
technical management involves the day to day management of vessels  including performing routine maintenance  attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies 
members of our new york city based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers 
on october   baltic trading  our wholly owned subsidiary  filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  or sec

ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period 
we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels 
companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues 
we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to unforeseen circumstances 
the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues 
we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
we define tce rates as net voyage revenue voyage revenues less voyage expenses divided by the number of our available days during the period  which is consistent with industry standards 
tce rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters  because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts

for  revenues decreased to million versus million for revenues in both periods consisted of charter payments for our vessels  including revenue realized from pools 
the decrease in revenues during the twelve months ended december  was due to lower charter rates achieved for some of our vessels  reflecting the generally lower rates for charters entered into in current market conditions  offset by additional revenue from the operation of a larger fleet 
the average tce rate of our fleet decreased to  a day for from  a day for the decrease in tce rates was primarily due to lower time charter rates achieved in versus the prior year for six of our panamax vessels  three of our supramax vessels  two of our handymax vessels  as well as six of our handysize vessels in our current fleet 
additionally  there were lower revenues for two of our capesize vessels due to profit sharing agreements 
this was offset by higher revenues on two of our panamax vessels and four of our handymax vessels 
furthermore  the overall decrease in the average tce rate of our fleet during was offset by revenue earned due to the operation of three of the capesize vessels acquired as part of the metrostar acquisition  the genco hadrian  genco commodus and genco maximus

port and canal charges and bunker expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessel owner 
for the years ended and  we did not incur port and canal charges or any significant expenses related to the consumption of bunkers as part of our vessels overall expenses  because all of our vessels were employed under time charters or pool arrangements that required the charterer to bear all of those expenses

our vessel operating expenses  which generally represent fixed costs  will increase as a result of the expansion of our fleet 
other factors beyond our control  some of which may affect the shipping industry in general  including  for instance  developments relating to market prices for crewing  lubes  and insurance  may also cause these expenses to increase

depreciation and amortization we depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel 
depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value 
we estimate the useful life of our vessels to be years 
furthermore  we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be based upon per lightweight ton  which we believe to be the anticipated scrap value of our vessels 
for years ended december  and  depreciation and amortization charges were million and million  respectively  resulting in an increase of million 
the increase primarily was due to the operation of a larger fleet 
loss on forfeiture of vessel deposits for year ended december  and  the loss on forfeiture of vessel deposits was million and million  respectively

on june   we entered into an amendment to the credit facility allowing us to prepay vessel deposits to give us flexibility in refinancing potential vessel acquisitions 
due to refinancing of our previous facilities  we incurred a non cash write off of the unamortized deferred financing cost in the amount of million associated with our previous facilities and this charge was reflected in interest expense in the third quarter of due to refinancing of the credit facility as a result of entering into the amendment  we incurred a non cash write off of unamortized deferred financing cost in the amount of million associated with capitalized costs related to prior amendments  and this charge was reflected in interest expense in the fourth quarter of short term line refinanced by the credit facility on may   we entered into a short term line of credit facility under which dnb nor bank asa  grand cayman branch and nordea bank norge asa  grand cayman branch are serving as lenders the short term line 
the short term line was used to fund a portion of acquisitions we made of in the shares of capital stock of jinhui

the short term line incorporated by reference certain covenants from our credit facility 
the short term line was refinanced in july by the credit facility

interest rate swap agreements  forward freight agreements and currency swap agreements at december   we have ten interest rate swap agreements with dnb nor bank to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
the total notional principal amount of the swaps is million and the swaps have specified rates and durations 
refer to the table in note long term debt of our financial statements  which summarizes the interest rate swaps in place as of december  and we have considered the creditworthiness of both ourselves and the counterparty in determining the fair value of the interest rate derivatives  and such consideration resulted in an immaterial adjustment to the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet 
valuations prior to any adjustments for credit risk are validated by comparison with counterparty valuations 
amounts are not and should not be identical due to the different modeling assumptions 
any material differences are investigated 
we had entered into a number of short term forward currency contracts to protect ourselves from the risk associated with the fluctuation in the exchange rate associated with the cost basis of the jinhui shares as described below in note investment of our financial statements 
as forward contracts expired  we continued to enter into new forward currency contracts for the cost basis of the investment  excluding commissions 
however  hedge accounting is limited to the lower of the cost basis or the market value at time of designation 
we elected to discontinue the forward currency contracts as of october  due to the declining underlying market value of jinhui 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into arrangements commonly known as forward freight agreements  or ffas  to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
these arrangements may include future contracts  or commitments to perform in the future a shipping service between ship owners  charters and traders 
generally  these arrangements would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified tonnage freighting commitment forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
although ffas can be entered into for a variety of purposes  including for hedging  as an option  for trading or for arbitrage  if we decided to enter into ffas  our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
it is not currently our intention to enter into ffas to generate a stream of income independent of the revenues we derive from the operation of our fleet of vessels 
if we determine to enter into ffas  we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns  but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market 
we have not entered into any ffas as of december interest rates the effective interest rate associated with the interest expense for the credit facility  as amended  including the rate differential between the pay fixed receive variable rate on the swaps that were in effect  combined  including the cost associated with unused commitment fees with these facilities for was

following the execution of the agreements as noted in above  baltic trading paid cumulative deposits totaling million during february to the aforementioned unaffiliated parties using funds advanced by the company 
interest expense has been estimated using the fixed hedge rate for the effective period and notional amount of the debt which is effectively hedged and for the portion of the debt that has no designated swap against it  plus the applicable bank margin of 
we are obligated to pay certain commitment fees in connection with the credit facility  which have been reflected within interest and borrowing fees 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions 
our fleet currently consists of nine capesize drybulk carriers  eight panamax drybulk carriers  four supramax drybulk carriers  six handymax drybulk carriers and eight handysize drybulk carriers 
in addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods  we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings 
we estimate our drydocking costs and scheduled off hire days for our fleet through to be estimated drydocking cost estimated offhire days us dollars in millions year the costs reflected are estimates based on drydocking our vessels in china 
we estimate that each drydock will result in days of off hire 
actual costs will vary based on various factors  including where the drydockings are actually performed 
one of our capesize drybulk carriers that is drydocking during is anticipated to complete the required maintenance in only ten days 
we expect to fund these costs with cash from operations 
during  we incurred a total of million of drydocking costs 
during  we incurred a total of million of drydocking costs 
we estimate that nine of our vessels will be drydocked during and an additional five vessels in off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
inflation inflation has only a moderate effect on our expenses given current economic conditions 
in the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear  these pressures would increase our operating  voyage  general and administrative  and financing costs 
however  we expect our costs to increase based on the anticipated increased cost for repairs and maintenance and lubricants 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
for an additional description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this k 
vessel acquisitions when we enter into an acquisition transaction  we determine whether the acquisition transaction was the purchase of an asset or a business based on the facts and circumstances of the transaction 
as is customary in the shipping industry  the purchase of a vessel is normally treated as a purchase of an asset as the historical operating data for the vessel is not reviewed nor is material to our decision to make such acquisition 
when a vessel is acquired with an existing time charter  we allocate the purchase price of the vessel and the time charter based on  among other things  vessel market valuations and the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired charters of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the charter terms and ii management s estimate of the fair market charter rate  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the charter 
the capitalized above market assets and below market liabilities charters are amortized as a reduction or increase  respectively  to voyage revenues over the remaining term of the charter 
revenue and voyage expense recognition revenues are generated from time charter agreements and pool agreements 
a time charter involves placing a vessel at the charterer s disposal for a set period of time during which the charterer may use the vessel in return for the payment by the charterer of a specified daily hire rate 
in time charters  operating costs including crews  maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and specified voyage costs such as fuel and port charges are paid by the charterer 
there are certain other non specified voyage expenses such as commissions which are borne by the company 
we record time charter revenues over the term of the charter as service is provided 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis as the average revenue over the term of the respective time charter agreement 
we recognize vessel operating expenses when incurred 
three of our vessels  the genco constantine  genco titus and genco hadrian  are chartered under time charters which include a profit sharing element 
under these charter agreements  we receive a fixed rate of   and  per day  respectively  and an additional profit sharing payment 
the profit sharing between us and the respective charterer for each day period is calculated by taking the average over that period of the published baltic cape index of the four time charter routes as reflected in daily reports 
if such average is more than the base rate payable under the charter  the excess amount is allocable to us and to the charterer 
a commission of based on the profit sharing amount due to us is incurred out of our share 
profit sharing revenue is recorded when the average of the published baltic cape index for the four time charter routes is available for the entire day period  which is when the profit sharing revenue is fixed and determinable 
at december   seven of our vessels are in vessel pools  six of these are earning variable rates and one is earning a fixed rate based on our option to convert to a fixed rate 
the genco predator entered into the bulkhandling handymax pool in november  the genco leader entered into the baumarine pool during december and the genco explorer  genco pioneer  genco progress  genco reliance and genco sugar entered the lauritzen pool during august vessel pools  such as the bulkhandling handymax pool  baumarine pool and the lauritzen pool  provide cost effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels 
the pool arrangement provides the benefits of a large scale operation  and chartering efficiencies that might not be available to smaller fleets 
under the pool arrangement  the vessels operate under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the pool and operating costs including crews  maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel 
since the members of the pool share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool  and the pool operates in the spot market  the revenue earned by these vessels is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market 
we recognize revenue from these pool arrangements based on the net distributions reported by the applicable pool 
due from charterers  net due from charterers  net includes accounts receivable from charters  net of the provision for doubtful accounts 
at each balance sheet date  we provide for the provision based on a review of all outstanding charter receivables 
included in the standard time charter contracts with our customers are certain performance parameters  which if not met can result in customer claims 
as of december   we had a reserve of million against due from charterers balance and an additional accrual of million in deferred revenue  each of which is associated with estimated customer claims against us including vessel performance issues under time charter agreements 
as of december   we had a reserve of million against due from charterers balance and an additional accrual of million in deferred revenue  each of which is associated with estimated customer claims against us  including time charter performance issues 
revenue is based on contracted charterparties 
however  there is always the possibility of dispute over terms and payment of hires and freights 
in particular  disagreements may arise as to the responsibility of lost time and revenue due to us as a result 
accordingly  we periodically assess the recoverability of amounts outstanding and estimates a provision if there is a possibility of non recoverability 
although we believe its provisions to be reasonable at the time they are made  it is possible that an amount under dispute is not ultimately recovered and the estimated provision for doubtful accounts is inadequate 
depreciation we record the value of our vessels at their cost which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our drybulk vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value 
we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be based upon per lightweight ton 
an increase in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
a decrease in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  we will adjust the vessel s useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel s further commercial use 
deferred drydocking costs our vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every to months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating 
we defer the costs associated with drydockings as they occur and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings 
deferred drydocking costs include actual costs incurred at the drydock yard  cost of travel  lodging and subsistence of our personnel sent to the drydocking site to supervise  and the cost of hiring a third party to oversee the drydocking 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with us gaap guidelines and industry practice and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the vessels 
costs that are not related to drydocking are expensed as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we follow the accounting standards codification asc subtopic  property  plant and equipment asc formerly financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
if indicators of impairment are present  we would evaluate the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  by performing an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including anticipated future charter rates  estimated scrap values  future drydocking costs and estimated vessel operating costs  are included in this analysis 
investments we hold an investment in the capital stock of jinhui shipping and transportation limited jinhui 
jinhui is a drybulk shipping owner and operator focused on the supramax segment of drybulk shipping 
this investment is designated as available for sale and is reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in shareholders equity as a component of oci 
the company classifies the investment as a current or noncurrent asset based on the company s intent to hold the investment at each reporting date 
effective august   the company elected hedge accounting for forward currency contracts in place associated with the cost basis of the jinhui shares and therefore the unrealized currency gain or loss associated with jinhui cost basis is reflected in the income statement as a component of other expense to off set the gain or loss associated with these forward currency contracts 
on october   the company elected to discontinue the purchase of forward currency contracts associated with jinhui by entering into an offsetting trade that closed the previously opened currency contract  thereby eliminating the hedge on jinhui 
the cost of securities when sold is based on the specific identification method 
realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities will be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in other expense 
additionally  the realized gain or loss on the forward currency contracts is reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as an investing activity and is reflected in the caption payments on forward currency contracts  net 
investments are reviewed quarterly to identify possible other than temporary impairment in accordance asc subtopic  investments debt and equity securities asc formerly fasb staff position  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
when evaluating the investments  we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below the cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  the underlying net asset value of the issuers assets and liabilities  and the our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value should the decline in the value of any investment be deemed to be other than temporary  the investment basis would be written down to fair market value  and the write down would be recorded to earnings as a loss 
investments that are not expected to be sold within the next year are classified as noncurrent 
during the fourth quarter of  our investment in jinhui was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired due to the severity of the decline in its market value versus our cost basis 
we recorded a million impairment loss during which was reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement 
we will continue to evaluate the investment on a quarterly basis to determine the likelihood of any further significant adverse effects on the fair value and amount of any additional impairments 
in the event we determine that the jinhui investment is subject to any additional other than temporary impairment  the amount of the impairment would be reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement for the amount of the impairment 
income taxes pursuant to section of the us internal revenue code of as amended the code  qualified income derived from the international operations of ships is excluded from gross income and exempt from us federal income tax if a company engaged in the international operation of ships meets certain requirements 
among other things  in order to qualify  a company must be incorporated in a country which grants an equivalent exemption to us corporations and must satisfy certain qualified ownership requirements 
we are incorporated in the marshall islands 
pursuant to the income tax laws of the marshall islands  we are not subject to marshall islands income tax 
the marshall islands has been officially recognized by the internal revenue service as a qualified foreign country that currently grants the requisite equivalent exemption from tax 
based on the publicly traded requirement of the section regulations  we believe that we qualified for exemption from income tax for  and in order to meet the publicly traded requirement  our stock must be treated as being primarily and regularly traded for more than half the days of any such year 
under the section regulations  our qualification for the publicly traded requirement may be jeopardized if shareholders of our common stock that own five percent or more of our stock shareholders own  in the aggregate  or more of our common stock for more than half the days of the year 
we believe that during  and  the combined ownership of our shareholders did not equal or more of our common stock for more than half the days of  and however if our shareholders were to increase their ownership to or more of our common stock for more than half the days of or any future taxable year  we would not be eligible to claim exemption from tax under section for that taxable year 
we can therefore give no assurance that changes and shifts in the ownership of our stock by shareholders will not preclude us from qualifying for exemption from tax in or in future years 
if the company does not qualify for the exemption from tax under section  it would be subject to a tax on the gross shipping income without the allowance for any deductions that is treated as derived from sources within the united states or united states source shipping income 
for these purposes  shipping income means any income that is derived from the use of vessels  from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use  or from the performance of services directly related to those uses  and united states source shipping income includes of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends  but that does not both begin and end  in the united states 
baltic trading is also incorporated in the marshall islands 
pursuant to the income tax laws of the marshall islands  the company is not subject to marshall islands income tax 
baltic trading has no united states operations and no united states source income 
thus  baltic trading is not currently subject to income tax in the united states 
however  we anticipate that baltic trading will not qualify for an exemption under section upon consummation of initial public offering because it will not satisfy the publicly traded requirement described above 
the company plans to indirectly own shares of baltic trading s class b stock  which will not be publicly traded but which will provide the company with over of the combined voting power of all classes of baltic trading s voting stock 
holders of a majority of the class b stock can irrevocably elect to reduce the voting power of the class b stock to constitute not more than of the total voting power of all classes of stock  although there can be no assurance that this election will be made 
fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair values of our financial instruments such as amounts due to due from charterers  accounts payable and long term debt approximate their individual carrying amounts as of december  and december  due to their short term maturity or the variable rate nature of the respective borrowings under the credit facility

these borrowings are subject to a variable borrowing rate 
we use pay fixed receive variable interest rate swaps to manage future interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rate obligations 
these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of future variable rate interest payments and are tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis 
the differential to be paid or received for the effectively hedged portion of any swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred 
additionally  the changes in value for the portion of the swaps that are effectively hedging future interest payments are reflected as a component of oci

currency risk management we currently hold an investment in jinhui shares that are traded on the oslo stock exchange located in norway  and as such  the company is exposed to the impact of exchange rate changes on this available for sale afs security denominated in norwegian kroner 
our objective is to manage the impact of exchange rate changes on its earnings and cash flows in relation to its cost basis associated with its investments 
we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to protect its original investment from changing exchange rates through october  when the use of these contracts was discontinued due to the decline in the underlying value of jinhui 
the change in the value of the forward currency contracts is recognized as other expense and is listed as a component of other expense income 
effective august   we elected to utilize fair value hedge accounting for these instruments whereby the change in the value in the forward contracts continues to be recognized as other expense and is listed as a component of other expense income 
fair value hedge accounting then accelerates the recognition of the effective portion of the currency translation gain or loss on the afs security from august  from oci into other expense and is listed as a component of other expense income 
time value of the forward contracts is excluded from effectiveness testing and recognized currently in income
