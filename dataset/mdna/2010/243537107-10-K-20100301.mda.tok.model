overview we are a leading designer  producer  marketer  and brand manager of innovative  high quality footwear and accessories 
we market our products primarily under three proprietary brands ugg premier brand in luxury and comfort footwear and accessories  
table of contents teva high performance sport shoes and rugged outdoor footwear  and simple innovative sustainable lifestyle footwear and accessories 
in addition to our primary brands  our other brands include tsubo  a line of high end casual footwear that incorporates style  function and maximum comfort  and ahnu  a line of outdoor performance and lifestyle footwear 
we sell our brands through our quality domestic retailers and international distributors and retailers  as well as directly to our end user consumers through our ecommerce business and our retail stores 
independent third parties manufacture all of our products 
our business has been impacted by several important trends affecting our end markets recent changes in us and global economic conditions have adversely impacted businesses generally 
some of our customers have been  and more may be  adversely affected 
this in turn has  and may continue to  adversely impact our financial results 
the markets for casual  outdoor and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade 
we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace  increasingly active outdoor lifestyles and a growing emphasis on comfort 
consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality  comfort and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear 
our customers have narrowed their footwear product breadth  focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market category creators and leaders 
consumers have become increasingly focused on luxury and comfort  seeking out products and brands that are fashionable while still comfortable 
there is an emerging sustainable lifestyle movement happening all around the world 
consumers are demanding that brands and companies take a more responsible approach when it comes to protecting the environment 
by emphasizing our brands images and our focus on comfort  performance and authenticity  we believe we can maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences 
below is an overview of the various components of our business  including some of the important factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business 
ugg brand overview the ugg brand has become well known throughout the us as well as internationally 
over the past several years  our ugg brand has received increased media exposure including increased print media in national ads and cooperative advertising with our customers  which has contributed to broader public awareness of the brand and significantly increased demand for the diverse categories within the brand 
we believe that the increased media focus and demand for ugg products were driven by the following consumer brand loyalty  due to the luxury and comfort of ugg footwear and accessories  increased marketing in high end magazines  successful targeting of high end distribution  adoption by high profile film and television celebrities as a favored brand  
table of contents increased media attention that has enabled us to introduce the brand to consumers much faster than we would have otherwise been able to  increased exposure to the brand driven by our retail concept stores which showcase all of our product offerings  continued geographic expansion across the us and internationally  and continued innovation of new product categories and styles 
we believe the luxury and comfort features of ugg products will continue to drive long term consumer demand 
recognizing that there is a significant fashion element to ugg footwear and that footwear fashions fluctuate  our strategy seeks to prolong the longevity of the brand by offering a broader product line suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and by limiting distribution to selected higher end retailers 
as part of this strategy we have increased our product offering  including a growing spring line  an expanded men s line  and a fall line that consists of a range of luxurious collections for both genders  an expanded kid s line  as well as handbags and cold weather outerwear and accessories 
teva brand overview though participation in many traditional outdoor recreational activities is on the decline  we continue to see consumer preferences shifting towards an outdoor lifestyle and to outdoor activities that can be done in a day  an afternoon  or even an hour 
because of our teva brand s heritage in outdoor footwear as well as our continued commitment to product innovation  the brand remains popular with traditional outdoor athletes and enthusiasts 
although sales were lower than  the teva brand held up through the economic downturn 
while our first true fall line  which debuted in  had solid sell in  weaker than expected sell through exposed a lack of direction in development of the product line 
the teva product line now includes a broad range of performance and lifestyle products and price points  both open and closed toe footwear  appropriate for all seasons  for men  women and children 
we see continuing opportunity to grow the teva brand within our core outdoor specialty and sporting goods channels of trade 
we also believe there are expansion opportunities into the family footwear  department store  and better footwear channels 
through effective channel management and clear product line segmentation  we believe we can grow the teva brand in all of these channels without alienating our core consumer or retailers in the outdoor specialty channel 
however  we cannot assure investors that these efforts will be successful 
simple brand overview the simple brand is committed to style and innovation in fashionable  youthful  functional  and sustainably produced footwear and accessories 
the brand is a leader in sustainable footwear and accessories  and we feel that how we make simple products is just as important as why we make them 
that means our goal is to find more sustainable and innovative ways of doing business 
we are committed to our goal of making simple products sustainable  thus minimizing the ecological footprint left on the planet 
green toe  our collection of sustainable footwear  represents a revolutionary shift in thinking about footwear by building a shoe from the inside out using sustainable materials and processes 
the progress in green toe has influenced the rest of the simple product line  which has led to the development of additional product platforms  such as ecosneaks 
this product collection also uses sustainable materials such as water based cements  certified organic cotton  british leather consortium blc and international standards organization iso leathers  hemp  and outsoles made from recycled car tires 
we promote our simple brand by emphasizing that we make fashionable  youthful  functional and sustainable footwear 
our goal for the simple brand is to engage the consumer through all communication vehicles and to show people that sustainability is an emerging lifestyle for everyone  not just environmentally conscious individuals 
our marketing vehicles include small print in regional 
table of contents publications  a digital media platform  including a social media strategy  public relations and consumer events that focus on music and sustainability

ahnu products are sold throughout the us  primarily at outdoor specialty stores and independent shoe stores  as well as certain regions internationally 
we believe that the tsubo and ahnu brands complement our existing portfolio of lifestyle brands  and that the tsubo and ahnu brands target consumer  product selection  industry niche and relative under penetration in the marketplace make these brands a good fit for us 
we expect to leverage our design  marketing and distribution capabilities to grow these brands over the next several years  consistent with our mission to build niche brands into global market leaders

net sales of our retail store business  which are predominantly ugg australia stores  increased primarily due to the addition of five new stores opened since december  and sales increases from existing stores 
we do not expect this growth rate to continue because as we increase the number of our stores  each new store will have less proportional impact on our growth rate 
for those stores that were open for the full year ended december  and  same store sales grew by 
nevertheless  we cannot assure investors that retail store sales will continue to grow at their recent pace or that revenue from our retail store business will not at some point decline

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital and operating needs using a combination of our cash and cash equivalents balances  short term investments  cash generated from operations and  as needed  the credit available under our revolving credit facility 
in an economic recession or under other adverse economic conditions  we may be unable to realize a return on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  secure additional credit on favorable terms  renew our existing credit or access our existing line of credit 
such failures may impact our working capital reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business 
since the latter part of  us and foreign credit markets have experienced adverse conditions  including unusual volatility and a lack of secondary market liquidity  which conditions have presented  and continue to present  significant challenges to the investment markets and have limited the availability of short term debt for working capital 
while it is difficult to predict how long these adverse conditions will exist  these factors  if they continue  could adversely impact our future financial condition and our future results of operations 
our cash flow cycle includes the purchase of inventories  the subsequent sale of the inventories and the eventual collection of the resulting accounts receivables 
as a result  our working capital requirements begin when we purchase the inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting receivables 
the seasonality of our ugg brand business requires us to build fall and winter inventories in the second and third quarters to support sales for the ugg brand s major selling seasons  which historically occur during the third and fourth quarters 
given the seasonality of our ugg brand  our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
the cash required to fund these working capital fluctuations has been provided using our internal cash flows

table of contents cash from operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory in compared to the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased cash collections 
the decrease in inventory was largely due to decreased teva inventory  as we purchased in smaller quantities  more often  and closer to demand 
these changes were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable related to our decreased effective tax rate 
net working capital improved primarily as a result of higher cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by decreased accounts receivable 
the changes in working capital are due to increased sales and collections as well as our normal seasonality and timing of cash receipts and cash payments 
wholesale accounts receivable turnover increased from times in the twelve months ended december  to times in the twelve months ended december   primarily as a result of increased sales and faster collections in compared to due to the continued demand for ugg product in  which encouraged retailers to pay their receivables balances faster to expedite upcoming deliveries 
in  we used both wholesale and consumer direct sales in our accounts receivable turnover calculations 
as of september   we changed the method of our calculation to exclude consumer direct sales  as this is more consistent with how management views the business  and  in general  our consumer direct sales do not carry accounts receivable balances 
inventory turnover decreased from times for the year ended december  to times for the year ended december   largely due to higher average inventory balances during the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the higher average inventory balances were in support of our increased sales 
cash from investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities in was comprised primarily of net sales of short term investments  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and our acquisition of tsubo  llc 
our capital expenditures were primarily related to a new inventory pick module in our distribution center  leasehold improvements for new retail stores  and computer hardware and software 
net cash used in investing activities in was comprised primarily of purchases of property and equipment and net purchases of short term investments 
our larger capital expenditures were related to the build out of new retail stores  expansion of our warehouse pick module and computer hardware and software 
as our short term investments matured  we invested in cash equivalents  thus decreasing purchases and sales of short term investments 
as of december   we had no material commitments for future capital expenditures  but we estimate that the capital expenditures for will range from approximately  to  and anticipate those will include the build out of new retail stores and miscellaneous computer hardware and software 
we intend to amend our credit facility to increase the capital expenditure limits set forth in the credit agreement 
the actual amount of capital expenditures for may differ from this estimate  largely depending on any unforeseen needs to replace existing assets and the timing of expenditures 
cash from financing activities 
in  net cash provided by financing activities consisted of the excess tax benefits from shared based compensation as well as the contribution from our new joint venture partner and cash received from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by cash paid for shares withheld for taxes 
in  net cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
in addition  we used cash for shares withheld for taxes from employee stock unit vestings  primarily offset by excess tax benefits from stock compensation 
in june  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
the program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
the purchases will be funded from available working capital 
as of december   we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock under this program for approximately  or an 
table of contents average price of per share 
as of december   the remaining amount approved to repurchase shares is approximately our revolving credit facility with comerica bank  or the facility  provides for a maximum availability of  up to  of borrowings may be in the form of letters of credit 
the facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate at december  or  at our option  at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  at december  plus to  depending on our ratio of liabilities to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the facility includes annual commitment fees of per year and expires on june  at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility and outstanding letters of credit of as a result   was available under the facility at december  the agreements underlying the facility contain certain financial covenants 
we amended the facility in june  including amending some of these covenants 
the covenants currently include a limitation on aggregate annual lease payments of  a quick ratio requirement of at least  a minimum profitability requirement of  per fiscal quarter except for the quarter ended june   there was a maximum net loss of  a limitation on annual consolidated capital expenditures of  in fiscal year and  in any fiscal year thereafter  a minimum tangible net worth requirement of  commencing with the fiscal year ended december   plus of consolidated net profit on a cumulative basis  and a requirement that our consolidated total liabilities to consolidated effective tangible net worth ratio be no greater than 
the agreements also contain a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants and remain so as of the date of this report 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total our operating lease obligations consist primarily of building leases for our retail locations  distribution centers  and corporate and regional offices 
other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet include primarily deferred rents  which are included in operating lease obligations in this table 
our purchase obligations consist largely of purchase orders 
they also include promotional expenses  service contracts  and minimum purchase commitments 
outstanding purchase orders are primarily with our third party manufacturers and are expected to be paid within one year 
these are outstanding open orders and not minimum obligations 
our promotional expenditures and service contracts are due periodically through in february  we entered into a contract requiring minimum purchase commitments of sheepskin with a remaining commitment of approximately  as of december  that deckers affiliates  manufacturers  factories and other agents each or collectively  a buyer must make on or before december  this contract may result in an unconditional purchase obligation if a buyer does not meet the minimum purchase requirements 
in the event that a buyer does not purchase such minimum commitments on or before december   deckers is required to purchase any remaining amounts on or before december  we expect our sheepskin purchases by third party factories supplying ugg product to us will exceed these levels 
therefore  we do not anticipate having to make any non performance payments under this 
table of contents contractual arrangement  however  we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments will occur and have included the remaining amount in this table 
we believe this will not materially affect our liquidity or results of operations  as it is in the normal course of our business 
the unrecognized tax benefits are related to uncertain tax positions taken in our income tax return that would impact the effective tax rate or additional paid in capital  if recognized 
in addition to the amounts in the table above  we have entered into other off balance sheet arrangements we agreed to make loans to our joint venture with stella international  should the need arise 
as of december   the estimated total loans by deckers and stella international was expected to be approximately  contributed by both parties in proportion to their respective ownership in the joint venture 
we also have potential future earn out payments relating to our may acquisition of tsubo  llc and our march acquisition of ahnu  inc the potential earn out for tsubo  llc is based on the amount  if any  that sales of tsubo products exceed certain base revenue levels for each year from to see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the potential earn out for ahnu  inc is based on the amount  if any  that gross profit of ahnu products exceeds certain base levels for each year from to see note  business combinations  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
these amounts were excluded from the table above as all conditions for the earn out payments have not been met 
as of december   the present value of the earn out payments of is included within long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we entered into or amended agreements with certain of our international distributors to assume control of the distribution rights in those regions 
under these agreements  we expect to make total payments to these distributors of approximately  from through the payments include consideration for the purchase of certain assets and services 
we believe that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under our existing facility or a new credit facility  cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
however  risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain our cash position include our growth rate  the continued strength of our brands  our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences  our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our ability to effectively manage our inventories  the availability of short term credit  and market volatility  among others 
see part i  item a  and risk factors for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our working capital position 
furthermore  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a new credit facility or draw on our existing facility 
the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in incurring debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
although there are no other material present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any other businesses  we may evaluate acquisitions of other businesses or brands 
impact of inflation we believe that the rates of inflation in the three most recent fiscal years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowances for estimated returns  discounts  chargebacks  and bad debts are provided for when related revenue is recorded 
amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net sales  while the related costs paid to third party shipping companies are recorded as a cost of sales 
we present revenue net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures about contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience  existing and known circumstances  authoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable 
management reasonably could use different estimates and assumptions  and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically been materially accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following table summarizes data related to the critical accounting estimates for accounts receivable allowances and reserves  which are discussed below december  december  amount of gross trade accounts receivable amount of gross trade accounts receivable gross trade accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for sales discounts allowance for estimated chargebacks amount of net sales amount of net sales net sales for the three months ended allowance for estimated returns estimated returns liability allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged trade accounts receivables  economic conditions and forecasts  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts  which all or a portion of are identified as potentially uncollectible  plus a non specific reserve for the balance of accounts based on our historical loss experience 
reserves have been established for all projected losses of this nature 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts from december  to december  was primarily due to an increase in one account s specific reserve because that account filed for bankruptcy 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts we consider to have credit risk and are not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by approximately 
table of contents reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of our domestic net sales and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that the customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment and payment timelines 
we estimate the amount of the discounts that are available to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable  and we record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
the decrease in the reserve as a percentage of accounts receivable was primarily due to a lower percentage of total outstanding customer balances being eligible for terms discounts 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example a change in the estimate of the percentage of accounts that will ultimately take their discount would change the reserve for sales discounts at december  by approximately allowance for estimated chargebacks 
when our domestic wholesale customers pay their invoices  they often take deductions for chargebacks against their invoices  which are often valid 
therefore  we record an allowance for the balance of chargebacks that are outstanding in our accounts receivable balance as of the end of each quarter  along with an estimated reserve for chargebacks that have not yet been taken against outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate is based on historical trends of the timing of chargebacks taken against invoices 
the increase in the allowance was largely attributable to a substantial increase in accounts receivable turnover and increased sales in the fourth quarter of  resulting in increased chargeback activity compared to allowance for estimated returns 
we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end and a liability for anticipated returns of goods sold direct to consumers 
in general  we accept returns for damaged or defective products but discourage returns for other reasons 
we also accept returns from our retail and ecommerce customers for a thirty day period 
we base the amounts of the allowance and liability on any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns rates  among other factors 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the reserve for returns at december  by approximately  inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete  and impaired inventory 
in doing so  we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or estimated future net selling prices 
at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  the decrease in inventory write downs at december  compared to december  was primarily due to sales of previously written down inventory during  primarily in our teva and simple brand inventories 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write down reserve at december  by approximately valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we assess the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets on a separate asset basis based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying amount of these assets individually 
we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of december based on the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill and the fair value of the assets for nonamortizable intangibles compared to their respective carrying value 
we consider other long lived assets to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other considerations  we consider the following factors the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  
table of contents changes in consumer demand or acceptance of the related brand names  products or features associated with the assets  increased competition  and deterioration of general economic conditions or the retail environment  and customers reducing orders in response to such conditions 
if we determine the assets to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
in addition  as it relates to long lived assets  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on the estimate of the period that the assets will generate sales or otherwise be used by us 
as of june   our inability to reach our teva brand period to date sales targets along with a reduced long term forecast for teva brand sales growth were indicators that the teva goodwill and other intangible assets were possibly impaired 
as a result  we conducted an interim impairment evaluation of the teva goodwill and other intangible assets as of june  and concluded that the teva goodwill was not impaired  but the fair value of the teva trademarks was lower than the carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss of  in the second quarter of on the teva trademarks 
as of december   due in part to the continued decline in the economy in the second half of  we reduced our long term teva brand sales forecast 
in addition  as of december   we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization due to declines in market multiples 
as a result of the reduced sales forecast and the decline in market capitalization  we concluded that the fair value of our teva trademarks and teva goodwill were below their respective carrying amounts 
further  due to the decline in our market capitalization  we concluded that the fair value of our tsubo goodwill was also below its carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of of  on our teva trademarks and  on our goodwill  which was the entire balance of both our teva and tsubo goodwill 
the impairment loss is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as of june   our inability to reach our tsubo brand period to date sales targets along with a reduced long term forecast for tsubo brand sales growth were indicators that the tsubo intangible assets were possibly impaired 
as a result  we conducted an interim impairment evaluation of the tsubo intangible assets as of june  and concluded that the fair value of the tsubo trademarks was lower than the carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss of  in the second quarter of on the tsubo trademarks 
in addition  we began amortizing the remaining balance of the tsubo trademarks over years 
on december   we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets using market value approaches and valuation techniques and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets as of december  our use of different estimates including estimated royalty rates  discount rates  market multiples  and future revenues  among others and assumptions could produce different financial results 
as of december   our teva trademarks had a carrying value of  at that date  our estimate of the trademarks fair value was approximately greater than the carrying value 
accordingly  if growth rates fail to meet our forecasts  impairment of the teva trademark may occur in the future 
our goodwill balance at december  represents goodwill primarily in the ugg reporting unit which has a fair value substantially in excess of the carrying value 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation transactions with employees are accounted for using the fair value method and expensed ratably over the vesting period of the award 
stock compensation expense is based on the fair values of all share based awards as of the grant date 
determining the expense of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the percentage of awards that will be forfeited  probabilities of meeting criteria for performance based awards  stock volatility  the expected life of the award  and other inputs 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the estimates  stock compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
although we have used foreign currency hedges in the past  we currently do not utilize forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate  as the majority of our purchases and sales for the foreseeable future will be denominated in us currency 
as our international operations grow and we increase purchases and sales in foreign currencies  we will evaluate and utilize derivative instruments  as needed  to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
although the majority of our sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us currency  our sales and inventory purchases may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in the international markets where our products are sold and manufactured 
if the us dollar strengthens  it may result in increased pricing pressure on our distributors  which may have a negative impact on our net sales and gross margins 
we are unable to estimate the amount of any impact on sales and gross margins attributed to pricing pressures caused by fluctuations in exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
our market risk exposure with respect to financial instruments is to changes in the prime rate in the us and changes in libor 
our revolving line of credit provides for interest on outstanding borrowings at rates tied to the prime rate or at our election tied to libor 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
a increase in interest rates on our current borrowings would have no impact on income before income taxes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our foreign assets and liabilities 
we manage these risks by attempting to denominate contractual and other foreign arrangements in us dollars and by maintaining a significant percentage of our liabilities in us dollars 
we do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature of our primary market risk exposures  including the categories of market risk to which we are exposed and the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we do not know of or expect there to be any material change in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term
