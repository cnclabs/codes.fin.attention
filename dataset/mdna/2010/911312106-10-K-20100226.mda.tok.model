items affecting comparability the year over year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items amounts in millions year ended december  operating expenses aircraft impairment charges goodwill impairment charge intangible impairment charge svso charge pension plan withdrawal charge france restructuring charges interest expense currency remeasurement charge income tax expense benefit from the items above aircraft impairment charges in the first quarter of  we completed an impairment assessment of our mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft fleet  and recorded an impairment charge of million  which affected our us domestic package segment 
in the first quarter of  we completed an impairment assessment of our boeing and aircraft fleets  and recognized an impairment charge of million  of which million impacted our us domestic package segment and million impacted our international package segment 
these charges  as well as our accounting policies pertaining to long lived assets  are discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates 

table of contents goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit  which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in  had a goodwill impairment of million 
this charge  as well as our accounting policies pertaining to goodwill  is discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates 
intangible impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  we completed an impairment assessment on a customer list intangible asset related to our domestic package entity in the united kingdom 
we recorded a million charge related to this assessment  which is further discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates 
special voluntary separation opportunity svso charge in december  we offered the svso to approximately employees who worked in non operating functions 
this program was established to improve the efficiency of non operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company 
the svso ended in february  and  or of eligible employees  accepted the offer 
as a result  we recorded a charge to expense of approximately million in the first quarter of  to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the svso program 
pension plan withdrawal charge our national master agreement with the teamsters allowed us  upon ratification  to withdraw employees from the central states pension fund and to establish a jointly trusteed single employer plan for this group ups ibt pension plan 
upon ratification of the contract in december and our withdrawal from the central states pension fund  we recorded a billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability  and made a december payment in the same amount to the central states pension fund to satisfy this liability 
the withdrawal liability was based on computations performed by independent actuaries employed by the central states pension fund  in accordance with the plan document and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
we negotiated our withdrawal from the central states pension fund as part of our national master agreement with the teamsters  which included other modifications to hourly wage rates  healthcare and pension benefits  and work rules 
we sought to negotiate our withdrawal from the central states pension fund  as we believed the fund would likely continue to have funding challenges  and would present a risk to ups of having to face higher future contribution requirements and a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those ups employees who participated in the fund 
we believe that we benefited financially from the ability to achieve a ratified national master agreement seven months before the expiration of the previous agreement  as well as by gaining better control over the future cost and funding of pension benefits by limiting our obligations solely to ups teamster employees through the new ups ibt pension plan 
as the ups ibt pension plan matures  we believe that it will become cost beneficial from a cash flow and earnings standpoint compared with having remained in the central states pension fund 
france restructuring charge in the third quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in france 
the objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the europe region 
the restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program  which was ratified by our company s trade union representatives in france in july employees participating in this program were entitled to severance benefits  including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase 
these severance benefits were formula driven and were in accordance with french statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in related to this program 

table of contents currency remeasurement charge during the second quarter of  we incurred a million non cash  pre tax currency remeasurement charge on certain foreign currency denominated obligations 
results of operations segment review the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments 
we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain non gaap financial measures  including operating profit  operating margin  pre tax income  net income and earnings per share adjusted for the non comparable items discussed previously 
we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance 
we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of  or are unrelated to  our core operating results  and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses

our air product volume was stronger than our ground volume  as our air volume benefited from market share gains resulting from the recent departure of a competitor in the us market  as well as improving economic trends in the latter half of the year 
the growth in air volume was strongest in our less time sensitive products  such as next day air saver and three day select

ground volume demonstrated an improving trend over the previous quarters despite a decline in the fourth quarter compared with compared to us domestic ground and air volume declined primarily as a result of the recession in the us economy 
relatively high energy costs during most of  combined with the deepening recession and weak output within the industrial production and retail sales sectors  adversely affected the small package market  which placed additional pressure on our domestic package volume 
these declining volume trends worsened through the year with next day air  deferred  and ground volume declining   and  respectively  during the fourth quarter 
revenue per piece compared to revenue per piece for our air products was negatively affected in by a decline in the fuel surcharge rate for air products 
additionally  the revenue per piece decline for our air products was impacted by lower average package weights and a mix shift toward lower yielding products  reflecting the economic recession in the united states 
the decline in revenue per piece for our ground products was primarily due to a decrease in the fuel surcharge rate  but was also impacted by lower average package weights 
the factors decreasing revenue per piece for our ground and air products were partially offset by an increase in base rates that took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground 
other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge  and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 
these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 
the trend towards lower package weights began to stabilize in the fourth quarter  however product mix within our air and ground services continued to adversely impact revenue per piece  as the lower yielding products within those categories represented a larger share of our overall package volume 
compared to revenue per piece for our air products increased primarily due to a base rate increase and a higher fuel surcharge rate for air products 
this increase was adversely impacted by lower average package weights  a mix shift toward lower yielding products  and hedging losses

the air fuel surcharge is based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel  while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge for domestic air and ground products was as follows year ended december  change next day air deferred ground on january  and december   we modified the fuel surcharge on air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 
the decrease and increase in the air and ground fuel surcharges are due to the significant variations in jet and diesel fuel prices in addition to the reduction in the index on the air surcharge

operating profit and margin compared to operating profit in was adversely impacted by the us economic recession  decreased network efficiencies due to the decline in volume  changes in package characteristics  and a shift in product mix away from our premium services 
operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense 
we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match these lower volume levels  as well as reduced labor hours and employee headcount  resulting in cost savings 
operating profit trends improved during the fourth quarter of due to both improving volume trends and the positive impact of continued cost and production efficiencies  which combined to improve the operating margin to for the quarter 
compared to operating profit in was adversely impacted by the us recession  lower asset utilization due to the decline in volume  lower average package weights  and a shift in product mix away from our premium services  partially offset by the increase in the fuel surcharge relative to the cost of fuel 
because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of  operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments 
because of this time lag  fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during  which is the opposite effect the company experienced in  when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted

table of contents revenue compared to forwarding and logistics revenue decreased for the year  and was caused primarily by weakness in demand for freight forwarding due to global economic weakness and declines in international trade 
forwarding revenue declined in all major transportation modes  including domestic and international air freight and ocean freight  and was impacted by lower volumes  lower fuel surcharges  and lower security and other accessorial charges 
logistics distribution and post sales service revenue also declined  primarily resulting from the weak global economy  however mail services revenue increased for the year 
freight revenue declined  primarily due to lower fuel surcharge rates and a decline in average daily ltl shipments 
total ltl weight per shipment declined for the year  reflecting the weak ltl market and the ongoing economic recession in the united states in average ltl shipments per day also declined  as market share gains were more than offset by the impact of the weak economy 
ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased  primarily as a result of the lower fuel surcharge rates  as total fuel surcharge revenue declined million for the year primarily resulting from lower diesel fuel prices

the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business and our financial business  experienced a decline in revenue  primarily caused by lower interest rates and decreased loan volume in our financial business 
revenue trends for our forwarding  logistics  and ltl products improved in the fourth quarter of  largely resulting from favorable comparisons with the prior year 
the change in revenue for our forwarding and logistics businesses benefited from the weaker us dollar during the quarter  while revenue in the forwarding and ltl units continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue 
compared to forwarding and logistics revenue increased  primarily due to growth in international air freight  north american air freight  distribution services and mail services 
revenue growth in this business was affected by fuel and security surcharges  expanded air freight service offerings  overall market growth and improved customer retention rates 
growth was negatively impacted by weakness in the ocean freight business

revenue declined by million in the fourth quarter of  as difficult worldwide economic conditions  slowing world trade  and unfavorable currency exchange rate movements negatively impacted the forwarding and logistics businesses 
the strengthening us dollar resulted in a million negative impact to the change in revenue in the fourth quarter 

table of contents operating profit and margin compared to the lower operating profit in the forwarding unit was impacted by the weak global demand for forwarding services  as well as capacity reductions by outside ocean and air freight carriers 
during the latter half of and particularly in the fourth quarter  capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers  resulting in a negative impact to operating profit and margin 
the operating profit for our logistics unit declined slightly  and was impacted by the loss incurred on the sale of some non core european logistics operations 
however  the operating margin in this business remained stable  as costs were reduced commensurate with the decline in revenues 
our ups freight unit reported improved profitability for  due to a reduction in vacation accruals resulting from modifications in vacation policies and changes in the workforce coverage of our individual plans 
excluding this reduction in vacation liabilities  the ups freight unit reported a small operating loss due to the economic recession and difficult ltl market in the united states 
the combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased during the year 
the increase was primarily driven by a gain on sale of substantially all of our international mail boxes etc operations during the second quarter 
compared to operating profit improved in the forwarding and logistics businesses  primarily resulting from revenue management initiatives and a focus on asset utilization

table of contents compensation and benefits the decrease in compensation and benefits expense during compared with was impacted by several items 
a large component of this decrease was related to employee payroll costs  as union labor hours declined as a result of lower us domestic package volume  and management payroll declined as a result of a reduction in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with a wage freeze 
benefits expense increased due to higher employee health and welfare program costs  which were impacted by higher union contribution rates  and increased pension expense 
pension expense increases resulted from higher union contribution rates for multi employer pension plans  combined with increased interest costs  a decrease in our expected return on plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses for company sponsored plans 
the interest cost grew due to continued service accruals  while the decrease in expected return on plan assets and the actuarial losses were primarily due to the negative asset returns experienced in the overall increase in benefits expense was partially offset by a freeze in the company contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan 
compensation and benefits expense increased in compared with  excluding charges for the multi employer pension plan withdrawal  the svso and the france restructuring 
increased benefit expenses were largely due to higher employee health and welfare program costs  which was impacted by medical cost inflation 
employee payroll costs increased due to contractual wage increases for our union employees and normal merit increases for our non union employees 
repairs and maintenance repairs and maintenance expense declined in  largely due to reduced vehicle maintenance expenses resulting from a reduction in miles driven 
the increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased aircraft maintenance  somewhat offset by reduced vehicle maintenance expense 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased in  primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense on equipment and facilities  as certain worldport assets became fully depreciated  as well as lower software amortization resulting from fewer new capitalized software projects 
these decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles  resulting from new deliveries in and the increase in depreciation and amortization in resulted primarily from higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles due to new deliveries  but was partially offset by reduced amortization expense on capitalized software resulting from a decrease in software development projects 
purchased transportation the decrease in purchased transportation in was driven by a combination of lower volume in our international package and forwarding businesses  a stronger us dollar  and decreased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third party carriers as a result of lower fuel prices 
the increase in purchased transportation in was attributable to a combination of higher volume in our international package and forwarding businesses  a weaker us dollar  and increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third party carriers resulting from higher fuel prices 
fuel the decrease in fuel expense in was impacted by significantly lower prices for jet a fuel  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  as well as lower usage of these products in our operations 
the increase in fuel expense in resulted from higher prices for jet a fuel  diesel  and unleaded gasoline as well as lower hedging gains 

table of contents other occupancy the decrease in other occupancy expense in was primarily caused by lower electricity and natural gas costs  as well as lower rent expense 
the increase in other occupancy expense resulted from higher rent  property tax  electricity and natural gas expense 
the changes in both years were significantly impacted by changes in energy commodity prices 
other expenses the decline in other expenses in  exclusive of impairment charges  was due in part to certain variable costs that declined as a result of lower package volume  such as the expense associated with customer claims for lost or damaged packages  rent expense for transportation equipment  cargo handling costs  and aircraft landing fees 
additionally  certain other costs declined primarily as a result of cost containment programs  such as employee expense reimbursements  office supplies  professional services  and advertising costs 
the increase in other expenses in  exclusive of impairment charges  was attributable to increased expenses for leased transportation equipment  data processing  advertising  professional services  and bad debts 
investment income and interest expense year ended december  change investment income and interest expense in millions investment income interest expense impact of currency remeasurement charge adjusted interest expense investment income the decline was largely due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments  a significantly lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the united states  and a loss on the fair value adjustments of certain investment partnerships 
the decline was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments  a lower yield earned on our investments  and impairment losses 
during the second quarter of  we recorded impairment losses on certain perpetual preferred securities  and an auction rate security collateralized by preferred securities  issued by large financial institutions 
the impairment charge resulted from conversion offers from the issuers of these securities at prices well below the stated redemption value of the preferred shares 
these securities  which had a cost basis of million  were written down to their fair value of million as of june   resulting in an other than temporary impairment of million 
during the third quarter of  we recorded impairment losses on two auction rate securities that were collateralized by preferred stock issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
the impairment resulted from actions by the us treasury department and the federal housing finance agency to place fnma and fhlmc under conservatorship 
additionally  we recorded impairment losses on a municipal auction rate security and on holdings of several medium term notes issued by lehman brothers inc  which declared bankruptcy during the third quarter of the total of these credit related impairment losses was million 
interest expense excluding the currency remeasurement charge  the decrease in interest expense was largely due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps 

table of contents the increase in interest expense was largely due to a higher average balance of outstanding debt 
in early  we completed the issuance of billion in long term debt  the proceeds of which were used to reduce our commercial paper balance 
our commercial paper balances had previously increased to fund the billion central states pension fund withdrawal payment in december the impact of increased debt balances was partially mitigated  however  by lower average rates incurred on our variable rate debt and interest rate swap agreements as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the united states throughout income tax expense year ended december  change income tax expense   n a effective tax rate compared to income tax expense declined primarily due to lower pre tax income 
the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges described previously  which were not deductible for tax purposes and resulted in the effective tax rate increasing by 
compared to income tax expense increased primarily due to higher pre tax income 
pre tax income in was adversely impacted by the central states withdrawal charge  as noted previously 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to several factors resulting from the central states withdrawal charge in these factors included having proportionally lower tax credits in  and the effect of having a much higher proportion of our taxable income in being subject to tax in the united states  whereas a relatively greater proportion of taxable income in was subject to tax outside the united states  where effective tax rates are generally lower 
the effective tax rate in was also higher due to the lack of tax deductibility of the goodwill and intangible impairment charges discussed previously 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the to time period  however in operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund  as previously discussed 
in  operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the decline in profitability for our three reporting segments 
however  the impact of this decline was partially offset by reduced working capital needs 
most of the remaining variability in our operating cash flows was primarily due to changes in pension contributions and the timing of income tax payments 
the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our operating cash flows in millions net income non cash operating activities a pension and postretirement plan contributions ups sponsored plans income tax receivables and payables changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities other operating activities net cash from operating activities 
table of contents a represents depreciation and amortization  gains and losses on derivative transactions and foreign exchange  deferred income taxes  provisions for uncollectible accounts  pension and postretirement benefit expense  stock compensation expense  impairment charges  and other non cash items 
contributions to our company sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 
the increase in contributions in was largely due to minimum funding requirements related to the ups ibt pension plan 
as discussed further in the contractual commitments section  we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years  primarily related to the ups ibt pension plan 
during the to period  we made no significant discretionary contributions to our plans 
the central states pension fund withdrawal payment was made in december  and significantly impacted operating cash flow 
the payment was deductible for us federal and state income tax purposes  and we therefore received cash tax benefits in the form of refunds or lower estimated payments during and the impact of the central states pension fund withdrawal payment on our cash flow from operations was as follows in millions impact of central states pension fund withdrawal payment central states pension fund withdrawal payment cash income tax benefits from withdrawal payment impact of the central states pension fund withdrawal payment and associated taxes on cash flow from operations investing activities our primary uses of cash flows for investing activities were for capital expenditures  as follows amounts in millions net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology capital expenditures as a of revenue other investing activities net increase decrease in finance receivables net purchases sales of marketable securities other items we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft  vehicles  equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 
in  we reduced capital spending to a level commensurate with our current anticipated operating needs 
future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors  including economic and industry conditions 

table of contents capital expenditures on buildings and facilities primarily resulted from our worldport hub expansion  as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other facilities in europe  canada and china 
in  we completed the first phase of our worldport expansion  which increased the sorting capacity by 
the final phase of the worldport expansion will be completed in  and will increase sorting capacity approximately more 
in  we opened our new international air hub in shanghai  china  and also began construction of our new intra asia air hub in shenzhen  china  which became operational in february capital spending on aircraft over the to period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing and  and md aircraft 
capital spending on vehicles was primarily for replacement assets in our package delivery and ltl operations 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately billion 
the net change in finance receivables is primarily due to customer paydowns and new loan origination activity  primarily in our commercial lending  asset based lending and leasing portfolios 
the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs  and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 
other investing activities include the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs  the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing and boeing aircraft orders  and changes in restricted cash balances 
we maintain an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our self insurance obligations  and we deposited and million in cash collateral with the insurance carrier under this agreement during and  respectively 
we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of   and million during   and  respectively

table of contents as a result of the uncertain economic environment  we have slowed our share repurchase activity 
we currently intend to repurchase shares in at a rate that should approximately offset the dilution from our stock compensation programs 
in january  the board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to billion 
share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases  open market purchases  or other such methods as we deem appropriate 
the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions 
unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board  the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program 
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors  including our net income  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and other relevant factors 
we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 
in  the board of directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the november dividend declaration  as in past years this dividend was payable the following january 
as a result  a total of five dividend payments were made in in february  we increased our quarterly dividend payment from to per share 
in  we increased our commercial paper borrowings to fund the billion withdrawal payment to the central states pension fund upon ratification of our labor contract with the teamsters 
in  we repaid most of this commercial paper with the proceeds from a billion senior fixed rate notes offering  as well as an million us federal tax refund received 
in  we completed an additional billion senior fixed rate notes offering 
other than commercial paper  repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations  redemption of facilities bonds and certain tranches of ups notes  and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain partnerships 
we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt 
other financing activities include certain hedging activities and cash received from common stock issuances to employees 
in conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in and  we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings  which resulted in cash outflows of and million in and  respectively 
sources of credit we are authorized to borrow up to billion under our us commercial paper program 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding  with an average interest rate of and a weighted average maturity of days 
the amount of commercial paper outstanding in is expected to fluctuate 
we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion in a variety of currencies  however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december  we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at day libor plus a percentage determined by quotations for our year credit default swap spread  subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s 
if our public debt ratings are a a or above  the minimum applicable margin is and the maximum applicable margin is  if our public debt ratings are lower than a a  the minimum applicable margin is and the maximum applicable margin is 
the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under either of these facilities 

table of contents in addition to these credit facilities  we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or long term debt securities 
our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers  however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants 
as of december  and for all prior periods presented  we have satisfied these financial covenants 
these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur  and limit the amount of attributable debt in sale leaseback transactions  to of net tangible assets 
as of december   of net tangible assets is equivalent to billion  however we have no covered sale leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding 
additionally  we are required to maintain a minimum net worth  as defined  of billion on a quarterly basis 
as of december   our net worth  as defined  was equivalent to billion 
we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements  including variable interest entities  which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 
contractual commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases  operating leases  debt obligations  purchase commitments  and certain other liabilities 
we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations 
the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions commitment type after total capital leases operating leases debt principal debt interest purchase commitments pension fundings other liabilities total our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft 
capital leases  operating leases  and purchase commitments  as well as our debt principal obligations  are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt  in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
for debt denominated in a foreign currency  the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 
purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  the largest of which are orders for aircraft  engines  and parts 
as of december   we maintain orders for boeing er freighters to be delivered between and  and boeing f aircraft scheduled for delivery during these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the ups ibt pension plan  which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the teamsters  as well as the ups retirement plan and the ups pension plan 
these plans are discussed further in note to the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of and the employee retirement income security act of  using discount rates  asset returns  and other assumptions appropriate for these plans 
to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections  the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 
additionally  we have not included minimum funding requirements beyond  because these projected contributions are not reasonably determinable 
we are not subject to any minimum funding requirement for cash contributions in in the ups retirement plan or ups pension plan 
the amount of any minimum funding requirement  as applicable  for these plans could change significantly in future periods  depending on many factors  including future plan asset returns and discount rates 
a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets  and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns  could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements 
such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods 
the contractual payments due for other liabilities primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships 
the table above does not include approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities  because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash 
in addition  although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits  we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities 
recognized and unrecognized tax benefits are further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately billion issued in connection with routine business requirements 
we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances  and as of december   we had million of surety bonds written 
as of december   we had unfunded loan commitments totaling million associated with our financial business 
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures  such as commitments for aircraft purchases  for the foreseeable future

at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  most us state and local jurisdictions  and many non us jurisdictions 
we have substantially resolved all us federal income tax matters for tax years prior to during the third quarter of  we received a refund of million as a result of the resolution of tax years through with the internal revenue service irs appeals office 
for the tax years through  we anticipate concluding the limited number of unagreed issues with the irs appeals office by the end of the second quarter of along with the audit for tax years through  the irs is currently examining non income based taxes  including employment and excise taxes  which could lead to proposed assessments 
the irs has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time  and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment 
we anticipate receipt of the irs reports on these matters by the end of the second quarter of we have filed all required us state and local returns reporting the result of the resolution of the us federal income tax audit of the tax years through a limited number of us state and local matters are the subject of ongoing audits  administrative appeals or litigation 
at this time  we do not expect any of the above tax matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood 
table of contents of teamsters teamsters 
these agreements run through july  we have approximately  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association  which becomes amendable at the end of our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which became amendable in november we began formal negotiations with teamsters local in october in addition  the majority approximately  of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam 
in june of  we reached a new agreement with the iam  which was subsequently ratified in july the new agreement runs through july  other matters we received grand jury subpoenas from the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj regarding the doj s investigations into certain pricing practices in the air cargo industry in july  and into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in december in october  june  and february  we received information requests from the european commission commission relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry  and subsequently responded to each request 
on february   ups received a statement of objections by the commission 
this document contains the commission s preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry by freight forwarders  including ups 
the statement of objections enables the addressees to respond 
although it alleges anticompetitive behavior  it does not prejudge the commission s final decision  as to facts or law which is subject to appeal to the european courts 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding 
we also received and responded to related information requests from competition authorities in other jurisdictions 
we are cooperating with each of these inquiries 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
new accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards provisions within the following accounting standards were adopted during the years covered by these financial statements financial instruments the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance in february that gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value ie  the fair value option  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates  such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
additionally  this guidance allowed for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption  with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings 
we adopted this standard on january   and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method 
accordingly  we recorded a million reduction to retained earnings as of january  these investments are reported in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents compensation retirement benefits we previously utilized the early measurement date option available in accounting for our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans  and we measured the funded status of our plans as of september each year 
under guidance issued by the fasb  we were required to use a december measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in as a result of this change in measurement date  we recorded a cumulative effect after tax million reduction to retained earnings as of january  beginning in  new guidance was adopted that required disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan  investment policies and strategies  major categories of plan assets  inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
these disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes effective beginning in  guidance issued by the fasb required that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
we adopted this new standard on january   and the cumulative effect of adopting this standard was to recognize a million decrease in the january  balance of retained earnings 
fair value measurements and disclosures the fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements that took effect on january  and are presented in notes     and to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we implemented the previously deferred provisions of this guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the accounting requirements for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased  and for identifying transactions that are not orderly  contained the fasb s guidance were adopted on april   but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
derivatives and hedging the fasb issued certain disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging transactions that took effect on january  and are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations the fasb issued new accounting requirements for business combinations  which took effect on january  this new guidance was applied to business combinations completed in  but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
consolidation the fasb issued accounting and presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests  which took effect on january   however this new guidance had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
accounting standards issued but not yet effective other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after december   are not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

table of contents contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable 
at the time a contingency is identified  we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation 
we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability 
these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
contingent losses that are probable and estimable  excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below  were not material to the company s financial position as of december  in addition  we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december   because a loss is not reasonably estimable 
goodwill and intangible impairment we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis 
our reporting units are comprised of the europe  asia  and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment  and the forwarding logistics  ups freight  mbe ups store  and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain freight reporting segment 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october st for each reporting unit 
the impairment test involves a two step process 
first  a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values  including goodwill  is performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model dcf model  and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies  as applicable 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions  and changes in our business strategy  government regulations  or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods 
if impairment indicators are present in future periods  the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit  which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in  had a goodwill impairment of million 
this impairment charge resulted from several factors  including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the ltl sector  and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar ltl industry participants 
at the time of acquisition of overnite corporation  ltl equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger 
we invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance  as well as expand service offerings 
however  this process took longer than initially anticipated  and thus financial results had been below our expectations 
additionally  the ltl sector in had been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the us  lower industrial production and retail sales  volatile fuel prices  and significant 
table of contents levels of price based competition 
by the fourth quarter of  the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit  leading to the goodwill impairment charge 
none of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in  nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in or changes in our forecasts could cause book values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods  potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 
all of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finite lived intangibles  and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible 
if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on a dcf model 
as a result of weak performance in our domestic uk package operations  we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment within our uk domestic package entity 
based on recent performance and near term projections  the value assigned to the customer list intangible asset acquired within the uk domestic package business was determined to be impaired 
this was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with the acquired business 
accordingly  an intangible asset impairment charge of million was recorded for the year ended december  no other intangible asset impairments were recognized in  nor were any such impairments recognized in or self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare  and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels  which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
workers compensation  automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals 
all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans  anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation 
actual results may differ from these estimates and  therefore  produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
fair value measurements in the normal course of business  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk  including derivatives  marketable securities  finance receivables  other investments  and debt 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value  principally derivatives  marketable securities  
table of contents pension assets  and certain other investments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads  and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange  and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices is presented in the market risk section of this report 
pension and postretirement medical benefits as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain several single employer defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rates of compensation increase  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable  and represent our best estimates  based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
a basis point change in the assumed discount rate  expected return on assets  and health care cost trend rate for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company s costs and obligations for the year in millions basis point increase basis point decrease pension plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation return on assets effect on net periodic benefit cost postretirement medical plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation health care cost trend rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation depreciation  residual value  and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our 
table of contents maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows  or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in estimating cash flows  we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business 
adverse changes in these volume forecasts  or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections  could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand 
this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type  resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 
in  we had announced that we were in negotiations with dhl to provide air transportation services for all of dhl s express  deferred and international package volume within the united states  as well as air transportation services between the united states  canada and mexico 
in early april  ups and dhl mutually agreed to terminate further discussions on providing these services 
additionally  our us domestic package air delivery volume had declined for several quarters as a result of persistent economic weakness and shifts in product mix from our premium air services to our lower cost ground services 
as a result of these factors  the utilization of certain aircraft fleet types had declined and was expected to be lower in the future 
based on the factors noted above  as well as faa aging aircraft directives that would require significant future maintenance expenditures  we determined that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment of our mcdonnell douglas dc and dc aircraft fleets 
we conducted an impairment analysis as of march   and determined that the carrying amount of these fleets was not recoverable due to the accelerated expected retirement dates of the aircraft 
based on anticipated residual values for the airframes  engines  and parts  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the first quarter of the dc fleets were subsequently retired from service 
as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of  including capacity optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates  we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses 
the review was completed in march  and based on the results of our evaluation  we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing and aircraft  and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction  tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

table of contents we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold  the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
allowance for doubtful accounts losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred  which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date 
these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience  adjusted for current conditions  trends in customer payment frequency  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk 
continued deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was and million  respectively 
our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december    and was   and million  respectively 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of commodity  foreign exchange  and interest rate forward contracts  options  and swaps 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline 
currently  the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes 
additionally  we periodically use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices 
as of december  and  however  we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated several energy derivatives and received million in cash 
this transaction was reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows 
as these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting  were designated as hedges  and maintained their effectiveness  the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges  which extended through the first quarter of foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of to months 
additionally  we utilize cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations 
the term of these swap agreements is commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 
interest rate risk we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations  as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans  which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period 
we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities  as well as cash equivalent instruments  some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest 
additionally  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 

table of contents equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk 
these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 
credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default 
sensitivity analysis the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
additionally  changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 
amounts in millions shock test result change in fair value currency derivatives change in annual expense variable rate debt interest rate derivatives the potential change in fair value from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar against local currency exchange rates across all maturities 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances 
the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in critical accounting policies and estimates 
the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates  respectively  was not material as of december  or the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of december  or
