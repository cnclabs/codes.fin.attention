item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada 
the impact of significant differences between canadian and united states us accounting principles on the financial statements is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the date of this discussion is february  unless otherwise noted  tabular amounts are in millions of canadian dollars 
oil and gas volumes  reserves and related performance measures are presented on a working interest before royalties basis 
we measure our performance in this manner consistent with other canadian oil and gas companies 
where appropriate  we have provided information on an after royalty basis in tabular format 
investors should read the special note regarding forward looking statements on page canadian investors should read the special note to canadian investors on page which highlights differences between our reserve estimates and related disclosures that are otherwise required by canadian regulatory authorities 
executive summary results cdn millions  except as stated production before royalties mboe d production after royalties mboe d cash flow from operating activities net income earnings per common share  basic share net debt production before royalties reflects our working interest before royalties 
we have presented our working interest before royalties as we measure our performance on this basis consistent with other canadian oil and gas companies 
long term debt and short term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents 
in  we generated cash flow from operating activities of billion and net income of million 
the decline from the prior year was primarily due to lower commodity prices as wti averaged us bbl for the year  down from wti started the year at approximately us bbl before recovering to almost us bbl by the end of dated brent decreased to average us bbl over the same period 
the impact of lower commodity prices was partially offset by changes in the us canadian foreign exchange rate  which averaged cents in as compared to cents last year 
production before royalties averaged  boe d in  below last year s volumes 
at buzzard  planned downtime reduced our production  while in yemen our fields continued to mature 
these decreases were partially offset by the start up of the ettrick field in the uk north sea  the longhorn field in the us gulf of mexico and higher bitumen production at long lake 
our production after royalties increased slightly over last year as a result of lower royalty rates on our canadian gas production and higher long lake bitumen volumes 
production after royalties increased slightly to average  boe d  as higher margin barrels displaced higher royalty barrels 
our production in the fourth quarter averaged  boe d  higher than the third quarter as buzzard returned to full rates during the quarter and we brought longhorn and ettrick on stream 
in  we expect production to range between  and  boe d before royalties 
over the last three years  our production after royalties has grown at an average compounded rate of

despite lower commodity prices  our cash netbacks remain strong 
much of our production has low operating costs and royalties  resulting in annual cash netbacks of boe before royalties 
our net debt increased by million as capital investments  including costs to acquire an additional working interest in long lake early in the year  exceeded our cash flow from operating activities by billion 
this increase was partially offset by the weaker us dollar  which reduced our us dollar denominated debt and cash by approximately million 
our financial position is strong 
for the past several years  we invested significant capital in a number of major development projects such as buzzard and long lake 
with the investment in these projects behind us and production ramping up at ettrick  longhorn and long lake  we expect to fund our next generation of new growth projects from operating cash flows 
these projects include golden eagle in the uk north sea  usan offshore west africa  future phases of long lake and shale gas in the horn river basin in northeast british columbia  as well as several exploration prospects 
our available liquidity is currently billion  comprised of cash and undrawn committed credit facilities  most of which are available until in response to improving credit markets  we issued us billion of senior notes during the year  which were used to repay a portion of our outstanding term credit facilities as well as for general corporate purposes 
issuing this debt increased the average term to maturity of our debt to years 
strategy progress cdn millions capital investment  including acquisitions proved oil and gas reserves before royalties mmboe proved oil and gas reserves after royalties mmboe includes developed and undeveloped proved reserves as at december our strategy is to build a sustainable energy company focused in three growth areas oil sands  conventional exploration and exploitation  and unconventional gas 
our investment in these areas generated the following results in oil sands we acquired an additional interest in the long lake project and joint venture lands from opti  increasing our ownership level to 
following this acquisition  we are now responsible for operating both the sagd bitumen extraction process and the upgrader for phase  as well as future phases 
during the year  we confirmed that our long lake design gasifies the bottom of the bitumen barrel and that we can upgrade bitumen to premium synthetic oil 
bitumen production ramped up as we increased our steam availability  conventional exploration and development our conventional exploration program was focused in the uk and norwegian north sea  deep water gulf of mexico and offshore west africa 
we were successful by bringing ettrick and longhorn on stream during the year  and from advancing the developments of usan and the buzzard hs processing facilities 
we had exploration success during the year at golden eagle and owowo  and unconventional gas we have a significant land position in the horn river basin in northeast british columbia 
our drilling and completion program realized substantial cost savings  productivity improvements and demonstrated that we could successfully frac the shale to allow the gas to flow 
we now have five shale gas wells on stream and achieved peak rates of over mmcf d during the year 

table of contents during  our proved oil and gas reserves additions replaced of our oil and gas production after royalties before the year end transition to new sec reserves rules 
excluding economic revisions  we replaced of our oil and gas production after royalties 
the difference in economic revisions between before and after royalties reflects an increase in oil sands royalties related to higher oil prices 
oil and gas mmboe before royalties after royalties production proved reserve changes excluding production net additions economic revisions the majority of our additions before economic revisions relate to our long lake acquisition  successful exploitation of our north sea fields at buzzard and telford  and elsewhere at long lake  offshore west africa  syncrude and masila 
economic revisions are largely related to positive revisions from oil price increases  somewhat offset by negative revisions from decreases in gas prices 
outlook in  we expect our annual production to grow approximately to  assuming the midpoint of our guidance  and range from  to  boe d  to  boe d after royalties 
this growth reflects a full year of production from ettrick and longhorn  and increasing volumes from long lake 
at the high end of our guidance  our production growth would be as high as 
the low end includes the possibility of advancing the start up of the fourth platform at buzzard which is currently scheduled for advancement to would only be required if we see higher than expected levels of hydrogen sulphide 
the downtime associated with advancing the start up could reduce annual volumes by  to  boe d 
our capital investment plans for total billion 
we plan to finance this investment through cash flow from operating activities and existing cash and cash equivalents 
our capital program will advance our future growth areas as we move forward with developing several major identified projects including buzzard  usan  golden eagle and horn river shale gas 
we also plan to spend approximately million drilling wells to advance our new growth exploration and appraisal opportunities  primarily in the north sea and the gulf of mexico 
we continue to monitor economic conditions and commodity prices and are prepared to adjust our capital investment program accordingly 
at december   we had billion of cash on hand  and billion of undrawn committed credit facilities 
the primary debt maturity in the next few years is our billion term credit facility which matures in  of which billion was drawn at december  and million was utilized to support outstanding letters of credit 
we also have million in undrawn uncommitted credit facilities at december   of which million was utilized to support outstanding letters of credit 
the average term to maturity of our debt is approximately years
