presentation of financial reporting periods the comparative periods presented are for the years ended december   and 
table of contents revenue we currently generate revenue through our suite of services  including our private label suite of products for small and medium sized businesses  pay per click advertising  call based advertising services  publishing network  and historically our feed management and related services 
our primary sources of revenue are the performance based advertising services  which include pay per click services  pay for call services  cost per action services and historically our feed management and related services 
these primary sources amounted to greater than of our revenues in all periods presented 
our secondary sources of revenue are our campaign management services  natural search optimization services and outsourced search marketing platforms 
these secondary sources amounted to less than of our revenues in all periods presented 
we have no barter transactions 
we recognize revenue upon the completion of our performance obligation  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties 
collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owing that occurs subsequent to period ends 
performance based advertising services in providing pay per click and call based advertising services  we generate revenue upon our delivery of qualified and reported click throughs or phone calls to our advertisers or advertising service providers listings 
these advertisers and advertising service providers pay us a designated transaction fee for each click through or phone call  which occurs when an online user clicks on or makes a phone call based on any of their advertisement listings after it has been placed by us or by our distribution partners 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction 
the advertisement listings are displayed within our distribution network  which includes search engines  directories  destination sites  third party internet domains or web sites  our portfolio of owned web sites  other targeted web based content and mobile and offline sources 
we also generate revenue from cost per action services  which occurs when the online user is redirected from one of our web sites or a third party web site in our distribution network to an advertiser web site and completes the specified action  such as when a call is placed 
in providing pay per click contextual targeting services  advertisers purchase keywords or keyword strings  based on an amount they choose for a targeted placement on vertically focused web sites or specific pages of a web site that are specific to their products or services and their marketing objectives 
the contextual results distributed by our services are prioritized for users by the amount the advertiser is willing to pay each time a user clicks on the merchant s advertisement and the relevance of the merchant s advertisement  which is dictated by historical click through rates 
advertisers pay us when a click through occurs on their advertisement 
in providing feed management services  advertisers pay for their web pages and product databases to be crawled  or searched  and included in search engine  directory and product shopping engine results within our distribution network 
generally  the feed management listings are presented in a different section of the web page than the pay per click listings 
for this service  revenue is generated when an online user clicks on a feed management listing from search engine  directory or product shopping engine results 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction for which the advertiser pays for on a per click basis 
the placement of a feed management result is largely determined by its relevancy  as determined by the distribution partner 
yahoo discontinued its feed management service relationship with us effective december  as a result of its recently announced partnership with microsoft 
accordingly  we discontinued our feed management and related service offerings as of that date 

table of contents search marketing services advertisers pay us additional fees for services such as campaign management and natural search engine optimization 
advertisers generally pay us on a click through basis  although in certain cases we receive a fixed fee for delivery of these services 
in some cases we also deliver banner campaigns for select advertisers 
we may also charge initial set up  account  service or inclusion fees as part of our services 
banner advertising revenue may be based on a fixed fee per click and is generated and recognized on click through activity 
in other cases  banner payment terms are volume based with revenue generated and recognized when impressions are delivered 
non refundable account set up fees are paid by advertisers and are recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the contract or the average expected advertiser relationship period  which generally ranges from twelve months to more than two years 
other account and service fees are recognized in the month or period the account fee or services relate to 
other inclusion fees are generally associated with monthly or annual subscription based services where an advertiser pays a fixed amount to be included in our index of listings or our distribution partners index of listings 
revenues from these subscription arrangements are recognized ratably over the service period 
outsourced search marketing platforms we generate revenue from reseller partners and publishers utilizing our web based technologies 
we are paid a management or agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made by the advertiser 
the partners or publishers engage the advertisers and are the primary obligor  and we  in certain instances  are only financially liable to the publishers in our capacity as a collection agency for the amount collected from the advertisers 
we recognize revenue for these fees under the net revenue recognition method 
in limited arrangements resellers pay us a fee for fulfilling an advertiser s campaign in our distribution network and we act as the primary obligor 
we recognize revenue for these fees under the gross revenue recognition method 
industry and market factors we enter into agreements with various distribution partners to provide distribution for the url strings and advertisement listings of our advertisers 
we generally pay distribution partners based on a percentage of revenue or a fixed amount per click through or for each phone call on these listings 
the level of click throughs and phone calls contributed by our distribution partners has varied  and we expect it will continue to vary  from quarter to quarter and year to year  sometimes significantly 
if we do not add new distribution partners  renew our current distribution partner agreements or replace traffic lost from terminated distribution agreements with other sources or if our distribution partners search businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to grow will be impacted by our ability to increase our distribution  which impacts the number of internet users who have access to our advertisers listings and the rate at which our advertisers are able to convert clicks and calls from these internet users into completed transactions  such as a purchase or sign up 
our ability to grow also depends on our ability to continue to increase the number of advertisers who use our services and the amount these advertisers spend on our services 
we anticipate that these variables will fluctuate in the future  affecting our ability to grow and our financial results 
in particular  it is difficult to project the number of click throughs or phone calls we will deliver to our advertisers and how much advertisers will spend with us  and it is even more difficult to anticipate the average revenue per click through or phone call 
it is also difficult to anticipate the impact of worldwide economic conditions on advertising budgets  including due to the economic uncertainty resulting from recent disruptions in global financial markets 

table of contents in addition  we believe we will experience seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonal fluctuations in levels of internet usage and seasonal purchasing cycles of many advertisers 
it is generally understood that during the spring and summer months  internet usage is lower than during other times of the year  especially in comparison to the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
the extent to which usage may decrease during these off peak periods is difficult to predict 
prolonged or severe decreases in usage during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results 
additionally  the current business environment has generally resulted in advertisers and reseller partners reducing advertising and marketing services budgets  which we expect will impact our quarterly results of operations in addition to the typical seasonality seen in our industry 
service costs our service costs represent the cost of providing our performance based advertising services and our search marketing services 
the service costs that we have incurred in the periods presented primarily include user acquisition costs  amortization of intangible assets  license and content fees  credit card processing fees  network operations  serving our search results  telecommunication costs  including provisioning of telephone numbers  maintaining our web sites  domain name registration renewal fees  network fees  fees paid to outside service providers  delivering customer service  depreciation of our web sites  network equipment and internally developed software  colocation service charges of our web site equipment  bandwidth and software license fees  payroll and related expenses of related personnel  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
user acquisition costs for the periods presented the largest component of our service costs consist of user acquisition costs that relate primarily to payments made to distribution partners for access to their online user traffic 
we enter into agreements of varying durations with distribution partners that integrate our services into their web sites and indexes 
the primary economic structure of the distribution partner agreements is a variable payment based on a specified percentage of revenue 
these variable payments are often subject to minimum payment amounts per click through or phone call 
other payment structures that to a lesser degree exist include fixed payments  based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered  
table of contents variable payments based on a specified metric  such as number of paid click throughs or phone calls  and a combination arrangement with both fixed and variable amounts that may be paid in advance 
we expense user acquisition costs based on whether the agreement provides for fixed or variable payments 
agreements with fixed payments with minimum guaranteed amounts of usage are expensed as the greater of the pro rata amount over the term of arrangement or the actual usage delivered to date based on the contractual revenue share 
agreements with variable payments based on a percentage of revenue  number of paid click throughs  phone calls or other metrics are expensed as incurred based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed upon price or rate 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales functions  advertising and promotional expenditures including online and outside marketing activities  cost of systems used to sell to and serve advertisers  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
product development product development costs consist primarily of expenses incurred in the research and development  creation and enhancement of our web sites and services 
our research and development expenses include payroll and related expenses for personnel  costs of computer hardware and software  costs incurred in developing features and functionality of the services we offer  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
for the periods presented  substantially all of our product development expenses are research and development 
product development costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment in accordance with fasb asc previously the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement requires that costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  professional services  including accounting  legal and insurance  bad debt provisions  
table of contents facilities costs  other general corporate expenses  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
stock based compensation we follow fasb asc previously financial accounting standards board s fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment and account for stock based compensation under the fair value method 
as a result  stock based compensation consists of the following all share based compensation arrangements granted after january  adoption date of fasb asc and for any such arrangements that are modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date  and the portion of previous share based awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of january  stock based compensation expense has been included in the same lines as compensation paid to the same employees in the consolidated statement of operations in accordance with sec accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
amortization of intangibles from acquisitions amortization of intangible assets excluding goodwill relates to intangible assets identified in connection with our acquisitions 
the intangible assets have been identified as non competition agreements  trade and internet domain names  distributor relationships  advertising relationships  patents  and acquired technology 
these assets are amortized over useful lives ranging from to months 
provision for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
each reporting period we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from available carrybacks or future taxable income  and to the extent that realization is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
although 
table of contents realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not  based on operating performance  available carrybacks and projections of future taxable income  that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
in determining that it was more likely than not that we would realize the deferred tax assets  factors considered included historical taxable income  historical trends related to advertiser usage rates  projected revenues and expenses  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our other assets 
the majority of our deferred tax assets are from goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with various acquisitions that are tax deductible over year periods 
based on available carrybacks and projections of future taxable income  the company expects to be able to recover these assets 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in increases to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense of up to the entire net amount of deferred tax assets 
from time to time  various state  federal  and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake reviews of us and our filings 
we believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to the financial statements 
as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of million  relating to the impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangibles assets  net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary differences 
as of december   based upon both positive and negative evidence available  we have determined it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards in state and foreign jurisdictions will be realizable and accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance of million against these deferred tax assets 
should we determine in the future that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  or not be able to realize all or part of our remaining net deferred tax assets recorded as of december   an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would impact net income or stockholders equity in the period such determination was made 
as of december  and  we had federal net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of million which will begin to expire in the tax reform act of limits the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
we believe that such a change has occurred  and that approximately million of nol carryforwards is limited such that substantially all of these federal nol carryforwards will never be available 
accordingly  we have not recorded a deferred tax asset for these nol s 
as of december  and  we had certain tax effected state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not have a history of taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions and the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not expire unutilized 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance on the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december  convertible preferred stock during and  the company s board of directors declared the following quarterly dividends on the company s convertible exchangeable preferred stock approval date per share dividend date of record total amount in thousands payment date january february  february  april may  may  july august  august  october november  november  january february  february  april may  may  july august  august

revenue 
the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  for the periods presented years ended december  partner and other revenue sources publishing network total revenue to our partner network revenues are primarily generated using third party distribution networks to deliver the advertisers listings 
the distribution network includes search engines  shopping engines  directories  destination sites  third party internet domains or web sites  other targeted web based content  mobile and offline sources 
we generate revenue upon delivery of qualified and reported click throughs or phone calls to our advertisers or to advertising services providers listings 
we pay a revenue share to the distribution partners to access their online user traffic 
other revenues include our call provisioning and call tracking services  campaign management services  natural search optimization services and outsourced search marketing platforms 
our publishing network revenues are generated from our portfolio of owned web sites which are monetized with pay per click listings that are relevant to the web sites  as well as other forms of advertising  including call based ad units  banner advertising and sponsorships 
when an online user navigates to one of our web sites and clicks on a particular listing or completes the specified action  we receive a fee 
revenue decreased  from million in to million in the decrease in partner network and other revenues was primarily attributable to a more than million decrease in pay per click revenues due in part to approximately  fewer advertisers spending on our partner network and lower advertiser spend budgets 
additionally there was a million decrease attributable to less traffic volume from domain name owners who are distribution partners utilizing our third party content platform  including a net decline of less than distribution partners comparing the year ended december  to the same period ended in these decreases were partially offset by our adding more than million in revenue from our private label suite of products for small and medium sized businesses and call based advertising services during this period which were primarily attributable to an increase in the revenues we generated from advertisers utilizing our private label suite of products and call based advertising services 
publishing network revenue decreased primarily due to million lower revenues from our arrangement with yahoo whereby we receive payment upon click throughs on pay per click listings presented on our web sites 
this decrease was principally due to fewer click throughs on pay per click listings from yahoo the remainder of such decrease was largely due to lower revenues for cost per actions from resellers such as at t  dex one corporation  supermedia inc  yellowbook usa inc  whitepages  inc  vantage media  llc and intelius  inc  particularly related to our local search and directory web sites 
the year ended december  was also impacted by million of revenue we did not recognize for services  in part because of limited 
table of contents collectability assurance from certain advertiser resellers  including due to the bankruptcy filings of supermedia and dex one 
under our arrangement with at t  we generate revenues from our private label suite of products for small and medium sized businesses to sell search marketing packages and or call advertising packages through their existing sales channels  which are then fulfilled by us across our distribution network 
we are paid account fees and also agency fees for our products in the form of a percentage of the cost of every click or call delivered to their advertisers 
at t and yahoo in accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues compared to and  respectively  in as noted above  revenues from supermedia and intelius are primarily related to our local search and directory web sites and revenues decreased from million and million  respectively  in  to million and million  respectively  in our arrangement with intelius expires at the end of march and there are no assurances we will be able to renew or extend the arrangement 
effective december  yahoo discontinued its feed management service relationship with us as a result of its recently announced partnership with microsoft 
accordingly  we discontinued our feed management service offering as of that date 
we generated million in revenues from this service and related feed management services in the impact on our financial statements attributable to our ending this service will be lessened by the relatively low operating margin attributable to this service given our revenue share arrangement with yahoo with respect thereto 
excluding feed management services  unless economic conditions deteriorate further  in the near term we expect advertisers and resellers to have relatively stable advertising and marketing service budgets compared to the fourth quarter of to revenue increased  from million in to million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to publishing network sources  including our portfolio of more than  web sites 
the majority of the revenues from our publishing network sources are attributable to the name development  pike street and areaconnect portfolios of web sites 
substantially all of the publishing network revenue increase was attributable to an increase in the average revenue per advertiser 
revenues from our arrangement with yahoo whereby we receive payment upon click throughs on pay per click listings presented on our web sites decreased in  in part as we experienced more demand and revenue growth for cost per actions from reseller partners such as at t  dex one  supermedia  yellowbook usa inc  the cobalt group  whitepages  inc  vantage media  llc and intelius  inc  particularly related to our local search and directory web sites 
the partner network and other revenues were affected by our adding more than  accounts to our private label suite of products for small and medium sized businesses and call based advertising platforms which were primarily attributable to an increase of million in the revenues we generated from reseller partners related to our private label suite of products for small and medium sized businesses and call based advertising services 
these revenue increases were offset by a million decrease attributable to less traffic volume from domain name owners who are distribution partners utilizing our third party content platform including a net decline of fifteen distribution partners from domain name owners comparing the year ended december  to the same period ended in a portion of the decrease was also attributable to lower pay per click revenues due in part to more than  fewer advertisers spending on our partner network 
our ability to maintain and grow our revenues will depend in part on maintaining and increasing the number of click throughs and calls performed by users of our service through our distribution partners and proprietary traffic sources and maintaining and increasing the number and volume of transactions and favorable variable payment terms with advertisers and advertising services providers  which we believe is dependent in part on marketing our web sites and delivering high quality traffic that ultimately results in purchases or conversions for our advertisers and advertising services providers 
we may increase our direct monetization of our proprietary 
table of contents traffic sources which may not be at the same rate levels as other advertising providers and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
if we do not add new distribution partners  renew our current distribution partner agreements or replace traffic lost from terminated distribution agreements with other sources or if our distribution partners businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
if revenue grows and the volume of transactions and traffic increases  we will need to expand our network infrastructure 
inefficiencies in our network infrastructure to scale and adapt to higher traffic volumes could materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
we anticipate that these variables will fluctuate in the future  affecting our growth rate and our financial results 
in particular  it is difficult to project the number of click throughs and phone calls we will deliver to our advertisers and how much advertisers will spend with us  and it is even more difficult to anticipate the average revenue per click through or phone call 
it is also difficult to anticipate the impact of worldwide economic conditions on advertising budgets due to the evolving market conditions

the decrease as a percentage of revenue in service costs as compared to was primarily a result of a larger proportion of revenue from proprietary traffic sources for which there are no related distribution partner payments 
we expect that user acquisition costs and revenue shares to distribution partners are likely to increase prospectively given the competitive landscape for distribution partners 
to the extent that payments to pay per click services  pay for call or cost per action distribution partners make up a larger percentage of future operations  or the addition or renewal of existing distribution partner agreements are on terms less favorable to us  we expect that service costs will increase as a percentage of revenue 
to the extent of revenue declines in these areas  we expect revenue shares to distribution partners to decrease in absolute dollars 
our publishing network sources have a lower service cost as a percentage of revenue relative to our overall service cost percentage 
our publishing network sources have no corresponding distribution partner payments 
to the extent our publishing network sources make up a larger percentage of our future operations  we expect that service costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue 
we also expect that in the longer term service costs will increase in absolute dollars as a result of costs associated with the expansion of our operations and network infrastructure as we scale and adapt to increases in the volume of transactions and traffic and invest in our platforms 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses were and for and  respectively 
the net decrease in dollars was related primarily to a decrease in online and outside marketing activities 
although online and outside marketing activities have been lower  we expect some volatility in sales and marketing expenses in the near term based on the timing of marketing initiatives and therefore such expenses may be higher in absolute dollars 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in connection with any revenue increase to the extent that we also increase our marketing activities and correspondingly could increase as a percentage of revenue 
we also expect fluctuations in marketing expenditures as we redirect our online marketing efforts towards more of our updated web sites and direct monetization of our proprietary traffic sources but expect expenditures related to these efforts to increase in absolute dollars in the long term 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses were and for and  respectively 
the increase of million was related primarily to an increase in online and outside marketing activities due in part 
table of contents to our rebranding efforts during the year  additional demand for our local search and directory web site traffic and additional personnel costs 
product development 
product development expenses decreased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  product development expenses were and for and  respectively 
the decrease in dollars was primarily due to a decrease in fees paid to outside service providers  stock compensation and personnel costs of million 
the increase as a percentage of revenue in product development expense as compared to was primarily a result of an increase in the proportion of personnel costs relative to revenue 
in the near term  we do not expect significant changes to our product development expenditures 
in the longer term  we expect that product development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase the number of personnel and consultants to enhance our service offerings and as a result of additional stock based compensation expense 
product development expenses increased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  product development expenses were and for and  respectively 
the increase in dollars was primarily due to an increase in consulting  personnel  including stock based compensation costs of million  and the remaining increase of  was related to travel  depreciation and amortization  and other operating costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs  bad debt  stock based compensation  fees paid to outside service providers  depreciation and other costs of million 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were and for and  respectively 
we do not expect significant changes to our general and administrative expenses in the near term 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the longer term to the extent that we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with being a public company  including expenses related to professional fees and insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased  from million in to million in the increase in dollars was primarily due to an increase in personnel and consulting costs of million  an increase in travel  facility costs  bad debt  business taxes and other costs of  partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation of  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were for both and amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions 
intangible amortization expense decreased  from million in to million in the decrease was associated with certain intangible assets from acquisitions being fully amortized in and intangible amortization expense decreased  from million in to million in the decrease was related to certain of our intangible assets being fully amortized partially offset by an increase related to the marchex voice services acquisition in during  the components of amortization of intangibles were service costs of million  sales and marketing of million and general and administrative of  all assets and liabilities obtained in our acquisitions were recorded at their estimated fair values on their respective acquisition dates 
the identified intangibles amounted to million  aggregate acquisition fair value as of december   and are being amortized over a range of useful lives of to months 
we may acquire identifiable intangible assets as part of future acquisitions  and if so  we expect that our intangible amortization will increase in absolute dollars 
events and circumstances considered in determining whether the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a significant decline in the company s stock price 
table of contents and or market capitalization for a sustained period of time 
at various points during the year ended december   our stock price approached or dropped below the then book value per share 
if the our stock price were to trade below book value per share for an extended period of time and or we experienced downward trends in the overall economic environment and or changes in the business itself  including changes in projected earnings and cash flows  we may need to recognize an impairment of all or some portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment testing in accordance with fasb asc previously sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of this testing  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge on goodwill 
the impairment charge resulted in part from adverse equity and credit market conditions that caused a sustained decrease in current market multiples and our stock price  a decrease in valuations of us public companies and corresponding increased costs of capital created by the weakness in the us financial markets and decreases in cash flow forecasts for the markets where we operate 
no impairment of significance of goodwill has been identified in impairment of intangible assets

with respect to a significant portion of our pay per click and call based advertising services  we have no corresponding payments to distribution partners related to our proprietary revenues or we receive payment from advertisers prior to our delivery of related click throughs or phone calls with the corresponding payments to the distribution partners who provide placement for the listings generally made only after our delivery of a click through or phone call 
in most cases  the amount payable to the distribution partner will be calculated at the end of a calendar month  with a payment period following the delivery of the click throughs or phone calls 
this payment structure results in a lag period between the earlier receipt of the cash from the advertisers and the later payment to the distribution partners 
these services constituted the majority of revenue in  and in certain cases  payments to distribution partners are paid in advance or are fixed in advance based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered 
nearly all of the feed management services and advertising services provider arrangements are billed on a monthly basis following the month of our click through delivery 
this payment structure results in our advancement of monies to the distribution partners who have provided the corresponding placements of the listings 
for these services  advertiser s payments are generally received one to three weeks following payment to the distribution partners 
we expect that in the future periods  if the amounts from our advertising services provider arrangements account for a greater percentage of our operating activity  working capital requirements will increase as a result 

table of contents we have payment arrangements with reseller partners particularly related to our proprietary traffic sources or local online advertising platforms  such as at t  dex one corporation  supermedia inc  yellowbook usa inc  the cobalt group  whitepages  inc  vantage media llc and intelius  inc  whereby we receive payment between and days following the delivery of services 
for the year and as of december  amounts from these partners along with yahoo totaled of revenue and million in accounts receivable  respectively 
based on the timing of payments  we generally have this level of amounts in outstanding accounts receivable at any given time from these partners 
there can be no assurances that these partners or other advertisers will not experience further financial difficulty  curtail operations  reduce or eliminate spend budgets  delay payments or otherwise forfeit balances owed 
net accounts receivable balances outstanding at december  from yahoo  at t  supermedia and intelius totaled million  million   and  respectively 
supermedia and dex one and its subsidiaries have recently consummated reorganizations under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
supermedia and dex one accounted for million and million of revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  we did not recognize an aggregate of million in revenue related to services delivered to supermedia and dex one in light of collectibility considerations for the year ended december  and we do not presently anticipate recognizing such revenue in the future based on the terms of their plans of reorganization 
the extent of our future business relationships with supermedia and dex one is uncertain

to the extent our operations increase  we expect to increase expenditures for our systems and personnel 
additionally  we have expended amounts for product development initiatives as well as amounts recorded as part of property and equipment for internally developed software 
we expect our expenditures for product development initiatives and internally developed software will increase in the longer term in absolute dollars as our development activities accelerate and we increase the number of personnel and consultants to enhance our service offerings 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of approximately million was primarily attributable to the repurchase of million shares of class b common stock for treasury stock totaling approximately million  and common stock dividend payments of million  partially offset by net proceeds of approximately  from the sale of stock through employee stock options and employee stock plan purchases and  of excess tax benefits related to stock options

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total less than year years years thereafter contractual obligations operating leases capital leases other contractual obligations total contractual obligations in february we entered into a license agreement with an advertising partner which provides for a contingent royalty based on a discounted rate of under certain circumstances of certain of our gross revenues payable on a quarterly basis through december the royalty payment is recognized as incurred in service costs and is not included in the above schedule 
our tax contingencies are not included due to their uncertainty 
during and  we paid approximately  and  respectively  for the purchase of additional internet domains or web sites 
in the near term  we do not expect significant cash outlays for internet domains although we do expect some outlays as we expect to continue acquiring internet domains or web sites in the normal course of business as we grow our proprietary network of web sites 
we anticipate that we will need to invest working capital towards the development and expansion of our overall operations 
we may also make a significant number of acquisitions  which could result in the reduction of our cash balances or the incurrence of debt 
on april   we entered into a three year credit agreement which provides us with a million senior secured revolving credit line  which may be used for various corporate purposes including financing permitted acquisitions  subject to compliance with applicable covenants 
as of december   we had no borrowings under the credit agreement 
furthermore  we expect that capital expenditures may increase in future periods  particularly if our operating activity increases 
in november  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to million shares of our class b common stock as well as the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend for the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock 
in february  our board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program to provide for the repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of our class b common stock 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program for the company to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of the company s class b common stock 
in december  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program for the company to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of the company s class b common stock 
in february  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program for the company to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of the company s class b common stock 
in december  the company s board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program for the company to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of the company s class b common stock 
under the revised share repurchase program  repurchases may take place in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions and at times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  capital availability  and other market conditions 
this share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be expanded  limited or 
table of contents terminated at any time without prior notice 
during the year ended december   approximately million shares of class b common stock were repurchased under the share repurchase program 
during the year ended december   approximately million shares of class b common stock were repurchased under the share purchase program 
in  we have repurchased approximately million of class b common stock to date 
the quarterly cash dividend was initiated at per share of class a common stock and class b common stock 
quarterly dividends were paid on february   may   august  and november  to class a and class b common stockholders of record as of the close of business on february   may   august  and november   respectively 
for  quarterly dividends were paid on february  may  august and november to class a and class b common stockholders of record as of the close of business of february  may  august and november  respectively 
total dividends paid in were approximately million 
although we expect that the annual cash dividend  subject to capital availability  will be per common share or approximately million for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at such a rate or at all 
under delaware law  dividends to stockholders may be made only from the surplus of a company  or  in certain situations  from the net profits for the current fiscal year before the dividend is declared by the board of directors 
based on our operating plans we believe that existing resources and cash flow provided by ongoing operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months 
additional equity and debt financing may be needed to support our acquisition strategy  our long term obligations and our company s needs 
if additional financing is necessary  it may not be available  and if it is available  it may not be possible for us to obtain financing on satisfactory terms 
failure to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve our intended business objectives 
critical accounting policies the policies below are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies relate to the following matters and are described below revenue  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  advertiser and incentive program credits  and provision for income taxes 
revenue we currently generate revenue through our operating businesses by delivering call and click based advertising products that enable advertisers of all sizes to reach local consumers across online  mobile and offline sources 
the primary revenue driver has been performance based advertising  which includes pay per click 
table of contents advertising  call based advertising services  cost per action services and feed management and related services 
for pay per click advertising  pay for call and feed management and related services  revenue is recognized upon our delivery of qualified and reported click throughs or phone calls to our advertisers or advertising service providers listing which occurs when an online  offline or mobile user clicks on or makes a phone call based on any of their advertisements after it has been placed by us or by our distribution partners 
each click through or phone call on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction 
for cost per action services  revenue is recognized when the online user is redirected from one of our web sites or a third party web site in our distribution network to an advertiser web site and completes the specified action  such as when a call is placed 
in certain cases  we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties 
collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owing that occurs subsequent to period ends 
we have entered into agreements with various distribution partners in order to expand our distribution network  which includes search engines  directories  product shopping engines  third party vertical and branded web sites  mobile and offline sources  and our portfolio of owned web sites  on which we include our advertisers listings 
we generally pay distribution partners based on a specified percentage of revenue or a fixed amount per click through or phone call on these listings 
we act as the primary obligor in these transactions  and we are responsible for providing customer and administrative services to the advertiser 
in accordance with fasb asc previously emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the revenue derived from advertisers who receive paid introductions through us as supplied by distribution partners is reported gross based upon the amounts received from the advertiser 
we also recognize revenue for certain agency contracts with advertisers under the net revenue recognition method 
under these specific agreements  we purchase listings on behalf of advertisers from search engines and directories 
we are paid account fees and also agency fees based on the total amount of the purchase made on behalf of these advertisers 
under these agreements  our advertisers are primarily responsible for choosing the publisher and determining pricing  and the company  in certain instances  is only financially liable to the publisher for the amount collected from our advertisers 
this creates a sequential liability for media purchases made on behalf of advertisers 
in certain instances  the web publishers engage the advertisers directly and we are paid an agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made by the advertiser 
in limited arrangements resellers pay us a fee for fulfilling an advertiser s campaign in our distribution network and we act as the primary obligor 
we recognize revenue for these fees under the gross revenue recognition method 
we apply fasb asc previously eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to account for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
fasb asc addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
when an arrangement involves multiple elements  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
we apply the provisions of fasb asc previously sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc fasb asc also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with fasb asc previously sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset sfas 
table of contents goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
events and circumstances considered in determining whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in the company s stock price and or market capitalization for a sustained period of time 
if our stock price were to trade below book value per share for a extended period of time and or we continue to experience adverse effects of a continued downward trend in the overall economic environment  changes in the business itself  including changes in projected earnings and cash flows  we may have to recognize an impairment of all or some portion of our goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  a material impairment charge may be reported in our financial results 
we exercise judgment in the assessment of the related useful lives of intangible assets  the fair values and the recoverability 
in certain instances  the fair value is determined in part based on cash flow forecasts and discount rate estimates 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
to the extent such evaluation indicates that the useful lives of intangible assets are different than originally estimated  the amortization period is reduced or extended and  accordingly  amortization expense is increased or decreased 
recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment is to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing in accordance with fasb asc and in light of the then adverse macroeconomic environment and significant decrease in market capitalization 
we also performed a review on certain of our intangible assets under fasb asc as a result of this testing  we recorded million pre tax impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the impairment charge resulted in part from adverse equity and credit market conditions that caused a sustained decrease in market multiples and the company s stock price  a decrease in valuations of us public companies and corresponding increased costs of capital created by the weakness in the us financial markets and decreases in cash flow forecasts for us and the markets in which we operate 
certain technology and domain assets were written down due to the decreased cash flow forecasts and planned utilization of the assets 
the impairment charges will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
no impairment of significance of our intangible assets has been identified in the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions 
to the extent that changes in the current business environment impact our ability to achieve levels of forecasted operating results and cash flows  or should other events occur indicating the remaining carrying value of our assets might be impaired  we would test our intangible assets for impairment and may recognize an additional impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds such asset s fair value 
any future additional impairment charges or changes to the estimated amortization periods could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation fasb asc requires the measurement and recognition of compensation for all stock based awards made to employees  non employees and directors including stock options and restricted stock issuances based on 
table of contents estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for stock based awards 
our determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected life of the award  our expected stock price  volatility over the term of the award and actual and projected exercise behaviors 
although the fair value of stock based awards is determined in accordance with fasb asc  the assumptions used in calculating fair value of stock based awards and the black scholes option pricing model are highly subjective  and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised and cancelled 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note c stock option plan in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser and incentive program credits accounts receivable balances are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser credits 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable 
we determine our allowance based on analysis of historical bad debts  advertiser concentrations  advertiser creditworthiness and current economic trends 
we review the allowance for collectibility on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential recovery is considered remote 
if the financial condition of our advertisers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimated the allowances required  additional allowances may be required which would result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination was made 
we determine our allowance for advertiser credits and adjustments based upon our analysis of historical credits 
under the advertiser incentive program  we grant advertisers credits depending upon the individual amounts of prepayments made 
the incentive program allowance is determined based on the historical rate of incentives earned and used by advertisers compared to the related revenues recognized by us 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments and estimates 
provision for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
each reporting period we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from available carrybacks or future taxable income  and to the extent that realization is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
although 
table of contents realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not  based on operating performance  available carrybacks and projections of future taxable income  that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
in determining that it was more likely than not that we would realize the deferred tax assets  factors considered included historical taxable income  historical trends related to advertiser usage rates  projected revenues and expenses  macroeconomic conditions  issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our other assets 
the majority of our deferred tax assets have arisen due to deductions taken in our financial statements related to the impairment of goodwill and amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with various acquisitions that are tax deductible over year periods 
based on available carrybacks and projections of future taxable income the company expects to be able to recover these assets 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in increases to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense of up to the entire net amount of deferred tax assets 
from time to time  various state  federal  and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake reviews of us and our filings 
we believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to the financial statements

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the our tax return 
fasb asc also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of million  relating to the impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangibles assets  net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary differences 
as of december   based upon both positive and negative evidence available  we have determined it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards in state and foreign jurisdictions will be realizable and accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance of million against these deferred tax assets 
should we determine in the future that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  or not be able to realize all or part of our remaining net deferred tax assets recorded as of december   an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would impact net income or stockholders equity in the period such determination was made 
as of december  and  we had federal net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of million which will begin to expire in the tax reform act of limits the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
we believe that such a change has occurred  and that approximately million of nol carryforwards is limited such that substantially all of these federal nol carryforwards will never be available 
accordingly  we have not recorded a deferred tax asset for these nol s 
as of december  and  we had certain tax effected state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not have a history of taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not expire unutilized 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance on the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term  money market funds 
we place our investments with high quality financial institutions 
during the years ended december  and  the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our investments and our earnings were not material 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our investments and our earnings from a hypothetical change in interest rates would not be significant 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
our existing credit facility bears interest at a rate which will be  at our option  either i the applicable margin rate depending on our leverage plus the one month libor rate reset daily  or ii the applicable margin rate plus the    or month libor rate 
this facility is exposed to market rate fluctuations and may impact the interest paid on any borrowings under the credit facility 
currently  we have no borrowings under this facility  however  an increase in interest rates would impact interest expense on future borrowings
