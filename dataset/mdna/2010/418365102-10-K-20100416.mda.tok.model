table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview hastings is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that buys  sells  trades and rents various home entertainment products  including books  music  software  periodicals  new and used cds  dvds  video games  video game consoles and electronics 
we also offer consumables and trends products such as apparel  t shirts  action figures  posters  greeting cards and seasonal merchandise through our entertainment stores and our internet web site 
as of march   we operated stores averaging approximately  square feet in medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the stores  operated on leased premises  is wholly owned by us and is operated under the name of hastings 
our operating strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding and remodeling existing stores  opening new stores in selected markets and offering our products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates comprise our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed  and any required adjustments are recorded  on a monthly or quarterly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record the lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated market value and returnability of merchandise inventory by product category and record an adjustment if estimated market value is below cost 
rental asset depreciation 
we have established rental asset depreciation policies that match rental product costs with the related revenues 
these policies require that we make significant estimates  based upon our experience  as to the ultimate amount and timing of revenue to be generated from our rental product 
we utilize an accelerated method of depreciation because it approximates the pattern of demand for the product  which is higher when the product is initially released by the studios for rental and declines over time 
in establishing salvage values for our rental product  we consider the sales prices and sales volume of our previously rented product and other used product 
we currently depreciate the cost of our rental assets on an accelerated basis over six months or nine months  except for rental assets purchased for the initial stock of a new store  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over months 
rental assets  which include dvds  books on cd and video games  are depreciated to salvage values ranging from to rental assets purchased for less than established salvage values are not depreciated 
we also review the carrying value of our rental assets to ensure that estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying value 
we periodically record adjustments to the value of previously rented product primarily for estimated obsolescence or excess product based upon changes in our original assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than our original estimates  additional adjustments  including adjustments to useful lives or salvage values  may be required 
we continually evaluate the estimates surrounding the useful lives and salvage values used in depreciating our rental assets 
changes to these 
table of contents estimates resulting from changes in consumer demand  changes in customer preferences or the price or availability of retail products may materially impact the carrying value of our rental assets and our rental margins 
the costs of rental product purchased pursuant to revenue sharing arrangements  which are recorded in rental cost of sales on the consolidated statements of earnings  typically include a lower initial product cost than traditional rental purchases with a certain percentage of the net rental revenues shared with studios over an agreed period of time 
any up front costs exceeding the designated salvage value are amortized on an accelerated basis and revenue sharing payments pursuant to the applicable arrangement are expensed as rental cost of sales as the related revenue is earned 
additionally  certain titles have performance guarantees 
we analyze titles that are subject to performance guarantees and recognize an estimated expense for under performing titles throughout the applicable period based upon our analysis of the estimated rental revenue shortfall 
we revise these estimates on a monthly basis  based on actual results 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate under performing stores on a quarterly basis to determine whether projected future cash flows over the remaining lease term are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the fixed asset investment in each individual store 
if projected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the fixed asset investment  an impairment charge is recognized if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of leasehold improvements as well as certain other property and equipment is subject to impairment write down 
income taxes 
in determining net income  we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for future income tax consequences that are attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their income tax bases 
we base the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on enacted tax rates that we expect will apply to taxable earnings in the year when we expect to settle or recover those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities on any change in income tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date 
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood  on a cumulative basis  of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
share based compensation 
determining the amount of share based compensation to be recorded in the statement of earnings requires us to develop estimates that are used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility is derived based upon our historical stock prices over the expected life of the option 
expected life of the option the estimate of an expected life is calculated based on historical data relating to grants  exercises and cancellations  as well as the vesting period and contractual life of the option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option 
our stock price volatility and expected option lives involve management s best estimates at that time  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes pricing model and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the vesting period of the option 
we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of options that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
in addition to stock options  we award restricted stock awards  including restricted stock units and performance based restricted stock awards 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the average of the opening and closing stock price on the day on which they are granted 
for performance based restricted stock 
table of contents awards  compensation expense is recognized if management deems it probable that the performance conditions will be met 
management must use its judgment to determine the probability that a performance condition will be met 
if actual results differ from management s assumptions  future results could be materially impacted 
gift card breakage revenue 
we sell gift cards through each of our stores and through our web site www 
gohastings 
com 
the gift cards we sell have no stated expiration dates or fees and are subject to potential escheatment rights in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
gift card liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue at the time of sale of such cards with the costs of designing  printing and distributing the cards recorded as expense as incurred 
historically  the liability was relieved and revenue was recognized only upon redemption of the gift cards 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had sufficient historical data to analyze gift card redemption patterns and a final determination of the escheatment laws applicable to our operations 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded approximately million of revenue for the estimated breakage on gift cards we previously issued and sold 
subsequent to the initial change in estimate related to gift card breakage  gift card breakage revenue is recognized as gift cards are redeemed  based upon an analysis of the aging and utilization of gift cards  our determination that the likelihood of future redemption is remote and our determination that such balances are not subject to escheatment laws applicable to our operations

use of non gaap financial measures the company is providing free cash flow  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  and adjusted operating income as supplemental non gaap financial measures regarding the company s operational performance

specifically  management uses these items to further its own understanding of the company s core operating performance  which management believes represents the company s performance in the ordinary  ongoing and customary course of its operations 
therefore  management excludes from core operating performance those items  such as those relating to restructuring  investing  stock based compensation expense and non cash activities that management does not believe are reflective of such ordinary  ongoing and customary activities 
the company believes that providing this information to its investors  in addition to the presentation of gaap financial measures  allows investors to see the company s financial results through the eyes of management 
the company further believes that providing this information allows investors to both better understand the company s financial performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance 
free cash flow management defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities for the period less purchases of property and equipment during the period

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations from the sale of merchandise and the rental of products  most of which is received in cash and cash equivalents

accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased approximately million during fiscal compared to an increase of million during fiscal  primarily as a result of a change in estimate surrounding our recognition of gift card breakage revenue and the irs audit 
merchandise inventories decreased approximately million during fiscal  compared to a decrease of million during fiscal primarily due the timing of merchandise returns resulting from lower inventory levels at the beginning of the period as compared to the prior year and a continued focus on inventory management 
merchandise inventories  net of trade payables  decreased approximately million for fiscal compared to a decrease of million during fiscal during fiscal  we estimate net cash provided by operations of approximately to million 
the expected decrease from fiscal net cash provided by operations to estimated fiscal net cash provided by operations results primarily from projected increases in the purchases of rental inventory during fiscal investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal purchases of property  equipment and improvements decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of planned reductions in our capital expenditures

the average rates of interest being charged under the facility for fiscal years ending january  and were and  respectively

total existing minimum operating lease commitments for fiscal years through was approximately million as of january  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we routinely enter into purchase commitments for various aspects of our operations  such as warehouse equipment and office equipment 
however  we do not believe that these commitments will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of january   other than operating leases and standby letters of credit  we had not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or third party guarantees  nor is it our business practice to do so

these agreements include minimum purchase requirements  based upon the box office results of the title  at a lower initial product cost as compared to non revenue sharing purchases 
in addition  these contracts require net rental revenues to be shared with the studios over an agreed period of time 
we have included amounts owed and an estimate of our contractual obligation under these agreements for performance guarantees and minimum purchase requirements for the period in which they can reasonably be estimated  which is approximately two months in the future 
although these contracts may extend beyond the estimated two month period  we cannot reasonably estimate these amounts due to the uncertainty of purchases that will be made under these agreements 
the amounts presented above do not include revenue sharing accruals for rental revenues that will be recognized during fiscal uncertain tax position obligations including unrecognized tax benefits of  and accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of  as of january   were not included in this table
