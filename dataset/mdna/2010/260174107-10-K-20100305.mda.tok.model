item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion is based upon and should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
we classify our revenues as admissions  event related  broadcasting and other

these expenses include prize and point fund monies and sanction fees paid to various sanctioning bodies  including nascar  labor  advertising  cost of goods sold for merchandise and souvenirs  and other expenses associated with the promotion of our racing events 
results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in we promoted fourteen major events during as compared to fifteen during the  decrease was primarily related to lower admissions revenue at our nascar event weekends at dover international speedway and to a lesser extent lower admissions at all other major events we promoted during we believe the decrease in attendance was attributable primarily to the general downturn in economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence and the rise in unemployment have increasingly contributed to the decrease in attendance 
inclement weather during the september nascar event weekend at dover international speedway also negatively impacted attendance 
additionally  the decrease was partially attributable to a change in our major motorsports event schedule 
the indy racing league event at our nashville superspeedway that we promoted during was not promoted in event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily related to lower sponsorship revenues at most events we promoted during and lower luxury suite rentals and concession sales at our nascar sprint cup series events at dover international speedway we believe as a result of the aforementioned economic conditions 
additionally  the decrease was partially attributable to the aforementioned change in our major motorsports event schedule 
broadcasting revenue increased slightly from  in to  in the increase resulted entirely from higher broadcasting revenue for our nascar sanctioned events promoted during operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the  decrease primarily related to cost savings initiatives implemented at all major events promoted in and a reduction in expenses due to the aforementioned lower revenues 
additionally  the decrease was partially attributable to the aforementioned change in our major motorsports event schedule 

table of contents based upon the expiration of the stock purchase agreement with gulf coast entertainment  llc  the sale of our memphis motorsports park facility was not completed  and as a result  we concluded in the third quarter of that it was necessary for us to review the carrying value of the long lived assets of our memphis facility for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded a  non cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our memphis facility to fair value 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly between and from  to  the decrease resulted primarily from cost saving initiatives 
depreciation and amortization expense was  in as compared to  in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in our depreciable asset base resulting from impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of and the cessation of depreciation expense at our memphis facility which was classified as held for sale for a portion of  partially offset by depreciation on assets placed in service in and related to our monster makeover project in dover  delaware 
net interest expense decreased to  in as compared to  in the decrease was due primarily to the reversal of  of previously recorded interest expense on certain unrecognized income tax benefits which are no longer subject to examination and to a lesser extent a lower average interest rate and lower average outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
excluding the interest expense we record on certain unrecognized income tax benefits  our net interest expense was  in as compared to  in loss on sale of investments was  in and related solely to losses on the sale of available for sale securities 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the change in our effective income tax rate from the prior year rate was primarily due to the changes in the mix of taxable income and losses within our various subsidiaries 
certain subsidiaries had state taxable income which resulted in state income tax expense  however  other subsidiaries with state tax losses have no state income tax benefits due to the valuation allowances that we have recorded in connection with state net operating loss carryforwards 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in we promoted fifteen major events during and the majority of the  decrease resulted from lower admissions revenue at our june and september nascar event weekends at dover international speedway 
we believe the decrease in attendance was attributable in part to the general downturn in economic conditions  including higher gas prices since most of our customers are from out of state  and inclement weather for the june event weekend 
event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  increase was primarily due to higher sponsorship revenues at the majority of our major events we promoted during and higher concession sales at our june nascar sprint cup series event at dover international speedway 
broadcasting revenue was  in as compared to  in the  increase resulted primarily from higher broadcasting revenue for our nascar sanctioned events promoted during partially offsetting this increase was a  decrease in ancillary media rights fees in operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the  decrease primarily related to lower sanction fees  advertising and promotional expenses and hospitality expenses at the major events promoted at our mid west facilities 
these decreases were partially offset by higher operating and marketing expenses at our june and september nascar event weekends at dover international speedway 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment charges of  as a result of our review of the long lived assets of each of our midwest facilities for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded non cash impairment charges of   and  to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our memphis  nashville and gateway facilities  respectively  to fair value 

table of contents general and administrative expenses remained consistent between and at  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense was  in as compared to  in the increase was due primarily to assets placed in service during the second quarter of and related to our monster makeover project in dover  delaware 
net interest expense remained consistent between and at  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate from the prior year rate was primarily the result of recording a valuation allowance against the state tax benefits associated with the non cash impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources our operations are seasonal in nature with a majority of our motorsports events occurring during the second and third quarters 
however  our cash flows from operating activities are more evenly spread throughout the year  primarily due to the impact of advance ticket sales and other event related cash receipts  such as sponsorship and luxury suite rentals 
the non cash impairment charges we recorded in the third quarter of and fourth quarter of had no impact on our liquidity for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in as compared to  in the decrease in was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings excluding non cash impairment charges 
net cash used in investing activities was  in as compared to  in capital expenditures were  in  down from  in the additions related primarily to the monster makeover project  consisting primarily of racetrack improvements at our dover facility 
the additions also related primarily to the monster makeover project  including the construction of a new entranceway  fan zone and medical center placed in service in the second quarter of  and the renovation and construction of other fan amenities at our dover facility 
increases in our restricted cash accounts were  and  for and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was  in as compared to  in we had net repayments on our outstanding line of credit of  in as compared to  in repayments of our outstanding swida bonds were  for as compared to  for we paid  in cash dividends in as compared to  in on july   our board of directors voted to suspend the declaration of regular quarterly cash dividends on all classes of our common stock 
dividends are prohibited by the most recent amendment to our credit facility 
we will consider the resumption of dividends in  if permitted by our lenders  after taking into consideration our financial performance and condition  our capital requirements  and general economic and industry conditions at such time 
at december   dover motorsports  inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries  as co borrowers  were parties to a  secured revolving credit agreement with a bank group 
the credit agreement is secured by all of our assets 
effective august   the credit facility was amended to revise certain financial covenants and interest rates  among other changes 
the maximum borrowing limit under the credit facility reduces to  on july  and the facility expires july  it provides for seasonal funding needs  capital improvements  letter of credit requirements and other general corporate purposes 
interest is based  at our option  upon libor plus basis points or the adjusted base rate 
the base rate is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points or the daily libor rate plus basis points 
the adjusted base rate is the greater of per annum or the base rate plus basis points 
the terms of the credit facility contain certain covenants including minimum tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  the credit agreement includes a material adverse change clause and prohibits the payment of dividends by us 
the credit facility also provides that if we default under any other loan 
table of contents agreement  that would be a default under this credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
material adverse changes in our results of operations could impact our ability to maintain financial ratios necessary to satisfy these requirements 
there was  outstanding under the credit facility at december   at a weighted average interest rate of 
after consideration of stand by letters of credit outstanding  the remaining maximum borrowings available pursuant to the credit facility were  at december   however  in order to maintain compliance with the required quarterly debt covenant calculations as of december  only  could have been borrowed as of that date 
based on projected future results  we expect to be in compliance with all of the covenants for all measurement periods during the next twelve months 
as previously discussed  on october  our board of directors approved the closing of the memphis facility 
nascar has approved the realignment of our nascar camping world truck series and nascar nationwide series events from memphis motorsports park to our nashville and gateway facilities  respectively 
we have been in discussions with several parties who have shown interest in buying the facility and we are currently evaluating all of our options relative to the memphis facility 
since it is our intention to sell the assets and liabilities of the memphis facility and we believe a sale will occur within the next twelve months  these assets and liabilities are being reported as held for sale as of december  cash provided by operating activities is expected to substantially fund our capital expenditures 
based on current business conditions  we expect to spend approximately  on capital expenditures during these expenditures primarily relate to our monster makeover project 
on may   we announced plans for a five year capital improvement project  referred to as the monster makeover  that will provide new offerings and upgraded amenities for fans  competitors and the media 
the project is expected to take approximately five years to complete at an estimated total cost of approximately  to  of which approximately  was spent as of december  we continue to review the amount and timing of capital expenditures in light of our current earnings level 
additionally  we expect to contribute approximately  to our pension plans for we expect continued cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit agreement to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements at least through the next twelve months and also provide for our long term liquidity 
contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments payments due by period total thereafter revolving line of credit swida bonds b total debt estimated interest payments on revolving line of credit a interest payments on swida bonds b operating leases pension contributions c total contractual cash obligations a the future interest payments on our revolving credit agreement were estimated using the current outstanding principal as of december  and related interest rates 
b in  midwest racing entered into an agreement with swida to receive the proceeds from the taxable sports facility revenue bonds  series gateway international motorsports corporation project  a municipal bond offering  in the aggregate principal amount of  of which  was outstanding at december  swida loaned all of the proceeds from the municipal bond offering to midwest racing for the purpose of the redevelopment  construction and expansion of gateway 
the proceeds of the swida bonds were irrevocably 
table of contents committed to complete construction of gateway  to fund interest  to create a debt service reserve fund and to pay for the cost of issuance of the bonds 
the repayment terms and debt service reserve requirements of the bonds issued in the municipal bond offering correspond to the terms of the swida bonds 
the bonds are being amortized through february we have established certain restricted cash funds to meet debt service as required by the swida bonds  which are held by the trustee bny trust company of missouri 
at december    of cash was restricted by the swida bonds and is classified as a non current asset in our consolidated balance sheet 
the restricted cash exceeds our total obligation for principal and interest payments on the swida bonds 
the swida bonds are secured by a first mortgage lien on all the real property owned and a security interest in all property leased by gateway 
also  the swida bonds are unconditionally guaranteed by midwest racing 
the swida bonds bear interest at a rate of 
c we expect to contribute approximately  to our pension plans for for years subsequent to  we are unable to estimate what our pension contributions will be 
in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  to acquire  construct and develop certain public infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding at december  annual principal payments range from  in september to  in and are payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  we would become responsible for the difference 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in us being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
in the event we were unable to make the payments  they would be made pursuant to a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by our bank group 
we believe that the sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility will continue to satisfy the necessary debt service requirements of the bonds through the maturity date in as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during  we paid  into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
if the debt service is not satisfied from the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility  a portion of the bonds would become our liability 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit that secures the bonds or we allow an uncured event of default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable 
we have not included our non current income taxes payable of  which is classified in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes  in the contractual obligations disclosure since we cannot reasonably estimate the period of potential cash settlement for unrecognized tax benefits

critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   our valuation allowance net of federal income taxes was  which increased by  in  on deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carry forwards 
these state net operating losses are related to our midwest facilities that in recent years have not produced taxable income 
in the event that our midwest facilities continue to generate losses for state income tax purposes in the future  our valuation allowance will increase to offset those income tax benefits 
we have considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
we perform reviews for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets other than goodwill are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
generally  fair value is determined using valuation techniques such as the comparable sales approach 
historically the impairment assessment for track facilities has also considered the cost approach valuation technique  which gives specific consideration to the value of the track land plus the contributory value to the improvements 
the primary economic assumptions used in the valuation techniques include i land value which is estimated by comparable transactions  ii the contributory value of the track facilities calculated by estimated replacement costs  less economic depreciation  and iii that the highest and best use for the facilities is as a race track due to the contributory value of the improvements 
changes to these assumptions can have a significant effect on the outcome of future impairment tests and as a result  future valuations could differ significantly from current estimates 
see note impairment charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
accrued pension cost the benefits provided by our defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and employee s remuneration over their employment with us 
accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for the discount rate  assumed rate of compensation increase  and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that we record in our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents factors that may affect operating results  forward looking statements this report and the documents incorporated by reference may contain forward looking statements 
in item a of this report  we disclose the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
at december   we did not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  hold any derivative financial instruments  nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we have marketable securities of  these securities  which consist of mutual funds  are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 
fair value is determined based on the current market values 
at december   there was  outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
the credit agreement bears interest at our option  upon libor plus basis points or the adjusted base rate 
the base rate is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points or the daily libor rate plus basis points 
the adjusted base rate is the greater of per annum or the base rate plus basis points 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
a change in interest rates of one percent on the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at december  would cause a change in total annual interest costs of  the borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at the variable rate described above and therefore approximate fair value at december  at december   our outstanding balance of the swida bonds had a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  the fair value was determined through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology applying interest rates which we believe would be available to us for issues with similar terms at december  in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  of which  was outstanding at december  these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  however  we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility
