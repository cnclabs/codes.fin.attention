introduction our company 
webmd health corp 
is a delaware corporation that was incorporated on may  we completed an initial public offering on september  our common stock trades under the symbol wbmd on the nasdaq global select market 
from the completion of our initial public offering through the completion of the merger on october   we were more than owned by hlth corporation which we refer to as hlth 
on october   stockholders of hlth and webmd approved the merger and the transaction was completed later that day  with hlth merging into webmd and webmd continuing as the surviving corporation 
webmd automatically succeeded to all of hlth s assets  liabilities and commitments upon completion of the merger other than the shares of webmd class b common stock owned by hlth which were cancelled in the merger 
in the merger  each share of hlth common stock was converted into shares of webmd common stock 
the shares of webmd s class a common stock were unchanged in the merger and continue to trade on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol wbmd  however  they are no longer referred to as class a because the merger eliminated both webmd s class b common stock and the dual class stock structure that had existed at webmd 
the key reasons for the merger 
table of contents included allowing hlth s stockholders to participate directly in the ownership of webmd  while eliminating hlth s controlling interest in webmd and the inefficiencies associated with having two separate public companies  increasing the ability of webmd to raise capital and to obtain financing  and improving the liquidity of webmd common stock by significantly increasing the number of shares held by public stockholders 
webmd was the only operating business of hlth at the time the merger closed 
accordingly  the completion of the merger did not have a significant effect on the operations of webmd since there were no hlth business operations to combine with webmd s business operations and  while hlth had previously been providing certain corporate services to webmd under a services agreement and had certain other agreements with webmd  those agreements ceased when webmd acquired hlth 
the employees and resources of hlth used to provide services to webmd under the services agreement became employees and resources of webmd upon completion of the merger 
basis of presentation  accounting treatment of the merger 
the applicable accounting treatment for the merger results in hlth being considered the acquiring entity of the webmd non controlling interest 
therefore  the pre acquisition consolidated financial statements of hlth became the historical financial statements of webmd following the completion of the merger 
for all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing income per common share have been adjusted by multiplying the historical weighted average shares outstanding for hlth by the exchange ratio in the merger 
additionally  basic and diluted income per common share have been recalculated to reflect the adjusted weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year periods presented 
for the year ended december   these adjustments only apply to the portion of the year prior to the completion of the merger on october  the consolidated accounts of hlth included  until the completion of the merger  of the assets and liabilities of webmd  which was more than owned by hlth until the merger 
the ownership interests of the noncontrolling stockholders of webmd are recorded as noncontrolling interest in the december  consolidated balance sheet included in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
in the consolidated statements of operations included in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report  net income attributable to company stockholders reflects an adjustment for the noncontrolling stockholders share of the net income of webmd until completion of the merger

table of contents background information on certain trends influencing the use of our services 
several key trends in the healthcare and internet industries are influencing the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing 
those trends are described briefly below use of the internet by consumers and physicians 
the internet has emerged as a major communications medium and has already fundamentally changed many sectors of the economy  including the marketing and sales of financial services  travel  and entertainment  among others 
the internet is also changing the healthcare industry and has transformed how consumers and physicians find and utilize healthcare information 
healthcare consumers increasingly seek to educate themselves online about their healthcare related issues  motivated in part by the continued availability of new treatment options and in part by the larger share of healthcare costs they are being asked to bear due to changes in the benefit designs being offered by health plans and employers 
the internet has fundamentally changed the way consumers obtain health and wellness information  enabling them to have immediate access to searchable information and dynamic interactive content to check symptoms  assess risks  understand diseases  find providers and evaluate treatment options 
according to a study of health information technology by the national center for health statistics of the centers for disease control and prevention or cdc  approximately of united states adults aged had used the internet to look up health information during the prior months  based on a survey conducted in the first half of according to a june study by the pew internet american life project  of us adults have searched for health information on the internet compared to in a similar study in and approximately of us adults have accessed social media related to health 
the internet has also become a primary source of information for physicians seeking to improve clinical practice and is growing relative to traditional information sources  such as conferences  meetings and offline journals 
increased online marketing and education spending for healthcare products 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them  however  only a small portion of this amount is currently spent on online services 
we believe that these companies  which comprise the majority of the advertisers and sponsors of our public portals  are becoming increasingly aware of the effectiveness of the internet relative to traditional media in providing health  clinical and product related information to consumers and physicians  and this increasing awareness will result in increasing demand for our services 
however  notwithstanding our general expectation for increased demand  our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including general economic conditions and the following the majority of our advertising and sponsorship contracts are for terms of approximately four to twelve months 
we have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship contracts 
the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that program may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals 
other factors that may affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors  or receipt of revenue under such contracts  include the timing of fda approval for new products or for new approved uses for existing products  the timing of fda approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products  the timing of withdrawals of products from the market  the timing of roll outs of new or enhanced services on our public portals  seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products  and the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals 

table of contents changes in health plan design  health management initiatives 
in a healthcare market where a greater share of the responsibility for healthcare costs and decision making has been increasingly shifting to consumers  use of information technology including personal health records to assist consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also increased 
we believe that through our webmd health and benefits manager tools  including our personal health record application  we are well positioned to play a role in this environment 
however  our strategy depends  in part  on increasing usage of our private portal services by our employer and health plan clients employees and members  respectively 
increasing usage of our services requires us to continue to deliver and improve the underlying technology and develop new and updated applications  features and services 
in addition  we face competition in the area of healthcare decision support tools and online health management applications and health information services 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do  and may be better known than we are 
we also expect that  for clients and potential clients in the industries most adversely affected by recent general economic conditions including those in the financial services and automotive industries  we may continue to experience some reductions in initial contracts  contract expansions and contract renewals for our private portal services  as well as reductions in the size of existing contracts 
developments in social media and other internet applications 
in the past several years  video and multimedia applications have become an increasingly important part of what users expect from internet sites 
in addition  consumers are increasingly using the internet to access social media as a means to communicate and exchange information  including regarding health and wellness 
similarly  physicians and other healthcare professionals are increasingly participating in condition or topic specific community groups and other interactive applications 
consumers and healthcare professionals are also increasingly using handheld devices to access the internet  with physicians increasingly using handheld devices in diagnosis and treatment at the point of care 
we have invested and intend to continue to invest in software and systems that allow us to meet the demands of our users and sponsors  including customized content management and publishing technology to deliver interactive content  multimedia programming and personalized health applications that engage our users 
the following are some of our recent and current initiatives to improve the user experience on our web sites  expand our services and increase our user base physician connect  our social networking platform for physicians  allows them to exchange information online on a range of topics  including patient care  drug information  healthcare related legislation and practice management 
physicians can also create polls to elicit tailored  constructive feedback from other physicians 
we also offer third parties the opportunity to sponsor physician connect discussions and polls so that they can gain insights into physicians perspectives and areas of interest 
by the end of  physician connect had attracted more than  physician members 
medscape from webmd also offers a variety of sponsored and unsponsored blogs where healthcare professionals can share their thoughts and opinions with the medscape from webmd community 
we plan to launch the webmd health exchange  a social networking initiative that will build on the hundreds of health communities that exist on webmd health today and will more closely integrate the social experience throughout each of our core content areas  in the webmd health exchange will give consumers the opportunity to explore a health or wellness topic on their own terms  by participating in webmd expert moderated communities or by creating their own public community or invitation only private community 
medscape mobile is a free medical application that can be accessed on the iphone tm and ipod touch

we are pursuing opportunities to expand the reach of our brands outside the united states 
in october  we launched our first major consumer portal outside the united states in partnership with boots  the uk s leading pharmacy led health and beauty retailer 
healthcare reform legislation 
congress is currently considering significant healthcare reform legislation 
healthcare reform legislation  if enacted  may increase governmental involvement in healthcare and health insurance  may change the way health insurance is funded including the role that employers play in such funding  may change reimbursement rates and other terms of such insurance coverage  may affect the way information technology is used in healthcare  and may otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate and the specific roles such participants play in the industry 
one important focus of healthcare reform is control of healthcare costs over the long term 
we believe that our services can play an important role in efforts to reduce healthcare costs 
accordingly  healthcare reform may create opportunities for us  including with respect to personal health record applications and health and benefits decision support tools and  more generally  with respect to our capabilities in providing health and wellness information and education 
however  we are unable to predict future legislation or proposals with any certainty or to predict the effect they could have on our business  and healthcare industry participants may respond to healthcare reform legislation or to the uncertainties created by potential legislation by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions  including expenditures for our services 
the healthcare industry in the united states and relationships among healthcare payers  providers and consumers are very complicated 
in addition  the internet and the market for online services are relatively new and still evolving 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our businesses from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors

directors officers liability insurance coverage litigation 
on july   hlth commenced litigation which we refer to as the coverage litigation in the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for new castle county against ten insurance companies in which hlth was seeking to compel the defendant companies which we refer to collectively as the defendants to honor their obligations under certain directors and officers liability insurance policies which we refer to as the policies 
webmd succeeded to hlth as plaintiff in this action as a result of the merger 
hlth was seeking an order requiring the defendants to advance and or reimburse expenses that hlth has incurred and expected to continue to incur for the advancement of the reasonable defense costs of initially ten  and now four  former officers and directors of the hlth s former eps subsidiary who were indicted in connection with the investigation by united states attorney for the district of south carolina which we refer to as the investigation described in note  commitments and contingencies located in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
pursuant to a stipulation among the parties  the coverage litigation was transferred on september  to the superior court of the state of delaware in and for new castle county 
the policies were issued to hlth and to eps  which is a co plaintiff with webmd in the coverage litigation which we refer to collectively as the plaintiffs 
eps was sold in september to sage software and has changed its name to sage software healthcare  inc which we refer to as sshi 
in connection with hlth s sale of eps to sage software  hlth retained certain obligations relating to the investigation and agreed to indemnify sage software and sshi with respect to certain expenses in connection with the investigation and we assumed those obligations as a result of the merger 
hlth retained and we succeeded to as a result of the merger the right to assert claims and recover proceeds under the policies on behalf of sshi 
prior to the filing of the second amended complaint which is discussed below  the policies at issue in the coverage litigation consisted of two separate groups of insurance policies 
each group of policies consists of several layers of coverage  with different insurers having agreed to provide specified amounts of coverage at various levels 
the first group of policies was issued to eps in the amount of  which we refer to as the eps policies and the second group of policies was issued to synetic  inc the former parent of eps  which merged into hlth in the amount of  of which approximately  was paid by the primary carrier with respect to another unrelated matter which we refer to as the synetic policies 
the carrier with the third level of coverage in the synetic policies filed a motion for summary judgment in the coverage litigation  which most of the carriers who have issued the synetic policies joined  which sought summary judgment that any liability to pay defense costs should be allocated among the three sets of policies available to us including the policies with respect to which the coverage litigation relates and a third set of policies the issuers of which had not yet been named by us such that the synetic policies would only be liable to pay about  of the  total coverage available under such policies 
hlth filed its opposition to the motion together with its motion for summary judgment against such carrier and several other carriers who have issued the synetic policies seeking to require such carriers to advance payment of the defense costs that we are obligated to pay while the coverage litigation is pending 
on july   the superior court for the state of delaware denied the motion filed by the carriers seeking allocation and granted hlth s motion for partial summary judgment to enforce the duty of such carriers to advance and reimburse these costs 
pursuant to the court s order  the issuers of the synetic policies have been reimbursing us for our costs as described above 

table of contents on september  and february   respectively  the eighth and ninth level carriers of the synetic policies notified hlth that they believe that they were not bound by the court s july  order regarding the duty of the synetic carriers to advance and reimburse defense costs 
this resulted in hlth making a motion to the court on february  to require such eighth and ninth level carriers to advance and reimburse defense costs 
hlth later settled with the eighth level carrier 
under the terms of the settlement such carrier will pay  in full and final settlement  an agreed upon percentage of the policy amount against each payment of defense costs made by us as such policy continues to be implicated 
on april   the ninth level carrier made a cross motion for summary judgment claiming that  in light of a policy endorsement applicable only to the ninth level carrier  because of the time period during which the conspiracy charged in the second superseding indictment is alleged to have taken place  the synetic policy issued by such carrier does not cover hlth s indemnification obligations 
hlth believed that such carrier s motion was without merit and responded to the motion 
on july   the court granted summary judgment in favor of the ninth level carrier and unless and until we successfully appeal such decision  the ninth level carrier is not liable to pay any portion of the  total coverage of its policy with respect to our indemnification obligations 
as of december    has been paid by insurance companies representing the eps policies and the synetic policies through a combination of payment under the terms of the policies  payment under reservation of rights or through settlement 
of this amount   represents the portion received through settlement 
on november   hlth filed a second amended complaint which added four new insurance companies as defendants in the coverage action 
these carriers are the issuers of a third set of policies which we refer to as the emdeon policies that provide coverage with respect to hlth s indemnification obligations to the former officers and directors of hlth s former eps subsidiary who were indicted in connection with the investigation 
all but one of the carriers who issued the emdeon policies moved for summary judgment asserting that exclusions in the emdeon policies preclude coverage for hlth s indemnification obligations and hlth filed motions seeking to compel such carriers to advance defense costs that hlth was obligated to indemnify 
on august   the court issued two opinions 
in the first opinion  the court granted summary judgment in favor of hlth with respect to one of the exclusions asserted by the carriers who issued the emdeon policies 
in the second opinion  the court granted summary judgment in favor of the carriers with respect to the other exclusion asserted by such carriers 
one of the carriers only joined in the first motion with respect to which hlth prevailed  although the policy issued by such carrier also contains language with respect to which the other carriers prevailed 
we have made a motion to compel such carrier to advance defense costs and also asking the court to rule that we have satisfied the  retention amount with respect to the emdeon policies and the court has stayed a ruling on this motion pending the outcome of the appeals to the supreme court of delaware discussed below 
the implication of these opinions  when considered together  is that unless and until we successfully appeal the second opinion described above  we have with the possible exception of the carrier who only joined in the motion regarding the first exclusion effectively exhausted our insurance with respect to our obligation to indemnify the indicted individuals 
we and the carriers who issued the emdeon policies with the exception of the second level carrier with whom we have settled have each appealed the trial court s august  rulings to the supreme court of delaware and the supreme court has agreed to hear both appeals  which have been consolidated 
the supreme court heard oral argument on both appeals on february  the insurance carriers assert that our insurance policies provide that under certain circumstances  amounts advanced by the insurance companies in connection with the defense costs of the indicted individuals may have to be repaid by us  although the amounts that we have received in settlement from certain carriers is not subject to being repaid 
we have obtained an undertaking from each indicted individual pursuant to which  under certain circumstances  such individual has agreed to repay defense costs advanced on such individual s behalf 
in addition to the coverage litigation  on december   tig specialty insurance company which we refer to as tig  the second level issuer of the eps policies commenced an action against us which we refer to as the tig action to recover the  that tig advanced to us in we have not yet answered the tig action but intend to vigorously defend our rights 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will ultimately prevail in the coverage litigation or the tig action or that the defendants in the coverage action will be required to provide funding on an interim basis pending the resolution of the coverage litigation 
we intend to continue to satisfy our legal obligations to the indicted individuals with respect to advancement of amounts for their defense costs 
indemnification obligations to former officers and directors of eps 
hlth had certain indemnity obligations to advance amounts for reasonable defense costs for initially ten  and now four  former officers and directors of eps  who were indicted in connection with the investigation 
in connection with the sale of eps  hlth agreed to indemnify sage software relating to these indemnity obligations and we also assumed that obligation in the merger 
during  based on information available at that time  we determined a reasonable estimate of the range of probable costs with respect to its indemnification obligation and accordingly  recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of  which represented our estimate of the low end of the probable range of costs related to this matter 
we reserved the low end of the probable range of costs because no estimate within the range was a better estimate than any other amount 
that estimate included assumptions as to the duration of the trial and pre trial periods  and the defense costs to be incurred during these periods 
during and we updated the estimated range of our indemnification obligation based on new information received during those periods  and as a result  recorded additional pre tax charges of  and  respectively 
the probable future costs with respect to this matter is estimated to be approximately  as of december  which includes costs that have been incurred prior to  but were not yet paid  as of december  the ultimate outcome of this matter is still uncertain  and the estimate of future costs includes assumptions as to the duration of the trial and the defense costs to be incurred during the remainder of the pre trial period and during the trial period 
accordingly  the amount of cost we may ultimately incur could be substantially more than the reserve we have currently provided 
if the recorded reserves are insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of this matter  we will need to record additional charges to our results of operations in future periods 
seasonality the timing of our revenue is affected by seasonal factors 
our public portal advertising and sponsorship revenue is seasonal  primarily due to the annual spending patterns of the advertising and sponsorship clients of our public portals 
this portion of our revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year  and increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year 
the timing of revenue in relation to our expenses  much of which do not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on cost of operations  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter 
critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting estimates our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the carrying value of prepaid advertising  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the amortization period of long lived assets excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the carrying value  capitalization and amortization of software and web site development costs  the carrying value of investments including investments in auction rate securities  the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts  certain accrued expenses  contingencies  litigation and related legal accruals and the value attributed to employee stock options and other stock based awards 
critical accounting policies we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered or as publications are distributed 
revenue from sponsorship arrangements  content syndication and distribution arrangements  information services and licenses of healthcare management tools and private portals as well as related health coaching services  are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from the sponsorship of cme is recognized over the period we substantially complete our contractual deliverables as determined by the applicable agreements 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
in certain instances where fair value does not exist for all the elements  the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered elements equals the total consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements 
in instances where fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized when the last element is delivered 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on fair value using exit price and market participant view  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell 
there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets noted as a result of our impairment testing in for any of our continuing operations 
fair value of investments in auction rate securities ars 
we hold investments in ars which are backed by student loans  guaranteed under the federal family education loan program ffelp  and had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
historically  the fair value of our ars holdings approximated par value due to the frequent auction periods  generally every to days  which provided liquidity to these investments 
however  since february  all auctions involving these securities have failed 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars holdings will continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for our ars holdings develop 
we cannot be certain regarding the amount of time it will take for an auction market or other markets to develop 
additionally  approximately one half of the auction rate securities we hold were  during  either downgraded below aaa or placed on watch status by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 

table of contents we estimate the fair value of our ars holdings using an income approach valuation technique 
using this approach  expected future cash flows are calculated over the expected life of each security and are discounted to a single present value using a market required rate of return 
some of the more significant assumptions made in the present value calculations include i the estimated weighted average lives for the loan portfolios underlying each individual ars and ii the required rates of return used to discount the estimated future cash flows over the estimated life of each security  which consider both the credit quality for each individual ars and the market liquidity for these investments 
additionally  effective april   we adopted new authoritative guidance which required us to separate losses associated with our ars into two categories  the portion of the loss which is considered credit loss and the portion of the loss which is due to other factors 
as discussed above  certain of the auction rate securities we hold were  during  downgraded below aaa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
these revised credit ratings were a significant consideration in determining the estimated credit loss associated with our ars 
our ars have been classified as level assets as their valuation  including the portion of their valuation attributable to credit losses  requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
if different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation approach including  but not limited to  assumptions involving the estimated lives of the ars holdings the estimated cash flows over those estimated lives  and the estimated discount rates applied to those cash flows  the estimated fair value of these investments could be significantly higher or lower than the fair value we determined 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities as well as the individual ars holdings we own 
we may be required to record losses in future periods  either realized or unrealized  if the fair value of our ars deteriorates further 
see note located within the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding our ars 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted authoritative guidance which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense over the service period generally the vesting period in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in this model are expected dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term 
unvested stock options and restricted stock awards that were granted prior to january  continued to be accounted for using the same grant date fair value and same expense attribution method used under previously issued authoritative guidance  except that all awards are recognized in the results of operations over the remaining vesting periods 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock options and restricted stock awards held by employees  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years  related to the company s stock based compensation plans 
deferred taxes 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
these net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets  including the portion related to excess tax benefits of stock based awards  are reserved for by a valuation allowance as required by relevant accounting literature 
the remaining portion of our net deferred tax assets are no longer reserved for by a valuation allowance 
management determines the need for a valuation allowance by assessing the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income 
management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future 
tax contingencies 
our tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by tax authorities 
these potential exposures result from applications of various statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimates of tax contingencies reflect assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
we 
table of contents believe that these assumptions and judgments are reasonable 
however  our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
consistent with our historical financial reporting  we have elected to reflect interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision

explanatory note regarding adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed as supplemental to  and not as an alternative for  income loss from continuing operations or net income loss calculated in accordance with gaap 
our management uses adjusted ebitda as an additional measure of performance for purposes of business decision making  including developing budgets  managing expenditures  and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures 
period to period comparisons of adjusted ebitda help our management identify additional trends in financial results that may not be shown solely by period to period comparisons of income loss from continuing operations or net income loss 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda in the incentive compensation programs applicable to many of our employees in order to evaluate our performance 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by our management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions 
in addition  we believe that providing adjusted ebitda  together with a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to income loss from continuing operations or to net income loss  helps investors make comparisons between us and other companies that may have different capital structures  different effective income tax rates and tax attributes  different capitalized asset values and or different forms of employee compensation

outlook on future liquidity as of december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and held investments with an aggregate fair value of  based on our plans and expectations  and taking into consideration issues relating to the liquidity of our ars investments  as well as the redemption provision that becomes available to the holders of our million of convertible notes in june  we believe that our available cash resources and future cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash resources to meet the cash commitments of our notes  our notes and to fund our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  for at least the next twenty four months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels  implementation of new or updated application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments  potential future acquisitions and whether holders of our notes and our notes elect their rights to convert their holdings to equity or elect their rights for redemption 
in addition  our ability to generate cash flow is subject to numerous factors beyond our control  including general economic  regulatory and other matters affecting us and our customers 
we plan to continue to enhance our online services and to continue to invest in acquisitions  strategic relationships  facilities and technological 
table of contents infrastructure and product development 
we intend to grow each of our existing businesses and enter into complementary ones through both internal investments and acquisitions 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements adopted during we adopted the new authoritative guidance which establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests  previously called minority interests 
this new guidance requires that a noncontrolling interest be reported in the consolidated balance sheets within equity and separate from the parent company s equity 
also  the new guidance requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent s and noncontrolling interest s shares and  separately  the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest  all on the face of the consolidated operating statement 
in addition  discontinued operations and continuing operations reflected as part of the noncontrolling interest should be allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations for the calculation of earnings per share 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the retrospective application of this accounting standard which we adopted effective january  we adopted the new authoritative guidance which requires cash settled convertible debt to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each 
this new guidance affects the accounting for our notes 
the value assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar bond without the conversion feature 
the difference between the bond s cash proceeds and this estimated fair value  which was  at the time the notes were issued during august  represents a debt discount and will be amortized to interest expense over the period from issuance to august the first date on which we may be required to repurchase the notes at the option of the holder 
the  also represents the value of the equity component on the notes and was included within additional paid in capital through december  the consolidated financial statements reflect the retrospective application of this accounting standard which we adopted effective january  effective january   we adopted the revised authoritative guidance on business combinations which changed existing practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements are now fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs are now expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  reversal of valuation allowances created in purchase accounting are now recorded through the income tax provision  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  all authoritative guidance would have to be met at the acquisition date 
while the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements  it could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated in the future and for tax matters relating to prior acquisitions settled subsequent to december  effective january   we adopted the authoritative guidance which clarifies that unvested share based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities 
we reflected the impact on the year ended december  in the net income loss per common share section of note contained elsewhere in this annual report 
the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact 
table of contents on the years ended december  and and accordingly  those periods were not retrospectively adjusted 
in april  the financial accounting standards board which we refer to as the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim reporting periods 
such disclosures were previously required only in annual financial statements 
because this pronouncement applies only to financial statement disclosure  it did not have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which changed when and how to assess other than temporary impairments of securities and to improve the financial statement presentation of such impairments 
a more detailed description of this new guidance and the impact of its adoption is discussed in note contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
this new guidance was effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which established the fasb accounting standards codification which we refer to as codification 
on the effective date of this new guidance  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
this new guidance was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  because this pronouncement applies only to financial statement disclosure  it did not have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables 
in addition  revenue under multiple element arrangements will be allocated using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in january  the fasb issued an amendment regarding improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this new guidance requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 

table of contents changes in prevailing interest rates will cause the fair value of certain of our investments to fluctuate  such as our investments in auction rate securities that generally bear interest at rates indexed to libor 
as of december   the fair market value of our auction rate securities was million 
however  the fair values of our cash and money market investments  which approximate million at december   are not subject to changes in interest rates 
we have entered into non recourse credit facilities which we refer to as the credit facilities with citigroup that is secured by our ars holdings including  in some circumstances  interest payable on the ars holdings  that will allow us to borrow up to of the face amount of the ars holdings pledged as collateral under the credit facilities 
the interest rate applicable to such borrowings is the open federal funds rate plus basis points 
no borrowings have been made under the credit facilities to date 
the notes and the notes that we have issued have fixed interest rates  changes in interest rates will not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and expenses are denominated in united states dollars  however  porex  which was sold on october  and included in discontinued operations  was exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the rate of exchange of the united states dollar against the euro 
this exposure arises primarily as a result of translating the results of porex s foreign operations to the united states dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the accounting period 
porex did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
foreign currency translation gains losses relating to our porex operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively
