item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
industry trends the it strategy for many businesses has been increasingly focused on data center it outsourcing in an effort to reduce costs  improve responsiveness to a changing business environment  and focus internal resources on projects that deliver competitive advantages 
while it capabilities were often viewed as competitive advantages 
table of contents in the past  many businesses now recognize that a large part of their it infrastructure is important  yet it no longer provides a strategic or financial advantage 
as the core functions of it  such as data storage  processing  and transport  have become commonplace throughout all industries  these functions have become routine and increasingly thought of as simply costs of doing business 
many businesses are also recognizing the high cost and inefficiency of managing it infrastructure themselves  including the difficulties of upgrading technology  training and retaining skilled personnel with domain expertise  and matching it costs with actual benefits 
given these trends in it strategy  budget constraints  and inefficient use of resources  businesses often look to outsource significant parts of their it functions to trusted partners so they can focus on the areas that still provide competitive advantages  such as customer or industry specific applications 
most businesses today will consider outsourcing when reviewing their it strategies  however  traditional outsourcing approaches  such as colocation  do not often provide meaningful strategic  operational  or financial benefits as many outsourcers simply operate a customer s infrastructure without fundamentally changing or updating the underlying technology or the way the infrastructure is managed or  in cases where holistic outsourcing agreements are in place  businesses lose control of differentiating it applications 
for example  an outsourcer may run the customer s current it systems more efficiently  but because they use legacy technology  the customer will likely not achieve the benefits of an operating infrastructure utilizing the latest technology hardware  software  and it research and development 
our solution is to provide a range of infrastructure services that enable customers to improve the quality and lower the cost of their it operations and increase the availability and flexibility of their it systems 
in addition  our solution may allow our customers to have visibility and control of their application performance while shifting our customers from a corporate model based on large capital investments for buying  maintaining  and depreciating it assets to a pay as you go service model that allows customers to scale their it infrastructure up or down as their business requirements change 
our approach enables us to be a flexible and scalable partner to our customers that can provide tailored  end to end it infrastructure solutions on demand 
our strategy we focus exclusively on providing it services primarily to business enterprises 
because of our global infrastructure  management systems  and business model  we have the unique capability to deliver fully managed and integrated it solutions to enterprises with offices around the world 
our key growth strategies include the following target the right customers 
we specifically target customers that we believe will receive the most economic value from using our services 
many mid sized businesses have traditionally outsourced single it service offerings  such as network services or hosting services  and have continued to own and manage portions of their it infrastructure themselves 
we believe that these businesses can lower the overall cost of their it operations while improving the quality of their it systems by purchasing our managed services and outsourcing the majority of their it services rather than a single it service 
we believe that pursuing these customers will allow us to increase revenues and profitability as these customers purchase our higher margin services while at the same time reducing their overall it costs 
offer targeted business solutions to solve specific customers needs 
we develop  market  and deliver solutions designed to satisfy the needs of specific customer segments 
these end to end solutions are comprised primarily of our technical capabilities  our consulting services  and often third party services 
examples of our solutions include proximity hosting for the financial industry  software as a service enablement services for the independent software vendor and software provider industry  and test and development solutions for companies looking to outsource their software testing and development infrastructure 
our customer focused solutions allow us to offer more compelling value propositions to targeted customer segments 

table of contents deliver compelling and comprehensive technical capabilities 
our broad  integrated  comprehensive offering of it services allows us to act as a full service provider to our customers 
unlike most of our competitors who have limited or single service offerings  we offer a full range of solutions  including hosting  cloud  computing  storage  applications  network  and security services 
our full service orientation creates incremental revenue growth as customers seek to minimize the number of outside vendors and demand one stop service providers 
additionally  we can meet customers increasing it demands through scalable solutions 
leverage our data centers and global network and take advantage of expansion opportunities 
we currently operate data centers around the world  which we expect will provide us with significant operating leverage as we increase the amount of our revenue that is derived from managed services 
by supplementing existing customers that purchase only colocation or network services with customers that purchase a wide array of higher value managed services  we expect to be able to increase the revenues we derive from these data centers 
through our global data center expansion in and  we opened ten new or expanded high grade data centers in high growth  high demand markets 
in total  these new and expanded data centers added approximately  square feet of gross raised floor space  and enable us to sell additional colocation and managed hosting services 
in  we began the expansion of our hosting facility located in weehawken  new jersey  which will add approximately  square feet of gross raised floor space over the next five years  and more recently announced an expansion in our chicago  illinois data center 
our infrastructure we provide our services through our global infrastructure that includes data centers in the united states  europe  and asia with approximately million square feet of gross raised floor space  tier multi g mpls ip backbone with over  miles of fiber  and operations support system  or oss  which provides automated provisioning  end to end management  and integration with commercial element management systems 
we have combined our global infrastructure with virtualization and automation technologies to allow us to offer our services as part of a total outsourcing solution or on a utility services basis 
by applying virtualization technology to our servers  storage  security  and network devices  we are able to offer customers connected to our network access to a suite of services  without the customer having to purchase  install  and configure equipment and network services  and with the ability to easily scale the infrastructure to meet evolving customer requirements 
for information regarding our revenue and long lived assets by geographic region  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
customers we currently provide services to customers across all industries including the financial services  media and entertainment  software  and government sectors 
no single customer accounted for more than of our revenue during and customers in the government sector did not account for a material percentage of our total revenue during our contracts with our customers are typically for one to three years in length 
many of our customer contracts contain service level agreements that provide for service credits if we fail to maintain defined and specific quality levels of service 

table of contents sales and marketing we reach potential new customers and sell new services to our existing customers through our direct sales force  indirect sales channels and marketing programs 
direct sales 
we have approximately sales representatives that work directly with potential new and existing customers 
our direct sales force uses a solution selling approach to understand a customer s it infrastructure requirements 
once an opportunity is identified with a new or existing customer  we engage product and engineering support resources to design the final solution 
all direct sales representatives take part in an extensive training program designed to develop in depth consultative selling skills 
indirect sales 
we market our products and solutions through various indirect channels  including collaborations with existing customers and systems integrators 
by working with these companies  we have opened new avenues for growth and see potential for significant opportunities to further enhance revenue growth through these types of relationships 
marketing 
we are a business to business company whose marketing programs are targeted at information technology executives  as well as line of business and finance executives 
we use marketing campaigns to increase brand awareness  generate leads  accelerate the sales process  retain existing customers  and promote new products to existing and prospective customers 
we participate in industry conferences and trade shows 
we use direct mail  e newsletters  surveys  internet marketing  on line and on site seminars  collateral materials  and welcome kits to communicate with existing customers and to reach potential new customers 
our employees author and publish articles about industry trends and our services 
additionally  we work closely with industry analysts and the press so that they understand and can communicate the value of our services 
competition prospective customers for our infrastructure solutions often weigh the advantages of outsourcing to a service provider against their ability to manage it infrastructure internally 
in those instances  the in house solution is a source of competition 
our external competitors range from very large telecommunications companies  hardware manufacturers  and system integrators that support the in house it operations for a business or offer outsourcing solutions  to smaller point solutions companies that sell individual it services or solutions to selected industries  as follows telecommunications companies 
this category includes companies such as at t inc  verizon communications  inc  bt  and level communications 
these carriers have used their legacy voice and data business to expand into ip vpn and hosting services 
large scale systems integrators 
leading companies in this category include ibm  hp eds  accenture  and csc 
these companies tend to focus on large scale  long term systems integration projects and outsourcing contracts that include hiring a large portion of the client s staff 
infrastructure service providers 
companies such as equinix  inc  rackspace holdings  inc  terremark worldwide  inc  and internap network services corporation are included in this category 
these companies tend to focus on one part of internet infrastructure service such as colocation  managed hosting  cloud or internet access 
software vendors 
including companies such as microsoft corporation  oracle and salesforce 
com  these competitors focus on delivering their software offering as a hosted service and in some cases offer other hosted solutions into the market 
cloud providers 
these competitors focus on delivering cloud computing and  in some cases  software as a service to enterprise customers 
this category includes companies such as gogrid and amazon 
com  inc 
table of contents regulatory matters the following section describes material laws and regulatory developments that we believe are currently applicable to our business 
it does not cover all present or pending federal  state  local or foreign regulations affecting the communications industry 
us regulatory matters most of our existing services are not currently regulated by the federal communications commission  or fcc  or any other government agency of the united states or public utility commissions of the individual states  other than regulations that apply to businesses generally  although our private line service is generally regulated by the fcc as a telecommunications service 
as implemented by rules  policies  and precedents issued by the fcc  the telecommunications act of regulates the provision of telecommunications services and generally exempts information services and non common carrier services from its regulation 
we believe that many of the products and services we offer  whether on a facilities or resale basis  generally qualify as information services or non common carrier services and are therefore not subject to federal regulation 
however  in light of ongoing fcc proceedings and developing fcc case law  it is possible that some or all of the information services that we provide should or will become subject to certain regulatory requirements 
as a service provider to insured financial institutions  we are subject to the provisions of the bank service company act  which subjects the service provider to regulation  administrative jurisdiction and examination by the federal banking regulators with respect to the performance of services to insured depository institutions 
these provisions have not had a material effect on our operations or expenses 
financial services reform proposals pending in congress may potentially subject us to expanded regulation with respect to a broader class of customers and with respect to range and severity of regulatory actions to which we are exposed 
international regulatory matters our principal markets outside the united states include countries in europe and the asia pacific rim 
we have data centers in the united kingdom  japan  and singapore 
as is true in the united states  the market for our services in each of the major economies within these regions is open to foreign competition 
we believe that we are authorized to provide our services under the applicable regulations in all countries where we derive substantial business 
in certain countries throughout asia  latin america  the middle east  and africa  regulatory and market access barriers  including foreign ownership limitations and entrenched monopolies  continue to prevent us from providing services directly to customers 
as our business plan does not contemplate our selling a significant amount of services in any of these countries in the near term  we do not believe that our inability to offer services directly to customers in these countries will impact us significantly 
nevertheless  in many of the highly regulated countries in these regions  we partner with local providers to provide certain services to our customers 
intellectual property we have a number of united states and international patents protecting aspects of our technology  and we are currently pursuing additional patent applications in the united states and internationally 
we have registered trademarks for our business name and several product and service names and marketing slogans 
in addition  we have applied for trademark protection for various products  services and marketing slogans 
we have also registered various internet domain names in connection with the savvis public website 
although we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable  we do not believe that the expiration of any single patent  service mark or trademark would materially affect our consolidated results of operations

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to all other information provided to you in this document 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 
risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which makes our future results difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fall below expectations 
although we recognized net income of million for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   and a net loss of million for the year ended december  and we may incur net losses in the future 
we may also have fluctuations in revenues  expenses and losses due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following demand for and market acceptance of our hosting and network products  our ability to retain key employees that maintain relationships with our customers  the duration of the sales cycle for our services  changes in customers budgets for information technology purchases and in the timing of their purchasing decisions  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced services by our competitors  acquisitions and dispositions we may make  our ability to implement internal systems for reporting  order processing  purchasing  billing and general accounting  among other functions  our ability to meet performance standards under our agreements with our customers  changes in the prices we pay for utilities  local access connections  internet connectivity  and longhaul backbone connections  the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures  including costs relating to the expansion of operations  and of the replacement or upgrade of our network and hosting infrastructure  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
accordingly  our results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 

table of contents demand for our services is vulnerable to economic downturns 
if general economic conditions continue to weaken  then our revenues and our financial condition may materially decline 
we are vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
due to the ongoing economic downturn  demand for our services may decrease as our customers face a deterioration of their businesses or decide to delay capital spending out of uncertainty regarding the future 
in addition  our customers may find it more difficult to raise capital in the future due to substantial limitations on the availability of credit and may be forced to delay upgrades to their it infrastructure 
furthermore  our customers may demand better pricing terms and their ability to timely pay our invoices may be affected by an increasingly weakened economy 
a continued deterioration of the economy could also result in a number of our customers facing bankruptcy 
as a result  customers may reduce the services they purchase from us  merge with competitors or enter into bankruptcy  any of which could adversely affect our revenues 
if the economy weakens further  then our revenues and overall financial condition may be adversely affected 
we operate in a rapidly evolving industry  which makes our future operating results difficult to predict 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid technological innovation  changing client needs  evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services 
our success depends on our ability to implement managed  network and cloud services that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry developments  and client needs 
as we encounter new client requirements and increasing competitive pressures  we will likely be required to modify  enhance  reposition or introduce new solutions and service offerings 
we may not be successful in doing so in a timely  cost effective and appropriately responsive manner  or at all 
all of these factors make it difficult to predict our future operating results  which may impair our ability to manage our business and our investors ability to assess our prospects 
our failure to meet performance standards under our customer contracts could result in our customers terminating their relationships with us or our customers being entitled to receive financial compensation  which could lead to reduced revenues 
our agreements with our customers contain various guarantees regarding our performance and our levels of service 
if we fail to provide the levels of service or performance required by our agreements  our customers may be able to receive service credits for their accounts and other financial compensation  as well as terminate their relationship with us 
in addition  any inability to meet our service level commitments or other performance standards could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers  which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results 
we depend on a number of third party providers  and the loss of  or problems with  one or more of these providers may cause financial losses  impede our growth or cause us to lose customers 
we are dependent on third party providers to supply products and services 
for example  we lease or otherwise procure equipment from equipment providers  bandwidth capacity from telecommunications network providers in the quantities and quality we require  data center space from third party landlords  power services from local utilities and other energy suppliers  and we source equipment maintenance through third parties 
while we have entered into various agreements for equipment  carrier line capacity  data center space  power services  and maintenance  any failure to obtain equipment  additional capacity or space  power services  or maintenance  if required  would impede the growth of our business  harm our reputation and cause our financial results to suffer 
the equipment that we purchase could be deficient in some way  thereby affecting our products and services 
our customers that use the equipment and facilities we lease or the services of these telecommunication providers may in the future experience difficulties due to failures unrelated to our systems 
additionally  any one of these third party providers could suffer financial failure and  as a result  become incapable of supplying products and services to us 
if  for any reason  these providers fail to provide the required services to us or our customers or suffer other failures  we may incur financial losses and our customers may lose confidence in our company  and we may not be able to retain these customers 

table of contents our indebtedness  ability to repay or refinance  could limit our ability to operate our business successfully 
as of december   the total principal amount of our debt  including capital and financing method lease obligations was million  of which million represented the book value of our million convertible notes due in may in addition  we expect from time to time to continue to incur additional indebtedness and other liabilities in the future 
if we incur additional indebtedness or if we use more cash than we generate in the future  then the possibility that we may not have cash sufficient to pay  when due  the outstanding amount of our indebtedness will increase 
if we do not have sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they mature  we will have to refinance such obligations or we could be in default under the terms of our debt obligations  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such refinancing or that the terms of any refinancing will be acceptable to us 
this also means that we will need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness  reducing the funds available for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  sales and marketing initiatives  acquisitions  and general corporate or other purposes 
our debt agreements also contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur more debt  pay dividends and make distributions  make certain investments  repurchase stock  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  make capital expenditures  merge or consolidate  and transfer or sell assets without obtaining the approval of the lender 
in addition  some of our debt agreements contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum performance levels 
our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could trigger cross defaults and acceleration of repayment obligations 
we may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms to meet our future capital needs 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow from our operations  we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings in the future in order to meet our operating and capital needs 
we may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms  or at all  at the time when we need such funding 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we may not be able to pursue our growth strategy and our business could suffer 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
in addition  any debt financing that we may secure in the future could have restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
furthermore  if we decide to raise funds through debt or convertible debt financings  we may be unable to meet our interest or principal payments 
we may make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances  each of which is accompanied by inherent risks 
if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances with other companies 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired services  products  or technologies with our current services  products  and technologies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the diversion of management attention from our existing business  the inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  
table of contents the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures  and policies  the impairment of relationships with employees  suppliers  and customers as a result of any integration  the loss of an acquired or existing base of customers and accompanying revenue  the assumption of leased facilities or other long term commitments  or the assumptions of unknown liabilities  that could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and cash flow  and dilution to our stockholders 
as a result of these potential problems and risks  businesses that we may acquire or invest in may not produce the revenue  earnings  or business synergies that we anticipated 
these potential problems and risks may have an adverse impact on both our ability to provide services to our customers and our relationships with our customers 
in addition  we cannot be assured that any potential transaction will be successfully identified and completed or that  if completed  the acquired businesses or investment will generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other potential harmful effects on our business 
a material reduction in revenue from our largest customer or the loss of other key customers could harm our financial results to the extent not offset by cost reductions or additional revenue from new or other existing customers 
thomson reuters accounted for approximately of our revenue in   and investment companies  banks and other financial services companies  excluding thomson reuters  accounted for approximately of our revenue in and of our revenue in and the loss of thomson reuters or any of our other key customers  including our customers in the financial sector  due to the acquisition of such customers  their financial failure or bankruptcy  adverse economic or other reasons  or a considerable reduction in the amount of our services that these customers purchase  could materially reduce our revenues which  to the extent not offset by cost reductions or revenue from new or other existing customers  could materially reduce our cash flows and adversely affect our financial position 
this may limit our ability to raise capital or fund our operations  working capital needs  and capital expenditures in the future 
our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain peering arrangements with internet service providers on favorable terms 
we enter into peering agreements with internet service providers throughout our market which allow us to access the internet and exchange traffic transparently with these providers 
previously  many providers agreed to exchange traffic without charging each other 
however  some providers that previously offered peering transparency have reduced peering relationships or are seeking to impose charges for transit  especially for unbalanced traffic offered and received by us with these peering partners 
for example  several network operators with large numbers of individual users claim that they should be able to charge network operators and businesses that send traffic to those users 
increases in costs associated with internet and exchange traffic could have an adverse effect on our business 
if we are not able to maintain our peering relationships on favorable terms  we may not be able to provide our customers with affordable services  which would adversely affect our results from operations 

table of contents failures in our products or services  including our network  hosting and colocation services  could disrupt our ability to provide services  increase our capital costs  result in a loss of customers  or otherwise negatively affect our business 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends upon our ability to provide high quality  reliable services 
interruptions in our ability to provide our services to our customers or failures in our products or services  through the occurrence of a natural disaster  human error  component or system failure  extreme temperature  or other unanticipated problem  could adversely affect our customers businesses and our business and reputation 
for example  problems at one or more of our data center facilities could result in service interruptions or failures or could cause significant equipment damage 
in addition  our network could be subject to unauthorized access  computer viruses  and other disruptive problems caused by customers  employees  or others 
unauthorized access  computer viruses  or other disruptive problems could lead to interruptions  delays  or cessation of service to our customers 
in addition  we may be unable to implement disaster recovery or security measures in a timely manner or  if and when implemented  these measures may not be sufficient or could be circumvented through the reoccurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem  or as a result of accidental or intentional actions 
resolving network failures or alleviating security problems may also require interruptions  delays  or cessation of service to our customers 
accordingly  failures in our products and services  including problems at our data centers  network interruptions  or breaches of security on our network may result in significant liability  penalties  a loss of customers  and damage to our reputation 
our operations may be harmed and we could be subject to regulatory penalties and litigation if our network security is breached by unauthorized third parties 
if unauthorized third parties breach the security measures on our network  we could be subject to liability and could face reduced customer confidence in our services 
unauthorized access could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information of our customers or our customers end users  which might expose us to liability from customers and the government agencies that regulate us  including under an increasing number of information security and privacy laws  as well as deter potential customers from purchasing our services 
any internal or external breach in our network could severely harm our business and result in costly litigation and potential liability for us 
although we attempt to limit these risks contractually  there can be no assurance that we will limit the risk or avoid incurring financial penalties 
to the extent our customers demand that we accept unlimited liability and to the extent there is a competitive trend to accept it  such a trend could affect our ability to retain these limitations in our contracts at the risk of losing the business 
increased energy costs  power outages  and limited availability of electrical resources may adversely affect our operating results 
our data centers are susceptible to regional costs and supply of power and electrical power outages 
we attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies 
however  we may not be able to limit our exposure entirely even with these protections in place 
in addition  our energy costs can fluctuate significantly or increase for a variety of reasons including increased pressure on legislators to pass green legislation 
as energy costs increase  we may not always be able to pass on the increased costs of energy to our customers  which could harm our business 
power and cooling requirements at our data centers are also increasing as a result of the increasing power demands of today s servers 
since we rely on third parties to provide our data centers with power sufficient to meet our customers power needs  our data centers could have a limited or inadequate amount of electrical resources 
our customers demand for power may also exceed the power capacity in our older data centers  which may limit our ability to fully utilize these data centers 
this could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and hinder our ability to run our data centers  which could harm our business 

table of contents concerns about the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and the global climate change may result in environmental taxes  charges  regulatory schemes  assessments or penalties  which could restrict or negatively impact our operations or reduce our profitability 
the impacts of human activity on global climate change have attracted considerable public and scientific attention  as well as the attention of the united states and other governments 
efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse emissions and energy consumption  including those from coal combustion by power plants 
we rely on power from these power plants  and the added cost of any environmental regulation  taxes  charges  assessments or penalties levied or imposed on these power plants could be passed on to us  increasing the cost to run our data centers and reducing our profitability 
there are a number of state and federal legislative and environmental regulatory initiatives  as well as those internationally  that could restrict or negatively impact our operations or increase our energy costs 
additionally  environmental regulation  taxes  charges  assessments or penalties could be levied or imposed directly on us 
any enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the united states  or any domestic or foreign jurisdiction we perform business in  could adversely effect our operations and financial results 
if we are unable to recruit or retain qualified personnel  our business could be harmed 
we must continue to identify  hire  train  and retain it professionals  technical engineers  operations employees  and sales and senior management personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who can provide the technical  strategic  and marketing skills required for our company to grow 
there is a shortage of qualified personnel in these fields  and we compete with other companies for the limited pool of these personnel  including without limitation  candidates for our open chief executive officer position 
the failure to recruit and retain necessary technical  managerial  sales  and marketing personnel  including but not limited to members of our executive team  could harm our business and our ability to grow our company 
our failure to implement our growth strategy successfully could harm our business 
our growth strategy includes increasing revenue from our managed hosting  colocation and network services 
we seek to sell managed hosting  colocation  and network services to our customers  thereby strengthening the customer relationship 
while initially customers may only purchase one or two services  we believe that once the customer sees the benefit of our infrastructure offerings to their business they will purchase additional services 
we have developed new data center capabilities as part of our growth strategy 
if we do not have sufficient customer demand in the markets to support the new data centers we have built  our financial results may be harmed 
there is no assurance that we will be able to implement these initiatives in a timely or cost effective manner  and this failure to implement our growth strategy could cause our operations and financial results to be negatively affected 
we have agreed to certain indemnification obligations which  if we are required to perform  may negatively affect our operations 
in connection with our sale of the assets related to our content delivery network  we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain losses that it may incur due to a breach of our representations and warranties 
if we are required to perform such obligations should they arise  any actions we are required to take or payments we are required to make could harm our operations and prevent us from being able to engage in favorable business activities  consummate strategic acquisitions or otherwise fund capital needs 
we may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our network 
the law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on  stored  or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled 
we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content disseminated on our network 
for example  lawsuits may be brought against us claiming that material on our 
table of contents network on which someone relied was inaccurate 
claims could also involve matters such as defamation  invasion of privacy  and copyright infringement 
if we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks  or are required to defend ourselves against such claims  our financial results could be negatively affected 
difficulties presented by international economic  political  legal  accounting  tax and business factors could harm our business in international markets 
for the year ended december   of our total revenue was generated in countries outside of the united states 
some risks inherent in conducting business internationally include regulatory  tax  licensing  political or other business restrictions or requirements  longer payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable  uncertain regulations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  our ability to secure and maintain the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure  challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations  and more restrictive laws or regulations  or more restrictive interpretations of existing laws or regulations  such as those related to content distributed over the internet 
any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business 
our inability to renew our data center leases  or renew on favorable terms  could have a negative impact on our financial results 
all of our data centers are leased and have lease terms that expire between and the majority of these leases provide us with the opportunity to renew the lease at our option for periods generally ranging from five to ten years 
many of these options however  if renewed  provide that rent for the renewal period will be equal to the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal 
if the fair market rental rates are significantly higher than our current rental rates  we may be unable to offset these costs by charging more for our services  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
additionally  the terms of a renewal may cause different accounting treatment for a lease  which could cause changes to our total debt position and have an adverse impact on our reported financial position or debt covenants 
also  it is possible that a landlord may insist on other financially unfavorable renewal terms or  where no further option to renew exists  elect not to renew all together 
our right to undisturbed use of our leased data centers may be challenged if our landlords lenders exercise their rights due to our landlords default on their debt 
we lease the land and buildings which support our data centers 
continued economic degradation may negatively impact and create greater pressure in the commercial real estate market causing higher incidences of landlord default or lender foreclosure of properties  including perhaps the properties which support our data centers 
while in most cases we maintain certain non disturbance rights  it is not certain that such rights will in all cases be upheld  thereby jeopardizing our continued right of occupancy in such instances 

table of contents we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of internal and external nondisclosure safeguards including confidentiality agreements  as well as trade secret and other intellectual property laws and vehicles to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot  however  assure that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we also are subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
any such claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the alleged infringement 
our investment portfolio is subject to market fluctuations which may affect our liquidity 
historically  we have invested in aaa rated us government agencies  aaa rated money market funds meeting certain criteria  and a p rated commercial paper 
the market value of these investments may decline due to general credit  liquidity  market  interest rate  and issuer default risks  which may be directly or indirectly affected by the ongoing credit crisis that has affected various sectors of the financial markets causing credit and liquidity issues 
if the ongoing global credit crisis persists or intensifies  declines in the market values of our investments in the future could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
risks related to our industry the markets for our hosting  network and professional services are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets for our hosting  network  and professional services are extremely competitive 
we expect that competition will intensify in the future  and we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise  sales  and marketing abilities or support capabilities to compete successfully in these markets 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and greater market presence  lower costs of capital  and greater engineering and marketing capabilities and financial  technological  and personnel resources than we do 
as a result  as compared to us  our competitors may develop and expand their networking infrastructures and service offerings more efficiently or more quickly  adapt more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more effectively  develop products and services that are superior to ours or have greater market acceptance  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the promotion  marketing  sale  research  and development of their products and services  make more attractive price and performance offers to our existing and potential employees  establish cooperative relationships with each other or with third parties  and take advantage of existing relationships with customers more effectively or exploit their more widely recognized brand name to market and sell their services 

table of contents if we are unable to compete effectively  this could result in an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
if the markets for outsourced information technology services decline  there may be insufficient demand for our services and  as a result  our business strategy and objectives may fail 
our solutions are designed to enable a customer to focus on its core business while we manage and ensure the quality of its information technology  or it  infrastructure 
businesses may believe the risk of outsourcing is greater than the risk of managing their it operations themselves 
if businesses do not continue to recognize the high cost and inefficiency of managing it themselves  including the difficulties of upgrading technology  training and retaining skilled personnel with domain expertise  and matching it cost with actual benefits  they may not continue to outsource their it infrastructure to companies within our industry 
additionally  outsourcing may be associated with larger companies  such as hp and ibm  and we may not be as successful as these companies 
as a result of these risks  our business may suffer and it could adversely affect our business strategy and objectives and our ability to generate revenues 
our failure to achieve desired price levels could affect our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for some of the services that we offer 
prices for internet services have decreased in recent years and may decline in the future 
in addition  by bundling their services and reducing the overall cost of their services  telecommunications companies that compete with us may be able to provide customers with reduced communications costs in connection with their hosting  data networking  or internet access services  thereby significantly increasing pricing pressure on us 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any such price reductions even with an increase in the number of our customers  higher revenues from enhanced services  cost reductions  or otherwise 
in addition  we believe that the data networking and vpn and internet access and hosting industries are likely to continue to encounter consolidation which could result in greater efficiencies in the future 
increased price competition or consolidation in these markets could result in erosion of our revenues and operating margins and could have a negative impact on our profitability 
furthermore  larger consolidated telecommunications providers have indicated that they want to start billing companies delivering services over the internet a premium charge for priority access to connected customers 
if these providers are able to charge companies such as us for this  our costs will increase  and this could affect our results of operations 
new technologies could displace our services or render them obsolete 
new technologies or industry standards  including those technologies protected by intellectual property rights  have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to our hosting  networking  and internet access services 
the adoption of such new technologies or industry standards could render our data center technology and services obsolete  unmarketable  cause impairment of our existing assets  or require us to incur significant capital expenditures to expand and upgrade our technology to meet new standards 
in addition  government regulation may adversely affect the demand for hosting services 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify new service opportunities successfully or  if identified  be able to develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that services or technologies developed by others will not render our current and future services non competitive or obsolete or that our current and future services will achieve or sustain market acceptance or be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues raised by technological changes or new industry standards 
if we fail to anticipate the emergence of  or obtain access to  a new technology or industry standard  we may incur increased costs if we seek to use those technologies and standards  or our competitors that use such technologies and standards may use them more cost effectively than we do 

table of contents the data networking and internet access industries are highly regulated in many of the countries in which we currently operate or plan to provide services  which could restrict our ability to conduct business in the united states and internationally 
we are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services 
local laws and regulations  and their interpretation and enforcement  differ significantly among those jurisdictions  and can change significantly over time 
future regulatory  judicial  and legislative changes or interpretations may have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver services within various jurisdictions 
for example  the european union enacted a data retention system that  once implemented by individual member states  will involve requirements to retain certain ip data that could have an impact on our operations in europe 
moreover  national regulatory frameworks that are consistent with the policies and requirements of the world trade organization have only recently been  or are still being  put in place in many countries 
accordingly  many countries are still in the early stages of providing for and adapting to a liberalized telecommunications market 
as a result  in these markets we may encounter more protracted and difficult procedures to obtain licenses 
within the united states  the government continues to evaluate the data networking and internet access industries 
the federal communications commission has a number of on going proceedings that could affect our ability to provide services 
such regulations and policies may complicate  or make more costly  our efforts to provide services in the future  including increasing the costs of certain services that we purchase from regulated providers 
our operations are dependent on licenses and authorizations from governmental authorities in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate  and with respect to a limited number of our services  in the united states 
these licenses and authorizations generally will contain clauses pursuant to which we may be fined or our license may be revoked on short notice 
consequently  we may not be able to obtain or retain the licenses necessary for our operations or be able to retain these licenses at costs which allow us to compete effectively 
a number of our customers are banks  brokerage firms  investment managers  operators of exchanges or trading systems and other participants in the financial services industry 
as a service provider to some of these entities  we currently are subject to regulation and examination by regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our customers 
legislative proposals pending in congress could subject us to expanded regulation if enacted 
more aggressive use of current regulatory powers or the implementation of new regulatory regimes could increase our operating costs  subject us to potential penalties or affect our ability to continue serving the financial services market 
in addition  securities trading operations of some securities firms  involving placing servers or leasing server space in the same location at or proximate to exchange facilities  have drawn increased public and regulatory scrutiny and are among the subjects of a broad review of equity market structure recently announced by the sec 
rulemaking that arises from that review or otherwise could affect the cost  attractiveness or permissibility of certain of our services in ways that we cannot currently predict but that may have an adverse affect on our business  revenues and operating costs 
risks related to our common stock sales of a significant amount of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price or impair our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
we have approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  the majority of which is held by a small number of investment firms  including welsh  carson  anderson stowe  or welsh carson 
as of february   investment partnerships sponsored by welsh carson own approximately of our outstanding common stock  and since december  welsh carson has distributed over million shares of our common stock to its limited partners 
these shares may and some have been sold in the public market immediately following such distributions 
also  as of february   welsh carson and individuals affiliated with welsh carson are entitled to certain registration rights with respect to million shares of our common stock held by them 
sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market  including 
table of contents sales following welsh carson distributions  or the perception that those sales will occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
those sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity and equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we consider appropriate 
our stock price is subject to significant volatility 
since february   until the present  the closing price per share of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  subject to significant volatility due to conditions in the technology industry or in the financial markets generally  sales of our securities by significant stockholders and the other risks and uncertainties described or incorporated by reference herein 
our certificate of incorporation and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our certificate of incorporation and delaware law contain provisions which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  including provisions that give the board of directors the power to issue shares of preferred stock 
we have also chosen to be subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which  subject to certain exceptions  prevents a stockholder of more than of a company s voting stock from entering into business combinations set forth under section with that company

we are subject to various legal proceedings and actions arising in the normal course of our business

our services are designed to offer a flexible and comprehensive it solution that meets the specific it infrastructure and business needs of our customers 
our suite of products can be purchased individually  in various combinations  or as part of a total or partial outsourcing arrangement 
our colocation solutions meet the specific needs of customers who require control of their physical assets  while our managed hosting solution offerings provide customers with access to our services and infrastructure without the upfront capital costs associated with equipment acquisition 
by partnering with us  our customers may drive down the costs of acquiring and managing it infrastructure and achieve increased operational efficiency through the use of virtualized technology  and focus their resources on their core business while we focus on the delivery and performance of their it infrastructure services 
significant trends for the year ended december  included hosting revenue growth of over the year ended december  and revenue from the financial vertical of million  a increase over the year ended december  our cloud revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of over the year ended december  additionally  software as a service revenue increased to million 
for further information on our business and services  please refer to part i  item i of this annual report on form k 
business trends and outlook while the economy is showing signs of stabilizing  predictability in timing of sales cycles for new business has continued to be challenged by lengthy decision making cycles caused  in part  by strained it budgets 
despite these challenges  we believe we have considerable opportunity and believe that companies will increasingly consider adopting outsourced it solutions as they attempt to reduce their infrastructure spending and meet the increasing demands from their user communities 
our services model enables our enterprise customers to choose from a number of different strategies designed to reduce their it costs 
our focus is to provide mission critical  non discretionary it infrastructure outsourcing and we believe that our target customer base considers us specialists in the areas of server management  storage  virtualization  security and network infrastructure 
with the completion in of a significant phase of our global data center expansion  and additional expansion in key markets expected in  we believe we have the right footprint and functionality in place to provide our customers with the products and services they need at the locations where they need it 
however  we continue to work with our existing customers to understand their business needs and related geographic and product extension opportunities  the pursuit of which  we believe  will foster stronger  mutually beneficial relationships 
table of contents with our customers 
additionally  we are evaluating and entering into strategic alliances  such as our agreement with thomson reuters  which provides managed hosting and network solutions to thomson reuters customers through our data centers 
the center point of our strategy is to grow our hosting business through our managed hosting service offerings 
we believe that we can show customers that we can decrease their costs by moving towards our managed hosting solutions for their it needs 
while colocation and network services play an important and foundational role  we remain intensely focused on growing our managed hosting business  specifically in our new offerings such as cloud services 
we successfully launched the first of our cloud service offerings during and began the beta program on our advanced virtual private data center cloud services in the fourth quarter of the colocation market has grown  pricing has stabilized and we remain committed to delivering growth in that business as well 
however  we have seen decreases from non core  below market margin customers  including certain of those in the internet content business  and certain of our network products  which we expect to continue to be under pressure throughout we have increased our focus on our network services  with the goal of stabilizing that segment of our business while continuing to provide an integrated managed hosting and managed network solution  particularly in hosted applications requiring higher network performance characteristics 
we believe the intersection of colocation  network and managed hosting allows us to produce a much higher return on invested capital than colocation or network alone  particularly by leveraging technologies for shared platform resources 
based on current economic conditions and demand for our services  we also will continue to remain focused on initiatives that we believe will continue to improve and grow our business  including increasing the quality of our infrastructure and the reliability of our services through additional investments in systems  improving efficiencies in our services and support and our general and administrative areas through process and productivity improvements  expanding data center space to support growth in our hosting products and services  investing in cloud platforms and services  increasing client satisfaction through our delivery of differentiated services as reflected in responses to our customer satisfaction surveys  and exploring options for acquisitions and divestitures that facilitate the achievement of our strategic business objectives

eligible employees tendered  and we accepted for cancellation  an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock  representing approximately of the eligible options 
on june   we granted approximately million new options and cancelled the tendered eligible options 

table of contents data center development and expansion during the years ended december  and  we spent million and million  respectively  for the development of ten new data centers that were opened as part of our global data center expansion plan

as a result  total capital and financing method lease obligations increased by million 
lombard loan agreement and interest rate swap in june  one of our subsidiaries  savvis uk limited  entered into a loan agreement  or the lombard loan agreement  with lombard north central plc  or lombard 
the lombard loan agreement has a five year term and provides for borrowings of up to million to be used in connection with the construction and development of a new data center in the united kingdom 
we have guaranteed the obligations of savvis uk under the lombard loan agreement and the obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of savvis uk s current data center assets and certain future assets which will be located in the new data center 
as of december   we maintain a letter of credit  issued in  of million and outstanding borrowings under the lombard loan agreement totaled million  or approximately million  and had a variable interest rate of 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with national westminster bank  plc  or natwest  to amend our existing interest rate swap agreement  or the swap agreement 
the swap agreement hedges the monthly interest payments incurred and paid under our loan agreement with lombard during the three year period beginning january  and ending december  under the terms of the swap agreement  we owe monthly interest to natwest at a fixed libor interest rate of and receive from natwest payments based on the same variable notional amount at the one month libor interest rate set at the beginning of each month

for our revolving credit facility  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios  consisting of minimum ebitda and maximum capital expenditures covenants and maximum leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
as of and during the year ended december   we were in compliance with all such ratios 
the provisions of our debt agreements also contain covenants including  but not limited to  restricting or limiting our ability to incur more debt  issue guarantees  pay dividends  and repurchase stock subject to financial measures and other conditions 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of and during the year ended 
table of contents december   and anticipate compliance with all covenants for at least the next twelve months 
however  the ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements and could trigger cross defaults and acceleration of repayment obligations 
commitments and contingencies our customer contracts generally span multiple periods  which result in us entering into arrangements with various suppliers of communications services that require us to maintain minimum spending levels  some of which increase over time  to secure favorable pricing terms 
our remaining aggregate minimum spending levels  allocated ratably over the terms of such contracts  are million  million  million  million  million  and million during the years ended december      and thereafter  respectively 
should we not meet the minimum spending levels in any given term  decreasing termination liabilities  representing a percentage of the remaining contractual amounts  may become immediately due and payable 
furthermore  certain of these termination liabilities are potentially subject to reduction should we experience the loss of a major customer or suffer a loss of revenue from a general economic downturn 
before considering the effects of any potential reductions for the business downturn provisions  if we had terminated all of these agreements as of december   the maximum liability would have been million 
to mitigate this exposure  at times  we align our minimum spending commitments with customer revenue commitments for related services 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and actions arising in the normal course of our business 
while the results of all such proceedings and actions cannot be predicted  management believes  based on facts known to management today  that the ultimate outcome of all such proceedings and actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operation  or cash flows

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  such as letters of credit  indemnifications  and operating leases under which certain facilities are leased 
the agreements associated with such guarantees and financial instruments mature at various dates through january  and may be renewed as circumstances warrant 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility  pledged as collateral to support certain facility leases and utility agreements 
also  in connection with the sale of our assets related to content delivery network services  we agreed to indemnify the purchaser should it incur certain losses due to a breach of our representations and warranties 
we have not incurred a liability relating to these indemnification provisions in the past  and we believe that the likelihood of any future payout relating to these provisions is remote 
therefore  we have not recorded a liability during any period related to these indemnification provisions 
our guarantees and financial instruments are valued based on the estimated amount of exposure and the likelihood of performance being required 
based on our past experience  no claims have been made against these guarantees and financial instruments nor do we expect exposure to material losses resulting therefrom 
as a result  we determined such guarantees and financial instruments did not have significant value and have not recorded any related amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
for a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from recurring revenue streams  consisting primarily of hosting services  which includes managed hosting and colocation  and network services 
we recognize revenue from those services as services are provided 
installation fees and related costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the customer contract 
termination fees are recognized when received 
revenue is recognized when the related service has been provided  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in addition  we have service level commitments pursuant to individual customer contracts with a majority of our customers 
to the extent that such service levels are not achieved  or are otherwise disputed due to performance or service issues  unfavorable weather  or other service interruptions or conditions  we estimate the amount of credits to be issued and record a reduction to revenue  with a corresponding increase in the allowance for credits and uncollectibles 
in the event that we provide credits or payments to customers related to service level claims  we may request recovery of such costs through third party insurance agreements 
insurance proceeds received under these agreements are recorded as an offset to previously recorded revenue reductions 
allowance for credits and uncollectibles as previously described herein  we have service level commitments with certain of our customers 
to the extent that such service levels are not achieved  we estimate the amount of credits to be issued  based on historical credits issued and known disputes  and record a reduction to revenue  with a corresponding increase in the allowance for credits and uncollectibles 

table of contents we assess collectibility of account receivables based on a number of factors  including customer payment history and creditworthiness 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers although in certain cases we may obtain a security deposit 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectibles when evaluating the adequacy of allowances  and we specifically analyze accounts receivable  current economic conditions and trends  historical bad debt write offs  customer concentrations  customer payment history and creditworthiness  and changes in customer payment terms 
delinquent account balances are charged to expense after we have determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
equity based compensation we calculate the fair value of total equity based compensation for stock options and restricted preferred units using the black scholes option pricing model  which utilizes certain assumptions and estimates that have a material impact on the amount of total compensation cost recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
total equity based compensation costs for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are calculated based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
an additional assumption is made on the number of awards expected to forfeit prior to vesting  which decreases the amount of total expense recognized 
this assumption is evaluated and the estimate is revised on a quarterly or as needed basis 
total equity based compensation is amortized to non cash equity based compensation expense over the vesting or performance period of the award  as applicable  which typically ranges from three to four years 
other critical accounting policies while all of the significant accounting policies described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are important  some of these policies may be viewed as being critical 
such policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and require our most difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions
