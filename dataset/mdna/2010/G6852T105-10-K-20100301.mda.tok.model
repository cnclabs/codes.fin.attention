item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit facilities 
access to funds under these existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding requirements 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding requirements if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time  and we might be forced to replace credit sources in a difficult market 
there have also been recent consolidations in the banking industry which could lead to increased reliance on and exposure to a limited number of institutions 
if we cannot obtain adequate financing or sources of credit on favorable terms  or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

table of contents changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
developments in accounting practices  for example a convergence of us gaap with international financial reporting standards ifrs  may require considerable additional expense to comply  particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted  but may affect the results of our operations  including among other things  the calculation of net income 
legal and enforcement activities relating to the insurance industry could affect our business and our industry 
the insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of litigation  investigations and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental and enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry 
these practices include the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products 
these investigations have resulted in changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets and industry business practices 
while at this time  none of these changes have caused an adverse effect on our business  we are unable to predict the potential effects  if any  that future investigations may have upon our industry 
emerging claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated developments in the law  as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance  reinsurance and other contracts 
these developments and changes may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
with respect to our casualty businesses  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some time after their occurrence 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by an increase in insurance and reinsurance contract disputes  arbitration and litigation 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages  and in particular  our casualty reinsurance contracts  may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
if our non us operations become subject to non us income taxation  our net income will decrease 
we believe that we and our non us subsidiaries have operated  and will continue to operate  our respective businesses in a manner that will not cause us to be viewed as engaged in a trade or business in the united states and  on this basis  we do not expect that either we or our non us subsidiaries will be required to pay non us corporate income taxes other than potential withholding taxes on certain types of us source passive income 
because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  the irs may contend that either we or our non us subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if either we or our non us subsidiaries are subject to us income tax  our shareholders equity and earnings will be reduced by the amount of such taxes  which might be material 
partnerre us corporation and its subsidiaries conduct business in the united states  and are subject to us corporate income taxes 
if proposed legislation previously introduced in both houses of congress is reintroduced and passed  our individual us shareholders may no longer qualify for current capital gains rates on our dividends 
currently  our individual us shareholders are taxed on dividends paid in taxable years beginning before january  at advantageous capital gains rates rather than ordinary income tax rates 
proposed legislation 
table of contents has been introduced in both houses of congress that would exclude shareholders of a foreign corporation from this advantageous treatment unless either i the corporation is organized or created in a country that has entered into a comprehensive income tax treaty with the us or ii the stock of such corporation is readily tradable on an established securities market in the us  and the corporation is organized or created in a country that has a comprehensive income tax system that the us secretary of the treasury determines is satisfactory for this purpose 
we would not satisfy either of these tests and  accordingly  if this legislation is reproposed and becomes law  individual us shareholders would no longer qualify for the advantageous capital gains rates on our dividends 
it is not possible to predict whether similar legislation might be reintroduced and enacted in the future 
the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has published reports and launched a global initiative among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
bermuda was not listed in the most recent report as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices  to embrace international tax standards for transparency  to exchange information and to eliminate an environment that attracts business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
if proposed us legislation is passed  our us reinsurance subsidiary may be subject to higher us taxation and our net income would decrease 
currently  our us reinsurance subsidiary retrocedes or may retrocede a portion of its us business to our us reinsurance subsidiaries and is generally entitled to deductions for premiums paid for such retrocessions 
proposed legislation has been introduced that if enacted would impose a limitation on such deductions  which could result in increased us tax on this business and decreased net income 
it is not possible to predict whether this or similar legislation may be enacted in the future 
we are a holding company  and if our subsidiaries do not make dividend and other payments to us  we may not be able to pay dividends or make payments on our debt securities and other obligations 
we are a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries and other intercompany balances 
we have cash outflows in the form of operating expenses  interest payments related to our long term debt  dividends to both common and preferred shareholders and  from time to time  cash outflows for principal repayments related to our long term debt  and the repurchase of common shares under our share repurchase program 
we rely primarily on cash dividends and payments from our subsidiaries to meet our cash outflows 
we expect future dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to be the principal source of funds to pay expenses and dividends 
the payment of dividends by our reinsurance subsidiaries is limited under bermuda  irish  swiss and french laws and certain statutes of various us states in which our us subsidiaries are licensed to transact business 
as of december   there were no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends by the company s subsidiaries that would limit the company s ability to pay common and preferred shareholders dividends and its corporate expenses 
because we are a holding company  our right  and hence the right of our creditors and shareholders  to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary of ours  upon our liquidation or reorganization or otherwise  is subject to the prior claims of policyholders and creditors of these subsidiaries 
investors may encounter difficulties in service of process and enforcement of judgments against us in the united states 
we are a bermuda company and some of our directors and officers are residents of various jurisdictions outside the united states 
all  or a substantial portion  of the assets of our officers and directors and of our assets 
table of contents are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
although we have appointed an agent and irrevocably agreed that the agent may be served with process in new york with respect to actions against us arising out of violations of the united states federal securities laws in any federal or state court in the united states  it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states 
it could also be difficult for investors to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of a united states court predicated upon civil liability provisions of united states federal securities laws 
there is no treaty in force between the united states and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a united states judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the united states court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
a judgment debt from a united states court that is final and for a sum certain based on united states federal securities laws will not be enforceable in bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the united states court  and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of bermuda law and not united states law 
in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  bermuda courts will not enforce a united states federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy 
an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity will not be entered by a bermuda court 
certain remedies available under the laws of united states jurisdictions  including certain remedies under united states federal securities laws  would not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they would be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim can be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of united states federal securities laws because these laws have no extra jurisdictional effect under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
operational risks  including human or systems failures  are inherent in our business 
operational risks and losses can result from many sources including fraud  errors by employees  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements or information technology failures 
we believe our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our business and reputation 
moreover  our technology and applications have been an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully 
such technology is and will continue to be a very important part of our underwriting process 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable service providers  or that our technology or applications will continue to operate as intended 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace these service providers or consultants without slowing our underwriting response time 
a major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in management distraction  harm to our reputation  a loss or delay of revenues or increased expense 
the continued integration of paris re into our business following the acquisition may present significant challenges and may result in the incurrence of significant costs 
we may face significant challenges  including regulatory  technical  accounting and other challenges  in combining paris re s operations into our operations in a timely and efficient manner and in retaining key personnel 
furthermore  management resources may be diverted for an extended period of time to accomplish this integration 
the failure to successfully integrate paris re and to successfully manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction 
in 
table of contents addition  we have been and will continue to incur integration and restructuring costs as we integrate the businesses of paris re with our businesses 
although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental integration and restructuring costs over time  we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term  if at all 
foreign currency fluctuations may reduce our net income and our capital levels 
through our multinational reinsurance operations  we conduct business in a variety of foreign non us currencies  the principal exposures being the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the swiss franc and the singapore dollar 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates 
our reporting currency is the us dollar  and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results and financial position 
we employ various strategies including hedging to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these exposures are not fully hedged or the hedges are ineffective  our results or equity may be reduced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
provisions in our bye laws may restrict the voting rights of our shares and may restrict the transferability of our shares 
our bye laws generally provide that if any person owns  directly  indirectly or by attribution  more than of our outstanding shares including our common and preferred shares  the voting rights attached to such shares will be reduced so that such person may not exercise and is not attributed more than of the total voting rights 
in addition  our board of directors may limit a shareholder s exercise of voting rights where it deems it necessary to do so to avoid non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders 
under our bye laws  subject to waiver by our board of directors  no transfer of our shares is permitted if such transfer would result in a shareholder controlling more than of our outstanding shares 
our bye laws also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders  then we have the option  but not the obligation  to require that shareholder to sell to us for fair market value the minimum number of shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences 
we also have the authority under our bye laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be limited pursuant to our bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us  we may  in our sole discretion  eliminate the shareholder s voting rights 
the loss of key executive officers could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend  partly upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers 
if any of these executives ceased to continue in his or her present role  we could be adversely affected 
we believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we compete 
our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and other key personnel 
the skills  experience and knowledge of the reinsurance industry of our management team constitute important competitive strengths 
if some or all of these managers leave their positions  and even if we were able to find persons with suitable skills to replace them  our operations could be adversely affected

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis reflects the consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries for the years ended december   and  including the results of paris re from october  to december  effective october   the company s ownership of the common shares of paris re increased to approximately  such that the company obtained a controlling interest in paris re at that date 
this interest was subsequently increased to in december executive overview the company is a leading global reinsurer  with a broadly diversified and balanced portfolio of traditional reinsurance risks and capital markets risks 
successful risk management is the foundation of the company s value proposition  with diversification of risks at the core of its risk management strategy 
the company s ability to succeed in the risk assumption and management business is dependent on its ability to accurately analyze and quantify risk  to understand volatility and how risks aggregate or correlate  and to establish the appropriate capital requirements and absolute limits for the risks assumed 
all risks are managed by the company within an integrated framework of policies and processes that ensure the intelligent and consistent evaluation and valuation of risk  and ultimately provide an appropriate return to shareholders 
the company s economic objective is to manage a portfolio of risks that will generate compound annual diluted book value per share growth of percent and an average operating return on beginning shareholders equity of percent over a reinsurance cycle 
in its reinsurance portfolio  the company writes all lines of business in virtually all markets worldwide  and differentiates itself through its risk management strategy and its financial strength 
in assuming its clients risks  the company removes the volatility associated with those risks from the clients financial statements  and then manages those risks and the risk related volatility 
through its broad product and geographic diversification  its excellent execution capabilities and its local presence in most major markets  the company is able to stabilize returns  respond quickly to market needs  and capitalize on business opportunities virtually anywhere in the world 
similarly  for the company s capital markets risks  which include both public and private market investments  diversification of risks is critical to achieving the risk and return objectives of the company 
the company s investment policy distinguishes between liquid  high quality assets that support the company s liabilities  and the more diversified  higher risk asset classes that make up the company s capital funds 
while there will be years where capital markets risks achieve less than the risk free rate of return  or potentially even negative results  the company believes the rewards for assuming these risks in a disciplined and measured way will produce a positive excess return to the company over time 
additionally  since capital markets risks are not fully correlated with the company s reinsurance risks  this increases the overall diversification of the company s total risk portfolio 
the reinsurance markets have historically been highly cyclical in nature 
the cycle is driven by competition  the amount of capital and capacity in the industry  loss events and investment returns 
the company s long term strategy to generate shareholder value focuses on broad product  asset and geographic diversification of risks  assuming a moderately greater degree of risk than the market average  actively managing its capital across its portfolio and over the duration of the cycle  adding value through underwriting and transactional excellence and achieving superior returns on invested assets in the context of a disciplined risk framework 
the company generates its reinsurance revenue from premiums 
premium rates and terms and conditions vary by line of business depending on market conditions 
pricing cycles are driven by supply of capital in the 
table of contents industry and demand for reinsurance and other risk transfer products 
the reinsurance business is also influenced by several other factors  including variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in legal  regulatory and judicial environments  loss trends  inflation and general economic conditions 
between and  premium rates increased  driven by large loss events and there were steep declines in interest rates and equity values  adding to the pressure for improvements in pricing and underwriting terms 
this began to reverse in late and continued into  when the company began to see a slowing and or flattening in the rate of improvement 
during  pricing was generally flat to down  except for wind exposed lines  with being the worst year in the history of the industry in terms of catastrophe losses  with hurricane katrina being the largest insured event ever 
consequently  the company observed in strong pricing increases in the lines and geographies that were affected by the large catastrophic loss events 
pricing in other lines was generally stable 
in  pricing remained strong for us wind exposed lines  while all other lines saw pricing declines 
in  pricing declined in most major markets and most lines of business as there was a continuation of the trend toward increasing risk retention by cedants  and restructuring proportional coverages to non proportional treaties  which led to the reduction in the amount of premiums in the reinsurance marketplace 
in  there was also severity of losses  such as hurricane ike  frequency of losses and severe and widespread financial turmoil stemming from the sub prime mortgage and resulting global credit and financial crisis 
the financial markets experienced severe dislocation and unprecedented events  including extreme volatility in foreign exchange markets and worldwide equity markets  significant declines in risk free interest rates and increases in credit spreads  risk assets under performing risk free assets and several financial institutions being subject to government bail out packages both in the us and europe 
in  the non life reinsurance market overall remained relatively unchanged from pricing and profitability improved in certain catastrophe exposed property lines in the us and japan  but elsewhere  especially in casualty lines  the impact of stagnant pricing and interest rates near historic lows caused continued pressure on returns on capital  pricing and profitability 
beginning in the second quarter  and continuing through the rest of  financial markets showed improvement  primarily with increases in worldwide equity and credit markets 
the acquisition of paris re  combined with a strong net income during  resulted in the company s total capital increasing to approximately billion at december  this provides the company with enhanced strategic and financial flexibility in a less predictable and more limited growth environment 
with the addition of paris re s diversified book of business  the company s clients will benefit from a broader product spread and increased size and balance 
specifically  the company s larger premium base allows it to deploy capital to the lines of business and markets with the most attractive risk and return characteristics  and take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
it is also expected that the increased capital base will enable the company to better position itself in order to continue to achieve its long term financial goals and generate long term shareholder value 
overall  the january  renewals saw stable market conditions with some measured deterioration  except for improvements observed in catastrophe and credit exposed lines in certain markets 
the us casualty lines remained uncertain at the january  renewals  with no indication of improving pricing or terms and conditions 
the global non life reinsurance market s priced profitability is declining under the weight of low risk free rates and overall pricing that is showing a modestly negative bias 
the company grew in markets with the most attractive risk and return opportunities  and generally maintained its position in lines where priced profitability was stable  but not yet improved 
the company and paris re renewed their january  books separately to facilitate an orderly renewal process for paris re s clients 
however  it is expected that the paris re business will renew under the company s name for the july  renewals 
management believes it has maintained appropriate diversification in its risk portfolio and maintained a similarly priced technical ratio defined below to that of the january  renewal 

table of contents a key challenge facing the company is to successfully manage through all phases of the reinsurance cycle 
the company is confident in its long term strategy  and believes that by closely monitoring the progression of each line of business  being selective in the business that it writes  and maintaining the diversification and balance of its portfolio  it will optimize returns 
individual lines of business and markets have their own unique characteristics and are at different stages of the reinsurance pricing cycle at any given point in time 
management believes it has achieved appropriate portfolio diversification by product  geography  line and type of business  length of tail  and distribution channel  and that this diversification  in addition to the financial strength of the company and its strong global franchise  will help to mitigate cyclical declines in underwriting profitability and to achieve a more stable return over time 
the company s profitability is significantly affected by the level of its losses and loss expenses incurred 
the company recognizes losses and loss expenses on the basis of actual and expected claims on business written and earned 
the company s non life and life net reserve positions at december  were billion and billion  respectively 
management believes that it follows prudent reserving policies to maintain a strong financial position 
a key challenge for the company is the accurate estimation of loss reserves for each line of business  which is critical in order to accurately determine the profitability of each line and allocate the appropriate amount of capital to each line in a manner that optimizes profitability 
within the company s life segment  the reinsurance market is differentiated between mortality and longevity products  with mortality being the larger market 
for the mortality markets in which the company writes business  the company observed improved pricing and conditions 
the company does not write life business in the us market 
the company s capital markets and investment operations  including public and private market investments  experienced a difficult year in  with significant economic fallout resulting from the deterioration of the credit markets which began in  and the collapse of the credit and equity markets in during  the improvements in equity and credit markets contributed to the company s return on its investment portfolio significantly outperforming risk free rates compared to its returns in  which were below risk free rates 
the company believes that capital market risks managed in a disciplined and measured way will generate positive excess returns to the company over time 
the company generates revenue from its substantial and high quality investment portfolio  as well as the investments underlying the funds held directly managed account 
the company follows prudent investment guidelines through a strategy that seeks to maximize returns while managing investment risk in line with the company s overall objectives of earnings stability and long term book value growth 
the company allocates its invested assets into two categories liability funds and capital funds 
see the discussion of liability funds and capital funds in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
a key challenge for the company is achieving the right balance between current investment income and total returns that include price appreciation or depreciation in changing market conditions 
the company regularly reviews the allocation of investments to asset classes within its investment portfolio and its funds held directly managed account and allocates investments to those asset classes the company anticipates will outperform in the near future  subject to limits and guidelines 
similarly  the company reduces its exposure to risk asset classes where returns are underperforming 
the company may also lengthen or shorten the duration of its fixed income portfolio in anticipation of changes in interest rates  or increase or decrease the amount of credit risk it assumes  depending on credit spreads and anticipated economic conditions 
during  the company took a measured approach to adding risk back into the investment portfolio  by increasing its allocation to equities  and it has shortened the duration of its fixed income portfolio given historically low interest rates 
key financial measures in addition to the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income  management uses three key measures to evaluate its financial performance  as well as the overall growth in value generated for the company s common shareholders 

table of contents diluted book value per share management uses growth in diluted book value per share as a prime measure of the value the company is generating for its common shareholders  as management believes that growth in the company s diluted book value per share ultimately translates into growth in the company s stock price 
diluted book value per share is calculated using common shareholders equity shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred shares divided by the number of fully diluted common shares outstanding assuming exercise of all stock based awards and other dilutive securities 
diluted book value per share is impacted by the company s net income and external factors such as foreign exchange  interest rates and equity markets  which can drive changes in unrealized gains or losses on its investment portfolio 
over the past seven years  since december   the company has generated a compound annual growth rate in diluted book value per share in excess of 
roe management uses operating return on beginning shareholders equity roe as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to common shareholders 
it is calculated using operating earnings or loss available to common shareholders net income or loss excluding after tax net realized gains or losses on investments  after tax net realized gain on purchase of capital efficient notes cents  after tax net interest in earnings or losses of equity investments and preferred share dividends divided by beginning common shareholders equity 
for the year ended december   following the acquisition of paris re  management adjusted the return on beginning common shareholders equity to be the sum of the results for the nine months ended september  divided by beginning of year common shareholders equity plus the results for the three months ended december  divided by beginning of year common shareholders equity plus the equity issued related to the acquisition of paris re 
management has set an average roe target over the reinsurance cycle  which management believes provides an attractive return to shareholders for the risk assumed 
each business unit and support department throughout the company is focused on seeking to ensure that the company meets the return objective 
this means that most economic decisions  including capital allocation and underwriting pricing decisions  incorporate an roe impact analysis 
for the purpose of that analysis  an appropriate amount of capital equity is allocated to each transaction for determining the transaction s priced return on deployed capital 
subject to an adequate return for the risk level as well as other factors  such as the contribution of each risk to the overall risk level and risk diversification  capital is allocated to the transactions generating the highest priced return on deployed capital 
management s challenge consists of i allocating an appropriate amount of capital to each transaction based on the incremental risk created by the transaction  ii properly estimating the company s overall risk level and the impact of each transaction on the overall risk level  and iii assessing the diversification benefit  if any  of each transaction 
the risk for the company lies in mis estimating any one of these factors  which are critical in calculating a meaningful priced return on deployed capital  and entering into transactions that do not contribute to the company s roe objective 
combined ratio the combined ratio is used industry wide as a measure of underwriting profitability for non life business 
the combined ratio is the sum of the technical ratio losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned and the other operating expense ratio other operating expenses divided by net premiums earned 
a combined ratio under indicates underwriting profitability  as the total losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and other operating expenses are less than the premiums earned on that business 
while an important metric of success  the combined ratio does not reflect all components of profitability  as it does not recognize the impact of interest income earned on premiums between the time premiums are received and the time loss payments are ultimately made to clients 
from onwards  the company had seven years of underwriting profitability reflected in combined ratios of less than for its non life segment  with the only exception being in  when the industry recorded its worst year in history in terms of catastrophe losses  with hurricane katrina being the largest insured event ever  the company recorded a net underwriting loss and non life combined ratio of 
the key challenges in managing the combined ratio metric consist of i focusing on underwriting profitable business even in the weaker part of the reinsurance cycle  as opposed to growing the book of business at the cost of profitability  ii diversifying the portfolio to achieve a good balance of business  with the expectation that underwriting losses in certain lines or markets may potentially be offset by underwriting profits in other lines or markets  and iii maintaining control over expenses 

table of contents other key issues of management enterprise culture management is focused on ensuring that the structure and culture of the organization promote intelligent  prudent  transparent and ethical decision making 
management believes that a sound enterprise culture starts with the tone at the top 
the executive management holds regular company wide information sessions to present and review management s latest decisions  whether operational  financial or structural  as well as the financial results of the company 
employees are encouraged to address questions related to the company s results  strategy or management decisions  either anonymously or otherwise to management so that they can be answered during these information sessions 
management believes that these sessions provide a consistent message to all employees about the company s value of transparency 
management also strives to promote a work environment that i aligns the skill set of individuals with challenges encountered by the company  ii includes segregation of duties to ensure objectivity in decision making  and iii provides a compensation structure that encourages and rewards intelligent and ethical behavior 
to that effect  the company has a written code of business conduct and ethics and provides employees with a direct communication channel to the audit committee in the event they become aware of questionable behavior of management or anyone else 
finally  management believes that building a sound internal control environment  including a strong internal audit function  helps ensure that behaviors are consistent with the company s cultural values 
capital adequacy a key challenge for management is to maintain an appropriate level of capital  especially in light of the recent disruptions in the global credit and capital markets 
management s first priority is to hold sufficient capital to meet all of the company s obligations to cedants  meet regulatory requirements and support its position as one of the stronger reinsurers in the industry 
holding an excessive amount of capital  however  will reduce the company s roe 
consequently  management closely monitors its capital needs and capital level throughout the cycle and in times of volatility and turmoil in global capital markets  and actively takes steps to increase or decrease the company s capital in order to achieve the proper balance of financial strength and shareholder returns 
capital management is achieved by either deploying capital to fund attractive business opportunities  or in times of excess capital  returning capital to shareholders by way of share repurchases and dividends 
liquidity and cash flows the company aims to be a reliable and financially secure partner to its cedants 
this means that the company must maintain sufficient liquidity at all times so that it can support its cedants by settling claims quickly 
the company generates cash flows primarily from its underwriting and investment operations 
management believes that a profitable  well run reinsurance organization will generate sufficient cash from premium receipts to pay claims  acquisition costs and operating expenses in most years 
to the extent that underwriting cash flows are not sufficient to cover operating cash outflows in any year  the company may utilize cash flows generated from investments and may ultimately liquidate assets from its investment portfolio 
management ensures that its liquidity requirements are supported by maintaining a high quality  well balanced and liquid investment portfolio  and by matching the duration of its investments and investments underlying the funds held directly managed account with that of its net reinsurance liabilities 
in  the company expects to continue to generate positive operating cash flows  absent a series of unusual catastrophic events 
the company also maintains credit facilities with banks that can provide efficient access to cash in the event of an unforeseen cash requirement 

table of contents risk management a key challenge in the reinsurance industry is to create economic value through the intelligent assumption of reinsurance and capital markets and investment risk  but also to limit or mitigate those risks that can destroy tangible as well as intangible value 
management believes that every organization faces numerous risks that could threaten the successful achievement of a company s goals and objectives 
these include choice of strategy and markets  economic and business cycles  competition  changes in regulation  data quality and security  fraud  business interruption and management continuity  all factors which can be viewed as either strategic or operational risks that are common to any industry 
see risk factors in item a of part i of this report 
in addition to these risks  the company assumes risks and its results are primarily determined by how well the company understands  prices and manages assumed risk 
while many industries and companies start with a return goal and then attempt to shed risks that may derail that goal  the company starts with a capital based risk appetite and then looks for risks that meet its return targets within that framework 
management believes that this construct allows the company to balance the cedants need for absolute certainty of claims payment with the shareholders need for an adequate return on their capital 
the company has a clearly defined governance structure for risk management 
executive management and the board are responsible for setting the vision and goals including risk appetite and return expectations 
strategy and principles are recommended by executive management and approved by the board 
key policies and group policies are established by the chief executive officer and policies at the next level down are established by business unit and functional management 
risk management policies and processes are audited by internal audit and the results of audits are monitored by the audit committee of the board 
strategic risks are managed by executive management and include the direction and governance of the company  as well as its response to key external factors faced by the reinsurance industry 
the company manages assumed risk at a strategic level through diversification  risk appetite  and absolute limits 
for each key risk  the board approves a risk appetite that the company defines as the percentage of economic capital the company is willing to expose to economic loss with a modeled probability of occurring once every years and once every years 
the company manages its exposure to key risks such that the modeled economic loss at a in year and a in year return period are less than the economic capital the company is willing to expose to the key risks at those return periods 
in addition  the risk management and finance committee of the board approve aggregate and absolute risk limits for the key risks 
the company s risk limits are stated as explicit numerical expressions  such as total aggregate limits in a catastrophe zone  earned premium for casualty business  and the market value of equity and equity like securities 
executive and business unit management set additional specific and aggregate risk limits within those limits approved by the risk management and finance committee 
the actual level of risk is dependent on current market conditions and the need for balance in the company s portfolio of risks 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews and reports to the board the actual utilization of limits against approved limits and modeled economic loss against approved appetite for the key risks 
individual business units manage assumed risks  subject to the appetite and principles approved by the board  limits approved by the risk management and finance committee  and policies established by executive and business unit management 
at an operational level  business units manage assumed risk through risk mitigation strategies including strong processes  technical risk assessment and collaboration among different groups of professionals who each contribute a particular area of expertise 
operational and financial risks are managed by designated functions within the organization 
they include failures or weaknesses in financial reporting and controls  regulatory non compliance  poor cash management  fraud  breach of information technology security and reliance on third party vendors 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through robust processes and controls 
controls and monitoring processes throughout the organization seek to ensure that the executive management and the board have a comprehensive view of the company s risks and related mitigation strategies at all times 

table of contents the major risks to the company s balance sheet are typically due to events that management refers to as shock losses 
the company defines a shock loss as an event that has the potential to materially damage economic value 
the company defines its economic value as the difference between the net present value of tangible assets and the net present value of liabilities  using appropriate risk discount rates  plus the unrecognized value of our life portfolio 
for traded assets  the calculated net present values are equivalent to market values 
there are three areas of risk that the company has currently identified as having the greatest potential for shock losses catastrophe  reserving for casualty and other long tail lines  and equity and equity like investment risk 
the company manages the risk of shock losses by setting risk appetite and limits as described above for each type of shock loss 
the company establishes limits to manage the absolute maximum foreseeable loss from any one event and considers the possibility that several shock losses could occur at one time  for example a major catastrophe event accompanied by a collapse in the equity markets 
management believes that the limits that it has placed on shock losses will allow the company to continue writing business should such an event occur 
other risks such as interest rate risk and credit spread risk have the ability to impact results substantially and may result in volatility in results from quarter to quarter  but management believes that by themselves  they are unlikely to represent a material downside threat to the company s long term economic value 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this report for additional disclosure on interest rate risk  credit spread risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
the company seeks to maintain a risk appetite moderately above the average of the reinsurance market because management believes that this position offers the best potential for creating shareholder value at an acceptable risk level 
the most profitable products generally present the most volatility and potential downside risk 
management believes that the company s actual risk profile is equal to or less than the average of the reinsurance market because of the level of diversification achieved in the portfolio  the strict adherence to risk appetite and limits  and the risk mitigation strategies employed 
catastrophe risk the company defines this risk as the risk that the aggregate losses from natural perils materially exceed the net premiums that are received to cover such risks 
the company considers both the loss of capital due to a single large event and the loss of capital that would occur from multiple but potentially smaller events in any year 
the company imposes an absolute limit to catastrophe risk from any single loss through exposure limit caps in each zone and to each peril 
limits from catastrophe exposed business include limits on both reinsurance treaties and insurance linked securities 
the company also manages its catastrophe exposures such that the chance of an economic loss to the company from all catastrophe losses in aggregate in any one year exceeding billion has a modeled probability of occurring less than once every years 
to measure this probability  the company uses proprietary models that take into account not only the exposures in any zone  but also the likely frequency and severity of catastrophic events 
this quantitative analysis is supplemented with the professional judgment of experienced underwriters 
at december   the modeled economic loss to the company from a in year catastrophic loss was billion  in aggregate  for all zones 
catastrophe risk is managed through the real time allocation of catastrophe exposure capacity in each exposure zone to different business units  regular modeling of aggregate loss scenarios through proprietary models and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis 
a zone is a geographic area in which the insurance risks are considered to be correlated to a single catastrophic event 
not all zones have the same limit and zones are broadly defined so that it would be highly unlikely for any single event to substantially erode the aggregate exposure limits from more than one zone 
even extremely high severity low likelihood events will only partially exhaust the limits in any zone  as they are likely to only affect a part of the area covered by a wide zone 

table of contents casualty reserving risk the company defines this risk as the risk that the estimates of ultimate losses that underlie its booked reserves for casualty and other long tail lines will prove to be too low  leading to substantial reserve strengthening 
one of the greatest risks in long tail lines of business  and particularly in us casualty  is that the loss trends are higher than the assumptions underlying the company s ultimate loss estimates  resulting in ultimate losses that exceed recorded loss reserves 
when loss trends prove to be higher than those underlying the reserving assumptions  the risk is great because of a stacking up effect for long tail lines  the company carries reserves to cover claims arising from several years of underwriting activity and these reserves are likely to be adversely affected by unfavorable loss trends 
the effect is likely to be more pronounced for recent underwriting years because  with the passage of time  actual loss emergence and data provide greater confidence around the adequacy of ultimate liability estimates for older underwriting years 
management believes that the volume of long tail business most exposed to these reserving uncertainties should be limited 
the company limits the total earned premiums for casualty and other long tail lines for the four most recent underwriting periods 
the company also manages its casualty and other long tail lines exposure such that the chance of an economic loss to the company from prior years deterioration in casualty and other long tail reserves exceeding million has a modeled probability of occurring less than once every years 
to measure this probability  the company uses proprietary models that contemplate the range of possible reserve outcomes given historic volatility of the company s and industry reserve development data and the possible impacts upon the range of reserves of risk factors inherent in the current booked reserves 
this quantitative analysis is supplemented with the professional judgment of experienced actuaries 
at december   the modeled economic loss to the company from a in year casualty and other long tail lines prior years reserve development was million 
the company manages and mitigates the reserving risk for long tail lines in a variety of ways 
underwriters and pricing actuaries follow a disciplined underwriting process that utilizes all available data and information  including industry trends  and the company establishes prudent reserving policies for determining carried reserves 
these policies are systematic and management endeavors to apply them consistently over time 
see critical accounting policies and estimates losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits below 
equity investment risk the company defines this risk as the risk of a substantial decline in the value of its equity and equity like securities 
the company defines equity and equity like securities as the market value of all assets that are not investment grade fixed income 
the company limits the amount of equity and equity like securities to a percentage of economic capital 
the company also manages its equity and equity like exposures such that the chance of an economic loss to the company of a severe decline in value of equity and equity like securities exceeding billion has a modeled probability of occurring less than once every years 
to measure this probability  the company uses proprietary and vendor models that contemplate the range of historic and possible future returns 
this quantitative analysis is supplemented with the professional judgment of experienced investment professionals and actuaries 
at december   the modeled economic loss to the company from a in year equity and equity like value decline was million 
assuming equity risk and equity like risks such as high yield bonds and convertible securities within that part of the investment portfolio that is not required to support the company s reinsurance liabilities provides valuable diversification from other risk classes  along with the potential for higher returns 
however  an overweight position could lead to a large loss of capital and impair the balance sheet in the case of a market crash 
the company sets strict limits on investments in any one name and any one industry  which creates a diversified portfolio and allows management to focus on the systemic effects of equity risks 
systemic risk is managed by asset allocation  subject to strict caps on other than investment grade bonds as a percentage of 
table of contents capital 
the company s fully integrated information system provides real time data on the investment portfolios  allowing for continuous monitoring and decision support

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgment 
if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and estimates used by management  there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
these critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with the company s notes to consolidated financial statements  including note  significant accounting policies  for a full understanding of the company s accounting policies 
the sensitivity estimates that follow are based on outcomes that the company considers reasonably likely to occur 
losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits losses and loss expenses because a significant amount of time can elapse between the assumption of risk  occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance company the primary company or the cedant  the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company the reinsurer and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer  the company s liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses loss reserves is based largely upon estimates 
the company categorizes loss reserves into three types of reserves reported outstanding loss reserves case reserves  additional case reserves acrs and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the company s cedants and recorded by the company 
acrs are established for particular circumstances where  on the basis of individual loss reports  the company estimates that the particular loss or collection of losses covered by a treaty may be greater than those advised by the cedant 
ibnr reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company  as well as future loss development on losses already reported  in excess of the case reserves and acrs 
unlike case reserves and acrs  ibnr reserves are often calculated at an aggregated level and cannot usually be directly identified as reserves for a particular loss or treaty 
the company updates its estimates for each of the 
table of contents aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants 
the company also estimates the future unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae associated with the loss reserves and these form part of the company s loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company s non life loss reserves for each category  line and sub segment are reported in the tables included later in this section 
the amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail 
lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines  and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long tail lines 
in general  for reinsurance  the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer s 
the delay varies by reinsurance market country of cedant  type of treaty  whether losses are first paid by the cedant and the size of the loss 
the delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer 
the company considers agriculture  catastrophe  energy  property  motor business written in the us  proportional motor business written outside of the us  specialty property and structured risk to be short tail lines  aviation space  credit surety  engineering  marine and multiline to be medium tail lines  and casualty  non proportional motor business written outside of the us and specialty casualty to be long tail lines of business 
for all lines  the company s objective is to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses 
total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid 
similarly  ibnr reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves and acrs from total loss reserves 
the company analyzes its ultimate losses and loss expenses after consideration of the loss experience of various reserving cells 
the company assigns treaties to reserving cells and allocates losses from the treaty to the reserving cell 
the reserving cells are selected in order to ensure that the underlying treaties have homogeneous loss development characteristics eg  reporting tail but are large enough to make estimation of trends credible 
the selection of reserving cells is reviewed annually and changes over time as the business of the company evolves 
for each reserving cell  the company tabulates losses in reserving triangles that show the total reported or paid claims at each financial year end by underwriting year cohort 
an underwriting year is the year during which the reinsurance treaty was entered into as opposed to the year in which the loss occurred accident year  or the calendar year for which financial results are reported 
for each reserving cell  the company s estimates of loss reserves are reached after a review of the results of several commonly accepted actuarial projection methodologies 
in selecting its best estimate  the company considers the appropriateness of each methodology to the individual circumstances of the cell and underwriting year for which the projection is made 
the methodologies that the company employs include  but may not be limited to  paid and reported chain ladder methods  expected loss ratio method  paid and reported bornhuetter ferguson b f methods  and paid and reported benktander methods 
in addition  the company uses other methodologies to estimate liabilities for specific types of claims 
for example  internal and vendor catastrophe models are typically used in the estimation of loss and loss expenses at the early stages of catastrophe losses before loss information is reported to the reinsurer 
in the case of asbestos and environmental claims  the company has established reserves for future losses and allocated loss expenses based on the results of periodic actuarial studies  which consider the underlying exposures of the company s cedants 
the reserve methodologies employed by the company are dependent on data that the company collects 
this data consists primarily of loss amounts and loss payments reported by the company s cedants  and premiums written and earned reported by cedants or estimated by the company 
the actuarial methods used by the company to project loss reserves that it will pay in the future future liabilities do not generally include methodologies that are dependent on claim counts reported  claim counts settled or claim counts open as  due to the nature of the company s business  this information is not routinely provided by cedants for every treaty 
consequently  actuarial methods relying on this information cannot be used by the company to estimate loss reserves 

table of contents a brief description of the reserving methods commonly employed by the company and a discussion of their particular advantages and disadvantages follows chain ladder cl development methods reported or paid these methods use the underlying assumption that losses reported paid for each underwriting year at a particular development stage follow a stable pattern 
for example  the cl development method assumes that on average  every underwriting year will display the same percentage of ultimate liabilities reported by the company s cedants say x at months after the inception of the underwriting year 
the percentages reported paid are established for each development stage eg  at months  months  etc 
after examining historical averages from the loss development data 
these are sometimes supplemented by external benchmark information 
ultimate liabilities are estimated by multiplying the actual reported paid losses by the reciprocal of the assumed reported paid percentage eg  x 
reserves are then calculated by subtracting paid claims from the estimated ultimate liabilities 
the main strengths of the method are that it is reactive to loss emergence payments and that it makes full use of historical experience on claim emergence payments 
for homogeneous low volatility lines  under stable economic conditions the method can often produce good estimates of ultimate liabilities and reserves 
however  the method has weaknesses when the underlying assumption of stable patterns is not true 
this may be the consequence of changes in the mix of business  changes in claim inflation trends  changes in claim reporting practices or the presence of large claims  among other things 
furthermore  the method tends to produce volatile estimates of ultimate liabilities in situations where there is volatility in reported paid patterns 
in particular  when the expected percentage reported paid is low  small deviations between actual and expected claims can lead to very volatile estimates of ultimate liabilities and reserves 
consequently  this method is often unsuitable for projections at early development stages of an underwriting year 
finally  the method fails to incorporate any information regarding market conditions  pricing  etc  which could improve the estimate of liabilities and reserves 
it therefore tends not to perform very well in situations where there are rapidly changing market conditions 
expected loss ratio elr method this method estimates ultimate losses for an underwriting year by applying an estimated loss ratio to the earned premium for that underwriting year 
although the method is insensitive to actual reported or paid losses  it can often be useful at the early stages of development when very few losses have been reported or paid  and the principal sources of information available to the company consist of information obtained during pricing and qualitative information supplied by the cedant 
however  the lack of sensitivity to reported or paid losses means that the method is usually inappropriate at later stages of development 
bornhuetter ferguson b f methods reported or paid these methods aim to address the concerns of the chain ladder development methods  which are the variability at early stages of development and the failure to incorporate external information such as pricing 
however  the b f methods are more sensitive to reported and paid losses than the expected loss ratio method  and can be seen as a blend of the expected loss ratio and chain ladder development methods 
unreported unpaid claims are calculated using an expected reporting payment pattern and an externally determined estimate of ultimate liabilities usually determined by multiplying an a priori loss ratio with estimates of premium volume 
the accuracy of the a priori loss ratio is a critical assumption in this method 
usually a priori loss ratios are initially determined on the basis of pricing information  but may also be adjusted to reflect other information that subsequently emerges about underlying loss experience 
although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment  this method can be slow to react to emerging loss development payment 
in particular  to the extent that the a priori loss ratios prove to be inaccurate and are not revised  the b f methods will produce loss estimates that take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss liabilities 

table of contents benktander b k methods reported or paid these methods can be viewed as a blend between the chain ladder development and the b f methods described above 
the blend is based on predetermined weights at each development stage that depend on the reported paid development patterns 
although mitigated to some extent  this method still exhibits the same advantages and disadvantages as the b f method  but the mechanics of the calculation imply that it is more reactive to loss emergence payment than the b f method 
in determining the company s loss reserves  the selected best estimate is often a blend of the results from two or more methods eg  weighted averages 
the judgment as to which method s is most appropriate for a particular underwriting year and reserving cell could change over time as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other data issues 
furthermore  as each line is typically composed of several reserving cells  it is likely that the reserves for the line will be dependent on several reserving methods 
this is because reserves for a line are the result of aggregating the reserves for each constituent reserving cell and that a different method could be selected for each reserving cell 
although it is not appropriate to refer to reserves for a line as being determined by a particular method  the table below summarizes the methods that were given principal weight in selecting the best estimates of reserves in each reserving line and can therefore be viewed as key drivers of selected reserves 
the table distinguishes methods for mature and immature underwriting years  as they are often different 
the definition of maturity is specific to a line and is related to the reporting tail 
if at the reserve evaluation date  a significant proportion of losses for the underwriting year are expected to have been reported  then the underwriting year is deemed to be mature  otherwise it is deemed to be immature 
for short tail lines  such as property or agriculture  immature years can refer to the one or two most recent underwriting years  while for longer tail lines  such as casualty  immature years can refer to the three or four most recent underwriting years 
to the extent that the principal reserving methods used for major components of a reserving line are different  these are separately identified in the table below

the company s approach to estimating its ultimate losses for lines impacted by the deteriorating financial condition of the world economies in and the first half of is discussed below 

table of contents the reserving methods used by the company are dependent on a number of key parameter assumptions 
the principal parameter assumptions underlying the methods used by the company are i the loss development factors used to form an expectation of the evolution of reported and paid claims for several years following the inception of the underwriting year 
these are often derived by examining the company s data after due consideration of the underlying factors listed below 
in some cases  where the company lacks sufficient volume to have statistical credibility  external benchmarks are used to supplement the company s data  ii the tail factors used to reflect development of paid and reported losses after several years have elapsed since the inception of the underwriting year  iii the a priori loss ratios used as inputs in the b f methods  and iv the selected loss ratios used as inputs in the expected loss ratio method 
the validity of all parameter assumptions used in the reserving process is reaffirmed on a quarterly basis 
reaffirmation of the parameter assumptions means that the actuaries determine that the parameter assumptions continue to form a sound basis for projection of future liabilities 
parameter assumptions used in projecting future liabilities are themselves estimates based on historical information 
as new information becomes available eg  additional losses reported  the company s actuaries determine whether a revised estimate of the parameter assumptions that reflects all available information is consistent with the previous parameter assumptions employed 
in general  to the extent that the revised estimate of the parameter assumptions are within a close range of the original assumptions  the company determines that the parameter assumptions employed continue to form an appropriate basis for projections and continue to use the original assumptions in its models 
in this case  any differences could be attributed to the imprecise nature of the parameter estimation process 
however  to the extent that the deviations between the two sets of estimates are not within a close range of the original assumptions  the company reacts by adopting the revised assumptions as a basis for its reserve models 
notwithstanding the above  even where the company has experienced no material deviations from its original assumptions during any quarter  the company will generally revise the reserving parameter assumptions at least once a year to reflect all accumulated available information 
in addition to examining the data  the selection of the parameter assumptions is dependent on several underlying factors 
the company s actuaries review these underlying factors and determine the extent to which these are likely to be stable over the time frame during which losses are projected  and the extent to which these factors are consistent with the company s data 
if these factors are determined to be stable and consistent with the data  the estimation of the reserving parameter assumptions are mainly carried out using actuarial and statistical techniques applied to the company s data 
to the extent that the actuaries determine that they cannot continue to rely on the stability of these factors  the statistical estimates of parameter assumptions are modified to reflect the direction of the change 
the main underlying factors upon which the estimates of reserving parameters are predicated are i the cedant s business practices will proceed as in the past with no material changes either in submission of accounts or cash flows  ii any internal delays in processing accounts received by the cedant are not materially different from that experienced historically  and hence the implicit reserving allowance made in loss reserves through the methods continues to be appropriate  iii case reserve reporting practices  particularly the methodologies used to establish and report case reserves  are unchanged from historical practices  iv the company s internal claim practices  particularly the level and extent of use of acrs are unchanged  v historical levels of claim inflation can be projected into the future and will have no material effect on either the acceleration or deceleration of claim reporting and payment patterns  
table of contents vi the selection of reserving cells results in homogeneous and credible future expectations for all business in the cell and any changes in underlying treaty terms are either reflected in cell selection or explicitly allowed in the selection of trends  vii in cases where benchmarks are used  they are derived from the experience of similar business  and viii the company can form a credible initial expectation of the ultimate loss ratio of recent underwriting years through a review of pricing information  supplemented by qualitative information on market events 
the company s best estimate of total loss reserves is typically in excess of the midpoint of the actuarial reserve estimates 
the company believes that there is potentially significant risk in estimating loss reserves for long tail lines of business and for immature underwriting years that may not be adequately captured through traditional actuarial projection methodologies 
as discussed above  these methodologies usually rely heavily on projections of prior year trends into the future 
in selecting its best estimate of future liabilities  the company considers both the results of actuarial point estimates of loss reserves as well as the potential variability of these estimates as captured by a reasonable range of actuarial reserve estimates 
the selected best estimates of reserves are always within the indicated reasonable range of estimates indicated by the company s actuaries 
in determining the appropriate best estimate  the company reviews i the position of overall reserves within the actuarial reserve range  ii the result of bottom up analysis by underwriting year reflecting the impact of parameter uncertainty in actuarial calculations  and iii specific qualitative information on events that may have an effect on future claims but which may not have been adequately reflected in actuarial mid estimates  such as potential for outstanding litigation  claims practices of cedants  etc

property aggregate losses reported for the us property line were lower than expected  and the company selected reserving methods that gave more weight to the actual development 
losses reported for the non us property line were lower than expected for most years  and the company reflected this experience by using reserving methods that give more weight to the actual development and by lowering its loss ratio picks for those years 
casualty aggregate losses reported and paid for the us and us casualty lines were lower than expected  predominantly for underwriting years  and the company reflected this experience by lowering its loss ratio picks for those underwriting years 
multiline reported losses were significantly higher than expected for underwriting years and and lower than expected for underwriting years and prior 
the company reflected this experience by using reserving methods that give more weight to the actual development 
motor aggregate losses reported for the us motor line were generally lower than expected  except for underwriting years and the company selected higher loss ratios reflecting this development for those specific years  but lowered loss ratio selections for and prior 
aggregate losses reported for the non us motor proportional line were lower than expected for underwriting years and prior and the company reflected this experience by using reserving methods that give more weight to experience 
aggregate losses reported for the non us motor non proportional line were significantly lower than expectations in most countries 
the company reflected this by lowering loss ratio picks in addition to changing loss development assumptions 
agriculture aggregate losses reported during the year for us and non us business were below the company s expectations  primarily for the underwriting year 
the company lowered its loss ratio picks  but did not otherwise materially alter its reserving assumptions 

table of contents aviation space the overall losses reported during the year were significantly lower than the company s expectations for most underwriting years 
the company reflected this experience by selecting faster development patterns and lower loss ratios 
catastrophe losses reported in this line are largely a function of the presence or absence of catastrophic events during the year 
losses reported in respect of prior year catastrophe events were lower than expectations mainly for underwriting year during the year  losses developed more favorably than anticipated for hurricane ike and the company reduced its loss ratio selection for underwriting year credit surety aggregate losses reported during the year were significantly lower than expected in the us and the company reflected this experience by selecting lower loss ratios 
for non us business  loss development for underwriting years and prior was better than expected and loss ratios were reduced to reflect this experience 
for underwriting years and  losses reported during the year were significantly higher than expected 
as a result of this worse than expected development  the company increased loss ratios as well as selected higher a priori loss ratios for these years 
most of the adverse loss reporting from the underwriting year was associated with the current accident year 
therefore  prior year reserves associated with the underwriting year were increased moderately and the current accident year losses incurred associated with the underwriting year reflected the higher than expected level of claim reporting 
engineering aggregate reported losses were significantly lower than expectations 
the company reflected this experience by selecting lower loss ratios and faster development patterns 
energy onshore aggregate reported losses were lower than expected during the year and the company reduced its loss ratios to reflect this experience 
the company did not materially change its reserving assumptions for this line 
marine energy offshore aggregate reported losses during the year were higher than expected due to hurricane ike exposure in underwriting years and however  for underwriting years and prior  losses developed better than expected 
the company reflected the underwriting years and prior favorable experience by relying on more experience based methods and increased the and underwriting years loss ratios to reflect the worse than expected experience 

table of contents as an example of the sensitivity of the company s reserves to reserving parameter assumptions  the tables below summarize  by reserving line  the effect on the company s reserves of higher lower a priori loss ratio selections  higher lower loss development factors and higher lower tail factors 
the company believes that the illustrated sensitivities to the reserving parameter assumptions are indicative of the potential variability inherent in the estimation process of those parameters

some reserving lines show little sensitivity to a priori loss ratio  loss development factor or tail factor as the company may use reserving methods such as the expected loss ratio method in several of its reserving cells within those lines 
it is not appropriate to sum the total impact for a specific factor or the total impact for a specific reserving line as the lines of business are not perfectly correlated

the net loss reserves represent the company s best estimate of future losses and loss expense amounts 
loss reserves are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time to reflect the company s expectations of the costs of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
in the event that the business environment and social trends diverge from historical trends  the company may have to adjust its loss reserves to amounts falling significantly outside its current estimate 
management believes that the recorded loss reserves represent its best estimate of future liabilities based on information available as of december  these estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts provided  for which any adjustments will be reflected in the period in which the need for an adjustment is determined 
the company s best estimates are point estimates within a reasonable range of actuarial reserve estimates 
these ranges are developed using stochastic simulations and techniques and provide an indication as to the degree of variability of the loss reserves 
the company interprets the ranges produced by these techniques as confidence intervals around the point estimates for each non life sub segment 
however  due to the inherent volatility in the business written by the company  there can be no guarantee that the final settlement of the loss reserves will fall within these ranges 

table of contents the point estimates recorded by the company  and the range of actuarial estimates around these point estimates at december  and  were as follows for each non life sub segment in millions of us dollars recorded point estimate high low net non life segment loss reserves us global non us p c global non us specialty catastrophe paris re net non life segment loss reserves us global non us p c global non us specialty catastrophe it is not appropriate to add together the ranges of each sub segment in an effort to determine a high and low range around the company s total non life carried loss reserves 
of the  million of net loss reserves for paris re  the company considers only  million of net loss reserves for accident years and subsequent to be subject to loss reserve variability 
the remaining  million of net loss reserves for accident years and prior are guaranteed by colis e re  pursuant to the reserve agreement 
see summary of certain agreements between axa sa  colis e re and paris re in item of part i of this report 
the deteriorating financial condition of the world economies in and first half of has increased the expectation of losses and increased the degree of uncertainty related to the range of possible ultimate liabilities for several classes of business that are exposed to the effects of financial stress 
a significant degree of judgment was used to estimate the range of potential losses and there is a considerable degree of uncertainty related to the range of possible ultimate liabilities 
based on information currently available and the range of potential estimated ultimate liabilities  the company believes that the unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for us and global us specialty casualty  us  global us and paris re credit surety lines of business and other potentially exposed classes of business contemplate a reasonable provision for exposures related to the effect of increased financial stress in the world economies 
the company is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its unpaid loss and loss expenses estimates related to this exposure 
the company s gross unpaid losses and loss expenses reserves at december  for us and global non us specialty casualty for underwriting years through were billion 
the company s unpaid losses and loss expenses reserves at december  for us  global us and paris re credit surety for underwriting years through were million 
included in the business that is considered to have a long reporting tail is the company s exposure to asbestos and environmental claims 
the company s net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december  included million that represents estimates of its net ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims 
the gross liability for such claims at december  was million 
the increase in asbestos and environmental claims reserves is due to the acquisition of paris re 
the company s gross liability for paris re s asbestos and environmental claims at december  of million relates to pre accident years and any favorable or adverse development is subject to the reserve agreement 
of the remaining million in gross reserves  the majority of the reserves relate to us casualty exposures arising from business written by partnerre sa and partnerre us 
table of contents ultimate loss estimates for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques and there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses for these claims 
in view of the legal and tort environment that affect the development of such claims  the uncertainties inherent in estimating asbestos and environmental claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
there can be no assurance that the reserves established by the company will not be adversely affected by development of other latent exposures  and further  there can be no assurance that the reserves established by the company will be adequate 
the company does  however  actively evaluate potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and establishes additional reserves as appropriate 
the company believes that it has made a reasonable provision for these exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its unpaid losses and loss expense reserves related to this exposure see note to consolidated financial statements 
life policy benefits policy benefits for life and annuity contracts relate to the business in the company s life operations  which predominately includes reinsurance of longevity  subdivided into standard and non standard annuities  and mortality business  which includes traditional death and disability covers with various riders  term assurance and critical illness tci written in the uk and ireland  and guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb written in continental europe 
the company categorizes life reserves into three types of reserves reported outstanding loss reserves case reserves  incurred but not reported ibnr reserves and reserves for future policy benefits 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the company s cedants and recorded by the company 
ibnr reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company  as well as future loss development on losses already reported  in excess of the case reserves 
reserves for future policy benefits  which relate to future events occurring on policies in force over an extended period of time  are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with us gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of reserves for future policy benefits have been determined based upon information reported by ceding companies  supplemented by the company s actuarial estimates of mortality  critical illness  persistency and future investment income  with appropriate provision to reflect uncertainty 
for the traditional life portfolio  case reserves  ibnr reserves and reserves for future policy benefits are mainly calculated at the treaty level 
the company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants 
for long duration products  a reserve adequacy test is periodically performed based on the latest best estimate assumptions by line of business  including an experience analysis and a review of likely future experience 
if such review produces reserves in excess of those currently held  then the locked in assumptions will be revised and a loss recognized 
longevity the reserves for the annuity portfolio of reinsurance contracts within the longevity book are established in accordance with the provisions for long duration insurance contracts under us gaap 
many of these contracts subject the company to risks arising from policyholder mortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected 
annuity payments and expenses for policies within the annuity reinsurance portfolio are projected over the lifetime of the contract to calculate a net present value of future cash flows 
assumptions for each element mortality  expenses and interest are determined at the issue of the contract and are locked in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists 
the assumptions are best estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements ie  mortality and interest 
provisions for adverse deviation are designed to cover reasonable deviations from the best estimate outcome of the contract 

table of contents for standard annuities  the main risk is a faster increase in future life span than expected in the medium to long term 
non standard annuities are annuities sold to people with aggravated health conditions and are usually medically underwritten on an individual basis 
the main risk in non standard annuities is an inadequate assessment of the future life span of the people insured 
for the year ended december   the company increased net prior year reserves by million due to changes in the best estimate of future mortality assumptions 
for the year ended december   the company increased net prior year reserves by million as a result of higher losses reported by cedants 
mortality the reserves for the short term traditional mortality business are established in accordance with the provisions for short duration insurance contracts under us gaap 
they consist of case reserves and ibnr  calculated at the treaty level based upon cedant information and use the expected loss ratio method  described in the losses and loss expenses section above 
given the very short term loss development of this portion of the portfolio  this method is appropriate 
the reserves for the long term traditional mortality and tci reinsurance portfolio are established in accordance with the provisions for long duration insurance contracts under us gaap 
assumptions for each element mortality  critical illness  lapses  expenses and interest are determined at the issue of the contract and are locked in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists 
the assumptions are best estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements ie mortality  critical illness  lapses and interest 
the reserves for the gmdb reinsurance business are established in accordance with the provisions for universal life contracts under us gaap 
key assumptions for this business are mortality  lapses  interest rates  credit spreads and stock market performance 
for the last parameter  a stochastic option pricing approach is used and the benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios 
the assumptions of investment performance and volatility are consistent with the historical experience of the respective underlying funds correlated to the eurostoxx or the cac index 
the company regularly evaluates the assumptions used and adjusts them if actual experience or other evidence suggests that the earlier assumptions should be revised 
for the year ended december   the company decreased net prior year reserves by million 
the reserve decrease predominately resulted from favorable financial markets impacts on the gmdb portfolio 
with regard to the gmdb portfolio  the recovery in the capital markets resulted in a million decrease in future policy benefits on capital markets linked products 
the other mortality products long term  short term  and tci business experienced better than expected loss development in the year  resulting in a prior year reserve decrease of million 
for the year ended december   the company increased net prior year reserves by million  predominately due to adverse reserve development on certain gmdb treaties

table of contents total reserves for future policy benefits include provisions for adverse deviation of million at december  as an example of the sensitivity of the company s policy benefits for life and annuity contracts to reserving parameter assumptions  the table below summarizes  by reserving line  the effect of different assumption selections 
reserving lines factors change impact on total life reserves in million of us dollars longevity impaired life annuity life expectancy year other annuities mortality improvements per annum mortality long term and tci mortality gmdb stock market performance it is not appropriate to sum the total impact for a specific reserving line or the total impact for a specific factor because the reinsurance portfolios are not perfectly correlated 
premiums and acquisition costs the company provides proportional and non proportional reinsurance coverage to cedants insurance companies 
in most cases  cedants seek protection for business that they have not yet written at the time they enter into reinsurance agreements and thus have to estimate the volume of premiums they will cede to the company 
reporting delays are inherent in the reinsurance industry and vary in length by reinsurance market country of cedant and type of treaty 
as delays can vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer  the company produces accounting estimates to report premiums and acquisition costs until it receives the cedants actual results 
approximately   and of the company s reported net premiums written for  and  respectively  were based upon estimates 
under proportional treaties  which represented of gross premiums written for the year ended december   the company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant and pays the cedant a commission to cover the cedant s acquisition costs 
under this type of treaty  the company s ultimate premiums written and earned and acquisition costs are not known at the inception of the treaty and must be estimated until the cedant reports its actual results to the company 
under non proportional treaties  which represented of gross premiums written for the year december   the company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio and receives a fixed or minimum premium  which is subject to upward adjustment depending on the premium volume written by the cedant 
reported premiums written and earned and acquisition costs on proportional treaties are generally based upon reports received from cedants and brokers  supplemented by the company s own estimates of premiums written and acquisition costs for which ceding company reports have not been received 
premium and acquisition cost estimates are determined at the individual treaty level 
the determination of estimates requires a review of the company s experience with cedants  familiarity with each geographic market  a thorough understanding of the individual characteristics of each line of business and the ability to project the impact of current economic indicators on the volume of business written and ceded by the company s cedants 
estimates for premiums and acquisition costs are updated continuously as new information is received from the cedants 
differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined 
the magnitude and impact of a change in premium estimate differs for proportional and non proportional treaties 
non proportional treaties generally include a fixed minimum premium and an adjustment premium  which is generally less than of the fixed minimum premium 
while fixed minimum premiums require no 
table of contents estimation  adjustment premiums are estimated and could be subject to changes in estimates 
although proportional treaties may be subject to larger changes in premium estimates  as the company generally receives cedant statements in arrears and must estimate all premiums for periods ranging from one month to more than one year depending on the frequency of cedant statements  the pre tax impact is mitigated by changes in the cedant s related reported acquisition costs and losses 
the impact of the change in estimate on premiums earned and pre tax results varies depending on when the change becomes known during the risk period and the underlying profitability of the treaty 
for the year ended december   the company recorded reductions of million and million in net premiums written and net premiums earned  respectively  related to changes in non life premium estimates of prior year reported premiums 
these reductions  after the corresponding adjustments to acquisition costs and losses and loss expenses  had no material impact on consolidated pre tax income 
however  these adjustments for the year ended december  are the result of offsetting impacts in the company s non life sub segments 
the company s us  global us p c and catastrophe sub segments reported combined decreases in net premiums written and net premiums earned of million and million  respectively  which were partially offset by the global non us specialty and paris re sub segments  which reported increases in net premiums written and net premiums earned of million and million  respectively 
a increase decrease in net premium written estimates and the corresponding acquisition costs for all of the company s non life non proportional treaties would increase decrease the pre tax income by approximately million  assuming the changes become known at the mid point of the risk period 
for proportional treaties  the impact of a change in net premium written estimates on pre tax income varies depending on the losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs of the treaties affected by the change 
for example  a increase decrease in net premiums written and the corresponding acquisition costs and losses in across all non life proportional treaties would increase decrease pre tax income by approximately million  applying the reported technical ratio and assuming that the changes become known at the mid point of the risk period 
a increase decrease in acquisition costs for all of the company s non life treaties both proportional and non proportional for the year ended december   would decrease increase pre tax income by approximately million  assuming no change in premium estimates and that the changes become known at the mid point of the risk period 
acquisition costs  primarily brokerage fees  commissions and excise taxes  which vary directly with  and are primarily related to  the acquisition of reinsurance contracts  are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium is earned 
the recovery of deferred policy acquisition costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
deferred policy acquisition costs recoverability testing is performed periodically together with the reserve adequacy test  based on the latest best estimate assumptions by line of business 
income taxes under us gaap  a deferred tax asset or liability is to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
us gaap also establishes procedures to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established for deferred tax assets 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a deferred tax asset 
management must use its judgment in considering the relative impact of positive and negative evidence 
the company also establishes tax liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions as defined under us gaap 
see note l and note to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
the company has estimated the future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and has a deferred tax asset at december  of million 
the most significant components of the deferred tax asset relate to 
table of contents loss reserve discounting for tax purposes and capital tax loss carryforwards in the united states 
at december   the deferred tax asset relating to the us tax loss carryforwards was million  and is subject to a year carryforward period 
the company has projected future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise 
these projections are based on management s projections of premium and investment income  capital gains and losses  and technical and expense ratios 
based on these projections  management evaluates the need for a valuation allowance 
the company did not have any valuation allowance at december  or a decrease in the deferred tax asset of million as of december  would result in a million charge to net income and a corresponding decrease in total assets 
the deferred tax liabilities as of december  were million 
in accordance with us gaap  the company has assumed that the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities will result in an increase in taxes payable in future years 
underlying this assumption is an expectation that the company will continue to be subject to taxation in the various tax jurisdictions and that the company will continue to generate taxable revenues in excess of deductions 
a increase in the deferred tax liability as of december  would result in a million charge to net income and a corresponding increase in total liabilities 
the company s unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was a liability of million at december  a increase in the unrecognized tax benefit as of december  would result in a million charge to net income and a corresponding increase in total liabilities 
valuation of investments and funds held directly managed  including certain derivative financial instruments effective january   the company adopted fair value measurements guidance under us gaap 
fair value is the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the company measures the fair value of financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company s assumptions about what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the level in the hierarchy within which a given fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement 
the company must determine the appropriate level in the hierarchy for each financial instrument that it measures at fair value 
in determining fair value  the company uses various valuation approaches  including market  income and cost approaches 
see note to consolidated financial statements for more detail on the valuation techniques  methods and assumptions that were used by the company to estimate the fair value of its fixed maturities and short term investments  equities  other invested assets and its fixed maturities  short term investments and certain other assets underlying the funds held directly managed account 
see note to consolidated financial statements for more discussion of the company s use of derivative financial instruments 
the company records all of its fixed maturity and equity investments  certain other invested assets  including derivative financial instruments  and its fixed maturities  short term investments and certain other invested assets underlying the funds held directly managed account at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets 
the changes in fair value of all of the company s investments  carried at fair value  are recorded in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and are included in the determination of net income in the period in which they are recorded 

table of contents under the fair value hierarchy  management uses certain assumptions and judgments to derive the fair value of its investments  particularly for those assets with significant unobservable inputs  commonly referred to as level assets 
at december   the company had million of level assets  including fixed maturities million  equities million  other invested assets million and investments underlying the funds held directly managed account million 
for the company s level fixed maturities  equities  other invested assets and investments underlying the funds held directly managed account  a decline in the fair value of these investments would result in an million pre tax charge to income and a corresponding reduction total assets 
included in other invested assets  the company has various loans receivable totaling million at december  in addition  included in the company s other invested assets are entities which are accounted for using the cost method of accounting  equity method of accounting and investments for which the company uses investment company accounting  totaling million at december  the company does not measure its investments that are accounted for using the cost method of accounting  equity method of accounting or investment company accounting at fair value 
for loans receivable and investments that are accounted for using the cost method of accounting  equity method of accounting and investment company accounting  a decline in the carrying value of these investments would result in a million pre tax charge to income and a corresponding reduction in investments and total assets 
the company utilizes derivatives for a variety of purposes  as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
the company s derivatives are carried at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices or internal valuation models where quoted market prices are not available 
the company has entered into a longevity total return swap and other total return swaps 
included in the level other invested assets is a longevity total return swap with net unrealized result of nil on notional exposure of million and a total return swap portfolio with unrealized losses of million on notional exposure of million 
in aggregate  the company is not significantly exposed to changes in the valuation of its total return and interest rate swap portfolio due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
however  at december   the company estimated that a basis point increase or decrease in all risk spread assumptions used in the company s internal valuation models would result in a million decrease or a million increase  respectively  in the fair value of its total return and interest rate swap portfolio 
the company is exposed to changes in the expected amount of future cash flows of the reference assets in its total return swap portfolio 
the company s total return swap portfolio references many different underlying assets with a number of risk factors 
at december   the notional value of the total return swap portfolio was million and the fair value of the assets underlying the total return swap portfolio was million 
the company estimated that each increase or decrease in the amount of all expected future cash flows related to the reference assets would result in a million increase or decrease  respectively  in the fair value of its total return swap portfolio 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of partnerre sa  winterthur re and paris re 
the company assesses the appropriateness of its valuation of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
if  as a result of the assessment  the company determines that the value of its goodwill is impaired  goodwill will be written down in the period in which the determination is made 
the company has established september as the date for performing its annual impairment test 
neither the company s initial valuation nor its subsequent valuations has indicated any impairment of the company s goodwill asset of million as of december  
table of contents in making an assessment of the value of its goodwill  the company uses both market based and non market based valuations 
assumptions underlying these valuations include an analysis of the company s stock price relative to both its book value and its net income in addition to forecasts of future cash flows and future profits 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the company s goodwill asset 
in addition  if the current economic environment and or the company s financial performance were to deteriorate significantly  this could lead to an impairment of goodwill  the write off of which would be recorded against net income in the period such deterioration occurred 
intangible assets intangible assets represent the fair value adjustments related to unpaid losses and loss expenses and unearned premiums  as well as the fair values of renewal rights and us licenses all arising from the acquisition of paris re 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives  generally ranging from two to eleven years 
the company recognizes the amortization of all intangible assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization 
the carrying values of intangible assets are regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment 
impairment is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible assets is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value 
based upon the company s assessment  there was no impairment of its intangible assets of million as of december  results of operations the following discussion of results of operations contains forward looking statements based upon assumptions and expectations concerning the potential effect of future events that are subject to uncertainties 
see item a of part i of this report for a complete list of the company s risk factors 
any of these risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company s significant subsidiaries and branches have one of the following functional currencies us dollar  euro or canadian dollar 
as a significant portion of the company s operations is transacted in foreign currencies  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may affect year over year comparisons 
to the extent that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect comparisons  their impact has been quantified  when possible  and discussed in each of the relevant sections 
see note m to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of translation of foreign currencies 
the foreign exchange fluctuations for the principal currencies in which the company transacts business were as follows the us dollar average exchange rate was stronger against most currencies in compared to and was weaker against most currencies  except the british pound  in compared to  and the us dollar ending exchange rate weakened against most currencies at december  compared to december  and strengthened against the british pound  euro and canadian dollar and weakened against the swiss franc at december  compared to december  overview the company measures its performance in several ways 
among the performance measures accepted under us gaap is diluted net income per share  a measure that focuses on the return provided to the company s common shareholders 
diluted net income per share is obtained by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding 
net income available to common shareholders is defined as net income less preferred dividends 

table of contents the year over year comparison of the company s results is primarily affected by the acquisition of paris re in  losses related to large catastrophic events in  the effects of the global financial and economic crisis in and and the reclassification of the company s available for sale securities to trading securities  resulting in all changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations effective january  to the extent that these events have affected the year over year comparison of the company s results  their impact has been quantified and discussed in each of the relevant sections 
an overview of each of these events is provided below 
the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  include the results of paris re for the period from october   the date of acquisition of the controlling interest  to december  paris re s technical results for the period from october  to december  are presented as a separate non life sub segment below 
in our discussion and analysis of comparative periods  we have quantified the contribution of additional revenue or expense and additional assets  liabilities and equity resulting from the acquisition wherever such amounts are material and identifiable 
as the company s reinsurance operations are exposed to low frequency high severity risk events  some of which are seasonal  results for certain years may include unusually low loss experience  while results for other years may include significant catastrophic losses 
for example  the company s results for included no significant catastrophic losses  while and included losses from large catastrophic events 
during the second half of  the world s financial markets experienced unprecedented events and severe dislocation  which led to the us government approving a billion package to provide increased liquidity to eligible financial institutions 
the concerns spread to europe and asia  as there was a recognition that the problems were not contained in the us  and other governments provided similar bail out packages to support their economies 
in  interest rates decreased  credit spreads widened  equity markets declined and the us dollar strengthened against most currencies 
beginning in the second quarter of  and continuing for the rest of the year  the financial markets showed improvement  primarily with partial recovery in worldwide equity and credit markets 
during  credit spreads narrowed and risk free rates increased 
the increases in risk free rates in were significantly lower than the decreases in risk free rates in the impacts of the global financial and economic crisis are wide ranging and have also affected the company s reinsurance operations 
accordingly  the company revised its loss estimates and has modestly increased its reserves in affected lines of business for certain underwriting years  where increased reported claims are anticipated  based on information provided by its cedants 
the company s loss reserves related to the impacted lines of business represent management s best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities related to these events based on information available at december  the company s financial position includes an increase in the fair value of its investment portfolio  primarily driven by the impact of the paris re acquisition and the narrowing credit spreads  which were partially offset by an increase in the risk free rates 
the company s results of operations in include the related increase in the level of unrealized gains on investments  which are recorded in net income  compared to the unrealized losses which were recorded in effective january   the company s available for sale securities were reclassified as trading securities and all subsequent changes in pre tax unrealized gains and losses are recorded in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to this date  unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  on available for sale securities were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
these events and the continuing uncertainty or volatility in the capital or credit markets are discussed below in review of net income  results by segment and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  and may continue to affect our results of operations and financial condition in the future

the company believes that in order to enhance the understanding of its profitability  it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of net income separately and in the aggregate 
underwriting result should not be considered a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business  which is also impacted by investment results and other items 
over the underwriting result for the non life segment increased by million  from million in to million in the increase was principally attributable to an increase of million  net of reinstatement premiums of million  related to the lack of large catastrophic losses in compared to  an increase of million in net favorable loss development on prior accident years  from million in to million in the components of the net favorable loss development are described in more detail in the discussion of individual sub segments in results by segment below  an increase of million resulting from the acquisition of paris re  and an increase of approximately million resulting primarily from a lower frequency of mid sized losses in and normal fluctuations in profitability between periods  partially offset by an increase of million in other operating expenses  partially due to the inclusion of paris re s non life operating expenses 
underwriting result for the life segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this improvement was driven by an increase in profitability of the mortality line  primarily the result of favorable development in the gmdb business due to improved capital market conditions  which have an impact on results in this line of business

table of contents the company reported net investment income of million in compared to million in the increase in net investment income is primarily attributable to the contribution from paris re s investments and funds held directly managed account  and increases in net investment income from fixed income maturities due to the reinvestment of cash flows from operations and the purchase of higher yielding investments 
partially offsetting these increases were the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations  which contributed a decrease as a result of stronger average us dollar foreign exchange rates in compared to  cash outflows from the investment portfolio related to the repayment of the company s debt and purchase of the company s cents in the first quarter of  and an increase in investment expenses 
net realized and unrealized investment gains improved by  million  from a loss of million in to a gain of million in the improvement in net realized and unrealized investment gains in was mainly due to the narrowing of credit spreads and increases in worldwide equity markets  partially offset by increases in risk free rates

the net foreign exchange losses in compared to were mainly due to higher foreign exchange losses related to foreign currency exchange hedges on the investment portfolio  which were partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses resulting from the impact of currency movements on unhedged securities 

table of contents income tax expense was million in compared to million in the increase in the income tax expense was primarily due to higher pre tax income  including tax on the net realized gain on purchase of cents of million 
the income tax expense of million in was primarily due to a non recurring tax charge of approximately million related to the company s european reorganization  and was partially offset by a tax benefit associated with the net realized and unrealized losses on investments 
over the underwriting result for the non life segment decreased by million  from million in to million in the decrease was principally attributable to an increase in large catastrophic losses of million  net of reinstatement premiums  relating to hurricane ike in compared to european windstorm kyrill in  a decrease of approximately million resulting primarily from higher loss estimates for the and underwriting years in certain lines of business reflecting deteriorating economic and credit conditions  and also a higher frequency of mid sized losses and normal fluctuations in profitability between periods generally  given the softening market conditions  and an increase of million in other operating expenses  partially offset by an increase of million in net favorable development on prior accident years  from million in to million in the components of the net favorable loss development are described in more detail in the discussion of individual sub segments in results by segment below 
underwriting result for the life segment decreased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in  primarily due to higher operating expenses of million and a decrease of million in the technical result 
the decrease of million in the technical result was driven by an increase in net adverse prior year reserve development of million reflecting charges in our gmdb line due to adverse capital market conditions 
this was partially offset by a change in the mix of business to the mortality line and normal fluctuations in profitability between periods 
see results by segment below for more details 
the company reported net investment income of million in compared to million in the increase in net investment income is primarily attributable to the increase in the asset base resulting from the investment of the company s significant cash flows from operations and from higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturity bonds  on average  during higher average foreign exchange rates also contributed of the increase as a result of the weakening of the us dollar  on average  in compared to net realized and unrealized investment losses increased by million  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the increase in net realized and unrealized investment losses in was mainly due to increases in credit spreads  declines in worldwide equity markets and defaults on certain corporate bonds  which were partially offset by decreases in us and european risk free interest rates

the unrealized investment losses reflect the company s adoption of fair value option  which was effective january  thus  the results of and are not comparable 
see net realized and unrealized investment gains losses below for more details on the net realized and unrealized loss activity 
interest in the results of equity investments increased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the loss recorded in the period was due to a million charge related to the company s investment in channelre holdings 
as this investment is fully written off  no similar charge was recorded in the period 
see the discussion in corporate and other below for more details 

table of contents the decrease in the technical result from income of million in to income of million in is primarily related to large catastrophic losses from hurricane ike of million  net of reinstatement premiums  in the insurance linked securities line in  which is partially offset by higher net premiums earned in compared to other income loss increased from a loss of million in to income of million in the period reflected write downs and mark to market adjustments on various transactions in the principal finance line 
see the discussion in corporate and other below for more details 
other operating expenses included in corporate and other increased by million from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs  including stock based compensation expense 
interest expense decreased by million  from million in to million in mainly due to lower interest expense on the company s million floating rate long term debt  partially offset by a make whole payment of million incurred in related to the early retirement of the company s million bank loan 
net foreign exchange gains were million in compared to losses of million in the net foreign exchange gains in were mainly a result of lower forward points paid  which reflect the interest rate differential between currencies bought and sold against the us dollar and euro  and changes in the company s net us dollar assets in its subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  partially offset by the impact of the currency movements on unhedged securities against the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries or branches 
income tax expense decreased by million  from million in to million in reflecting lower pre tax results 
the income tax expense of million in was primarily due to a non recurring tax charge of approximately million related to the company s european reorganization  and was partially offset by a tax benefit associated with the net realized and unrealized losses on investments and other tax benefits associated with foreign exchange revaluations 
results by segment the company monitors the performance of its operations in three segments  non life  life and corporate other 
the non life segment is further divided into five sub segments  us  global us p c  global non us specialty  catastrophe and paris re 
segments and sub segments represent markets that are reasonably homogeneous in terms of geography  client types  buying patterns  underlying risk patterns and approach to risk management 
see the description of the company s segments and sub segments as well as a discussion of how the company measures its segment results in note to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
segment results are shown net of intercompany transactions 
business reported in the global non us p c  global non us specialty and paris re sub segments and the life segment is  to a significant extent  denominated in foreign currencies and is reported in us dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for each year 
the us dollar has fluctuated against the euro and other currencies during each of the three years presented and this should be considered when making year to year comparisons 
non life segment us the technical result of the us sub segment has fluctuated in the last three years reflecting varying levels of large loss events  predominantly in the agriculture and property lines of business  increasing loss trends mainly in the casualty line of business and development on prior years reserves  which impacted year to year comparisons as discussed below 
the us casualty line represented approximately  and of net premiums written in this sub segment for  and  respectively 
this line typically tends to have a higher loss 
table of contents ratio and a lower technical result  due to the long tail nature of the risks involved 
casualty treaties typically provide for investment income on premiums invested over a longer period as losses are typically paid later than for other lines 
investment income  however  is not considered in the calculation of technical result 
the following table provides the components of the technical result and the corresponding ratios for this sub segment in millions of us dollars change over change over gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned losses and loss expenses acquisition costs technical result loss ratio acquisition ratio technical ratio technical result is defined as net premiums earned less losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs 
loss ratio is obtained by dividing losses and loss expenses by net premiums earned 
acquisition ratio is obtained by dividing acquisition costs by net premiums earned 
technical ratio is defined as the sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition ratio 
premiums the us sub segment represented of total net premiums written in  and  respectively 
over net premiums earned increased by  while gross and net premiums written remained nearly flat in compared to the slight decline in gross premiums written was driven by decreases in the casualty line of business  reflecting declining pricing and market conditions  and in the agriculture line  resulting from higher downward premium adjustments reported by cedants in compared to these decreases were partially offset by increases in gross premiums written in the motor and property lines  primarily driven by new business written  while the property line also benefited from a treaty written on december  and subsequently renewed in while gross premiums written declined slightly in compared to  net premiums written increased due to the purchase of a retrocessional cover in which was not renewed in the increase in net premiums earned was primarily due to the factors described above 
notwithstanding the increased competition prevailing in certain lines and markets of this sub segment and the increased risk retention by cedants  the company was able to write business that met its portfolio objectives 
over gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned increased by  and  respectively  in compared to the increase in gross and net premiums written resulted primarily from growth in the company s agriculture and property lines of business 
due to the increased opportunities in the agriculture line  the company recorded million in net premiums written  after the impact of million of retrocessional cover  compared to million in the growth in premiums written in the agriculture line of business increased the company s exposure to commodity price risk for crops  as well as drought and other agricultural risks 
separately  the company wrote a treaty on december  with premiums of million which were earned in the increase in gross and net premiums written in the agriculture and property lines was partially

outlook during the january  renewals  the company observed continued difficult market conditions with flat to slightly decreased pricing levels in most treaty markets 
certain markets in this sub segment displayed increased pressure on terms and conditions and increased retentions by ceding companies continued  but at a more moderate rate 
the company also noted a marginal shift from proportional business to excess of loss 
cedants continued to place high importance on the security and financial strength of reinsurers  which in turn helped maintain a competitive advantage for the company 
the agriculture business traditionally renews later in the first quarter and remains largely in process 
based on the overall pricing indications and renewal information received from cedants and brokers  and assuming similar conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue for the remainder of  management generally expects to maintain the current profitability levels for this sub segment

outlook during the january  renewals  the company observed overall moderate softening of terms and conditions and pricing with strengthening following loss experience in certain markets 
the company s expected premium volume increased at the january  renewals in this sub segment  primarily as a result of new opportunities in certain markets 
management expects a continuation of these trends and conditions for the remainder of paris re the paris re sub segment is primarily comprised of lines of business that are considered to be either short or medium tail 
the short tail lines consist of agriculture  catastrophe  energy  property  proportional motor and specialty property and represented of the net premiums written in in this sub segment

due to a retrocessional cover in place for the marine line of business  the net premiums written were mainly comprised of property  credit surety and motor business 
the property line of business benefited from premium adjustments reported by cedants during the period from october  to december  net premiums earned are higher than net premiums written primarily due to the earning of premiums in the period from october  to december  related to business written prior to october   predominantly in the catastrophe line of business  which represented and of net premiums written and net premiums earned  respectively

table of contents outlook during the january  renewals  the company observed some softening in market conditions combined with increased retentions by cedants in certain markets 
the acquisition of paris re by the company resulted in some business being lost and a limited number of new business opportunities 
as a result  the expected premium volume at constant foreign exchange rates reduced at the january  renewals in this sub segment 
management expects a continuation of these trends and conditions for the remainder of life segment the following table provides the components of the allocated underwriting result for this segment in millions of us dollars change over change over gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned life policy benefits acquisition costs technical result nm nm other income nm other operating expenses net investment income allocated underwriting result nm not meaningful allocated underwriting result is defined as net premiums earned  other income or loss and allocated net investment income less life policy benefits  acquisition costs and other operating expenses

over gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned increased by in compared to the increase in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned was primarily driven by new business in the mortality line and growth in the longevity line and was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and lower additional premiums reported in by a cedant for a longevity treaty in run off 
foreign exchange fluctuations decreased gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned by as a result of the stronger us dollar in compared to over gross premiums written decreased by  and net premiums written and earned increased by and in compared to  respectively 
the decrease in gross premiums written in compared to was primarily driven by the non renewal of a large longevity treaty  which was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and an additional million of premiums reported by a cedant for a longevity treaty in run off 
net premiums written increased despite the decrease in gross premiums written primarily because the company purchased additional reinsurance protection in the mortality line of business in compared to the weaker us dollar in and resulting foreign exchange fluctuations contributed an increase of to gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned 

table of contents life policy benefits over life policy benefits decreased by million in compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to an increase of million in net favorable prior year development and lower life policy benefits reported in by a cedant for a longevity treaty in run off 
the net favorable development of million in and the net adverse development of million in were mainly driven by the gmdb business  where the payout is linked to the performance of underlying capital market assets in france 
these decreases in life policy benefits were partially offset by new business in the mortality line and growth in longevity line as discussed above 
over life policy benefits increased by in compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in net adverse prior year reserve development of million and additional life policy benefits of million in reported by a cedant for a longevity treaty in run off  which were partially offset by a change in the mix of business as the mortality line  which generally carries a lower level of life policy benefits than the longevity line  increased its percentage of the life segment s net premiums earned 
the increase in net adverse prior year reserve development of million reflected adverse development of million in compared to million in the million of net adverse prior year reserve development in is comprised of million of adverse development from the gmdb business and was partially offset by favorable development from short term products 
the adverse development on the gmdb business was primarily due to benefit reserves being linked to the performance of underlying capital market assets in france and also due to the impact of increased credit spreads on index linked products that are interest rate sensitive 
acquisition costs over the decrease in acquisition costs in compared to was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations  downward profit commission adjustments reported by cedants and new business with lower costs ratios  partially offset by acquisition costs on higher premiums earned 
over the increase in acquisition costs in compared to was primarily attributable to higher rate of lapses than expected on tci products in the mortality line and profit commission adjustments  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in acquisition costs reported by a cedant for a longevity treaty in run off

over net investment income increased by million in compared to primarily as a result of higher invested assets from the growth in the book of business 
the comparative figure was also affected by a decrease of million due to the commutation of a financing treaty 

table of contents allocated underwriting result over the increase of million in allocated underwriting result in compared to was primarily explained by the increase in the technical result of million  and was partially offset by lower net investment income and higher operating expenses 
the increase in the technical result was driven by favorable development of million from the gmdb business in compared to adverse development of million in  and normal fluctuations in profitability between periods 
over the decrease in allocated underwriting result of million in compared to is primarily explained by an increase in operating expenses of million and a decrease in technical result of million  which were partially offset by an increase in allocated investment income of million 
the decrease in the technical result of million was driven by an increase of million in net adverse prior year reserve development  which was partially offset by a change in the mix of business to the mortality line  as discussed above 
outlook the life segment experiences only limited active renewals  as several contracts are written on a continuous basis 
the active renewal is mainly in the mortality line 
for those treaties that actively renewed  pricing conditions and terms were stable 
the mortality line also benefited from new opportunities where the company observed improved pricing and conditions 
management expects a slight increase in premiums written during  assuming constant foreign exchange rates 
premium distribution by line of business the distribution of net premiums written by line of business for the years ended december   and was as follows non life property and casualty casualty property motor multiline and other specialty agriculture aviation space catastrophe credit surety engineering energy marine specialty casualty specialty property life total 
table of contents there were modest shifts in the distribution of net premiums written by line in  and  which reflected the company s response to existing market conditions 
the distribution of net premiums written may also be affected by the timing of renewals of treaties  a shift in treaty structure and premium adjustments by cedants 
in addition  foreign exchange fluctuations affected the comparison for all lines 
casualty the decrease in net premiums written in and was primarily due to increasingly competitive market conditions and non renewals as pricing did not adequately reflect increasing loss trends 
agriculture the increase in net premiums written in compared to resulted primarily from the growth in the company s agriculture line of business in its us sub segment  which benefited from increased opportunities  pricing and demand 
outlook based on information received from cedants and brokers during the january  renewals and assuming that similar trends and conditions to those experienced during the january  renewals continue through the year  management expects increases in the relative distribution of catastrophe and credit surety premiums in and expects other lines to be comparable to premium distribution by treaty type the company typically writes business on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
on proportional business  the company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant 
on non proportional business  the company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio 
in both proportional and non proportional business  the company typically reinsures a large group of primary insurance contracts written by the ceding company 
in addition  the company writes business on a facultative basis 
facultative arrangements are generally specific to an individual risk and can be written on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
generally  the company has more influence over pricing  as well as terms and conditions  in non proportional and facultative arrangements 
the distribution of gross premiums written by treaty type for the years ended december   and was as follows non life segment proportional non proportional facultative life segment proportional non proportional total the distribution of gross premiums written by treaty type is affected by changes in the allocation of capacity among lines of business  the timing of receipt by the company of cedant accounts and premium adjustments by cedants 
in addition  foreign exchange fluctuations affected the comparison for all treaty types 
the decrease in the percentage of non proportional gross premiums written in the non life segment in compared to the resulted primarily from decreases in the casualty line of business in the us sub segment 
the increase in the percentage of proportional gross premiums written for the non life segment in compared to resulted primarily from the growth in the company s agriculture line of business in its us 
table of contents sub segment 
the decrease in the percentage of proportional gross premiums written for the life segment in compared to results primarily from the non renewal of a large longevity treaty in  which was written on a proportional basis 
outlook based on renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming that similar conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue throughout the year  management expects an increase in the relative distribution of facultative business following the acquisition of paris re and expects the relative distribution of gross premiums written by other treaty types in to be similar to premium distribution by geographic region the geographic distribution of gross premiums written for the years ended december   and was as follows north america europe latin america  caribbean and africa asia  australia and new zealand total the distribution of gross premiums written in europe was affected by foreign exchange fluctuations  as premiums denominated in currencies that have depreciated against the us dollar were converted into us dollars at lower average exchange rates 
the increase in gross premiums written in latin america  caribbean and africa and asia  australia and new zealand is primarily due to an increase in the property line in the global non us p c sub segment and the acquisition of paris re  which writes a proportionately higher percentage in these regions 
outlook based on renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming that similar conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue throughout the year and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  management expects the distribution of gross premiums written by geographic region in to be similar to premium distribution by production source the company generates its gross premiums written both through brokers and through direct relationships with cedants 
the percentage of gross premiums written by production source for the years ended december   and was as follows broker direct the distribution of gross premiums written by production source reflects an increase in gross premiums written through brokers in europe  and a modest shift in the mix of gross premiums written in other geographic locations 
outlook based on renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming that similar conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue throughout the year  management expects the production source of gross premiums written in to be similar to

management expects these favorable factors to be partially offset by lower reinvestment rates due to lower us and european interest rates 
net realized and unrealized investment gains losses the company s portfolio managers have dual investment objectives of optimizing current investment income and achieving capital appreciation

maturity distribution the distribution of fixed maturities and short term investments underlying the funds held directly managed account at december   by contractual maturity date  is shown below in millions of us dollars

table of contents rating distribution the following table provides a breakdown of the credit quality of fixed income securities underlying the company s funds held directly managed account at december  of total fixed income securities rating category aaa aa a bbb below investment grade unrated funds held by reinsured companies cedants in addition to the funds held directly managed account described above  the company writes certain business on a funds held basis 
the following discussion excludes the funds held directly managed account 
under such contractual arrangements  the cedant retains the net funds that would have otherwise been remitted to the company and credits the net fund balance with investment income 
as of december  and  the company recorded million and million  respectively  of funds held assets in its consolidated balance sheets 
the increase in funds held assets at december  compared to december  is primarily due to the acquisition of paris re and the impact of the weaker us dollar conversion of funds held assets on contracts that are denominated in currencies that have appreciated against the us dollar 
at december   the five largest cedants represented of the funds held balance  with overall net offsetting liabilities owed by the company to those cedants 
approximately of the funds held at december  earned investment income based upon a predetermined interest rate  either fixed contractually at the inception of the contract or based upon a recognized market index eg  libor 
interest rates at december  ranged from to 
under these contractual arrangements  there are no specific assets linked to the funds held assets  and the company is only exposed to the credit risk of the cedant 
these arrangements include three of the five cedants with the largest funds held assets  which represented of the company s funds held balance 
with respect to the remaining of funds held at december   the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the cedant  or the investment return earned by the cedant on its entire investment portfolio 
this portion of the company s funds held assets at december  included two of the five cedants with the largest funds held assets  representing of the company s total funds held assets 
the company does not legally own or directly control the investments underlying its funds held assets and only has recourse to the cedant for the receivable balances and no claim to the underlying securities that support the balances 
decisions as to purchases and sales of assets underlying the funds held balances are made by the cedant  in some circumstances  investment guidelines regarding the minimum credit quality of the underlying assets may be agreed upon between the cedant and the company as part of the reinsurance agreement  or the company may participate in an investment oversight committee regarding the investment of the net funds  but investment decisions are not otherwise influenced by the company 
within this portion of the funds held assets  the company has several annuity treaties which are structured so that the return on the funds held balances is tied to the performance of an underlying group of assets held by the cedant  including fluctuations in the market value of the underlying assets 
one such treaty is a retrocessional 
table of contents agreement under which the company receives more limited data than what is generally received under a direct reinsurance agreement 
in these arrangements  the objective of the reinsurance agreement is to provide for the covered longevity risk and to earn a net investment return on an underlying pool of assets greater than is contractually due to the annuity holders 
while the company is also exposed to the creditworthiness of the cedant  the risk of loss to the company is somewhat mitigated  as the company generally has the contractual ability to offset a shortfall in the funds held asset with amounts owed to the cedant 
the company also has non life treaties in which the investment performance of the net funds held asset corresponds to the interest income on the assets held by the cedant  however  the company is not directly exposed to the underlying credit risk of these investments  as they serve only as collateral for the company s receivables 
that is  the amount owed to the company is unaffected by changes in the market value of the investments underlying the funds held 
in those cases where the company is exposed to the credit or interest rate risk of an underlying pool of assets  the company recognizes as a realized gain or loss the value of the credit and or interest rate derivative embedded within the funds held asset balance 
in the case of the company s annuity contracts  there is also generally a resulting offsetting adjustment to deferred acquisition costs related to this business 
at december   the cumulative value of such embedded derivatives was determined to be a loss of approximately million  which is substantially offset by a comparable but opposite adjustment to deferred acquisition costs 
unpaid losses and loss expenses the company establishes loss reserves to cover the estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts that the company writes 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
the company believes that the recorded unpaid losses and loss expenses represent management s best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities based on information available at december  at december  and  the company recorded gross non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses of  million and  million  respectively  and net non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses of  million and  million  respectively 
the increase of  million in net non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses from december  to december  was primarily due to the acquisition of paris re s net non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses

the non life ratio of paid losses to net premiums earned was  and  and the non life ratio of paid losses to incurred losses was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the higher non life ratio of paid losses to incurred losses for the year ended december  compared to is primarily due to an increase in paid losses related to the annual settlement in of agricultural business written in within the company s us sub segment  as well as a lower level of net incurred losses for the year ended december  policy benefits for life and annuity contracts at december  and  the company recorded gross policy benefits for life and annuity contracts of  million and  million  respectively  and net policy benefits for life and annuity contracts of  million and  million  respectively

as part of its long term strategy  the company will continue to actively manage capital resources to support its operations throughout the reinsurance cycle and for the benefit of its shareholders  subject to the ability to maintain strong ratings from the major rating agencies and the unquestioned ability to pay claims as they arise 
generally  the company seeks to increase its capital when its current capital position is not sufficient to support the volume of attractive business opportunities available 
conversely  the company will seek to reduce its 
table of contents capital  through dividends or stock repurchases  when available business opportunities are insufficient to fully utilize the company s capital at adequate returns 
the company may also seek to reduce or restructure its capital through the repayment or purchase of debt obligations  or increase or restructure its capital through the issuance of debt  when opportunities arise 
management uses growth in diluted book value per share as a prime measure of the value the company is generating for its common shareholders  as management believes that growth in the company s diluted book value per share ultimately translates into growth in the company s stock price 
diluted book value per share is calculated using common shareholders equity shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred shares divided by the number of fully diluted common and common share equivalents outstanding assuming exercise of all stock based awards and other dilutive securities 
the company s diluted book value per share increased by to at december  from at december   primarily due to the increase in shareholders equity noted above  which was also impacted by an increase in the number of fully diluted common and common share equivalents outstanding following the company issuing million common shares related to the acquisition of paris re

cash outflows are in the form of claims payments  purchase of investments  operating expenses  income tax payments  intercompany payments as well as dividend payments to the holding company  and additionally  in the case of partnerre us holdings  interest payments on the senior notes and the cents 
partnerre us holdings and its subsidiaries have million in senior notes as well as million of cents outstanding at december  and will pay approximately million in aggregate interest payments in related to this debt 
historically  the operating subsidiaries of the company have generated sufficient cash flows to meet all of their obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of the business written by the company  the seasonality in the timing of payments by cedants  the irregular timing of loss payments  the impact of a change in interest rates and credit spreads on the investment income as well as seasonality in coupon payment dates for fixed income securities  cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly between periods 
the company expects that annual positive cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to cover claims payments through  absent a series of unusual catastrophic events 
in the unlikely event that paid losses accelerate beyond the ability to fund such payments from operating cash flows  the company would use its cash balances available  or liquidate a portion of its high quality and liquid investment portfolio 
as discussed under investments above  the company s investments and cash  excluding the funds held directly managed account  totaled billion at december   the main components of which were investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and cash and cash equivalents totaling billion 
the company and its subsidiaries have access to a revolving line of credit of up to million as part of the company s syndicated unsecured credit facility see credit facilities below 
as of december   there were no borrowings under this line of credit 

table of contents financial strength ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies on the company s capacity to meet its obligations 
in the event of a significant downgrade in ratings  the company s ability to write business and to access the capital markets could be impacted 
some of the company s reinsurance treaties contain special funding and termination clauses that would be triggered in the event the company or one of its subsidiaries is downgraded by one of the major rating agencies to levels specified in the treaties  or the company s capital is significantly reduced 
if such an event were to occur  the company would be required  in certain instances  to post collateral in the form of letters of credit and or trust accounts against existing outstanding losses  if any  related to the treaty 
in a limited number of instances  the subject treaties could be cancelled retroactively or commuted by the cedant see risk factors in item a of part i of this report for the company s financial strength ratings 
credit facilities in the normal course of its operations  the company enters into agreements with financial institutions to obtain unsecured and secured credit facilities 
as of december   the total amount of such credit facilities available to the company was  million 
these facilities are used primarily for the issuance of letters of credit  although a portion of these facilities may also be used for liquidity purposes 
under the terms of certain reinsurance agreements  irrevocable letters of credit were issued on an unsecured and secured basis in the amount of million and million  respectively  at december   in respect of reported loss and unearned premium reserves 
included in the total credit facilities available to the company at december  is a million five year syndicated  unsecured credit facility 
this unsecured credit facility enables the company to potentially increase its available credit from million to million 
the ability of the company to increase its available credit to million is subject to the agreement of the credit facility participants and  given the recent financial crisis and related credit environment  this may be limited 
the company and its subsidiaries have access to a revolving line of credit of up to million as part of the company s syndicated unsecured credit facility 
at december  and  there were no borrowings under this revolving line of credit 
additionally  the syndicated unsecured credit facility allows for an adjustment to the level of pricing should the company experience a change in its senior unsecured debt ratings 
the pricing grid provides the company greater flexibility and simultaneously provides participants under the facility some price protection 
as long as the company maintains a minimum senior unsecured debt rating of bbb by standard poor s and baa by moody s  the pricing on the facility will not change significantly 
some of the credit facilities contain customary default  cross payment and acceleration provisions and require that the company maintain certain covenants 
the company s breach of any of the covenants would result in an event of default  upon which the company may be required to repay any outstanding borrowings and replace or cash collateralize letters of credit issued under these facilities 
at december  and  the company was not in breach of any of the covenants and no conditions of default existed under its facilities 
in addition to the unsecured credit facilities available to the company  paris re maintains two committed secured letter of credit facilities with a total amount available of million 
the facilities are used for the issuance of letters of credit  which must be secured fully or partially with cash and or government bonds and or investment grade bonds 
these credit facilities have maturity dates of january   with respect to a million facility  and november   with respect to a million facility 
the agreements include 
table of contents default covenants  which could require paris re to fully secure the outstanding letters of credit to the extent that the facility is not already fully secured  and disallow the issuance of any new letters of credit 
at december   no conditions of default existed under these facilities 
at december   the outstanding letters of credit issued under these facilities was million 
off balance sheet arrangements in october  the company entered into a forward sale agreement under which it agreed to sell approximately million of its common shares to an affiliate of citigroup global markets inc  which affiliate is referred to as the forward counterparty 
under the forward sale agreement  the company would deliver common shares to the forward counterparty on one or more settlement dates chosen by the company prior to october under the terms of the unamended half of the forward sale agreement  in the company delivered million common shares to the forward counterparty for total proceeds of million 
on july   the company amended the existing forward sale agreement 
under the terms of the amendment  half the contract matured according to its original term beginning on september   while the remaining half is extended to april the extension with the forward counterparty allows the company to deliver  of the  common shares subject to the original contract to the forward counterparty at any time during the remaining term of the agreement  which will mature beginning on april  the future sale price of the company s common shares under the amended half of the forward sale agreement will vary depending upon the market price of its common shares over a trading day period surrounding the maturity of the forward sale agreement in april  subject to a minimum price per share of and a maximum price per share of at december  if the company elects to settle all or a portion of the forward sale agreement prior to its maturity  the company will deliver common shares to the forward counterparty and will initially receive the present value of the minimum price per share  and the remaining payment  if any  due to the company will be made at maturity of the agreement based on the excess of the market price of the company s common shares over the minimum price per share at maturity of the contract 
settlement of the forward sale agreement may be accelerated by the forward counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events  and the maximum and minimum purchase prices will be reduced or increased quarterly depending on the amount of the company s dividends 
currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk due to both its ownership of its irish  french and canadian subsidiaries and branches  whose functional currencies are the euro and the canadian dollar  and to underwriting reinsurance exposures  collecting premiums and paying claims and other operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar and holding certain net assets in such currencies 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposure is to the euro 
at december   the value of the us dollar weakened approximately against the canadian dollar  against the british pound  and against the euro compared to december  since a large proportion of the company s assets and liabilities are expressed in these currencies  there was an increase in the us dollar value of the assets and liabilities denominated in these currencies at december  the foreign exchange gain or loss resulting from the translation of the company s subsidiaries and branches financial statements expressed in euro or canadian dollar functional currency into us dollars is classified in the currency translation adjustment account  which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the currency translation adjustment account increased by 
table of contents million during the year ended december  compared to a decrease of million and an increase of million during the years ended december  and  respectively  due to both the company s net asset exposure to currencies other than the us dollar and the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the currency translation adjustment for the years ended december   and in millions of us dollars currency translation adjustment at beginning of year change in currency translation adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive income net realized and unrealized loss on designated net investment hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income currency translation adjustment at end of year from time to time  the company enters into net investment hedges 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts of euro million and canadian million to hedge a portion of its net investment exposure to euro and canadian dollar exchange fluctuations resulting from the translations of its irish  french and canadian subsidiaries and branches 
subsequently  in the fourth quarter of  the company neutralized its existing net investment hedge by entering into foreign exchange contracts in an equal and opposite direction to those originally entered into 
as a result  the company s net notional exposure and net fair value of its net investment hedge at december  is nil and a gain of million  respectively 
the net unrealized gain of million at december  is included in the table above

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview management believes that the company is principally exposed to five types of market related risk interest rate risk  credit spread risk  foreign currency risk  counterparty credit risk and equity price risk 
how these risks relate to the company  and the process used to manage them  is discussed below 
as discussed previously in this report  the company s investment philosophy distinguishes between assets that are generally matched against the estimated net reinsurance assets and liabilities liability funds and those assets that represent shareholder capital capital funds 
at december   liability funds including the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account represented or billion of the company s total invested assets including the investments underlying the funds held directly managed account and accrued interest 
liability funds are invested in a way that generally matches them to the corresponding liabilities in both duration and currency composition 
this practice seeks to protect the company against changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
although the focus of this discussion is to identify risk exposures that impact the market value of assets alone  it is important to recognize that the risks discussed herein are significantly mitigated to the extent that the company s investment strategy allows market forces to influence the economic valuation of assets and liabilities in a way that is generally offsetting 
at december   capital funds represented or billion of the company s total invested assets 
these assets represent shareholders capital and are invested in a diversified portfolio with the objective of maximizing investment return  subject to prudent risk constraints 
capital funds contain most of the asset classes typically viewed as offering a higher risk and higher return profile  such as preferred and common stocks  private equity and bond investments and convertible and high yield fixed income securities  in addition to investment grade securities 
at december   of the company s capital funds were invested in investment grade fixed income securities compared to at december   reflecting the company s current view of available returns for higher risk assets 
the company s investment philosophy is to reduce foreign currency risk on capital funds by investing primarily in us dollar denominated investments 
in considering the market risk of capital funds  it is important to recognize the benefits of portfolio diversification 
although these asset classes in isolation may introduce more risk into the portfolio  market forces have a tendency to influence each class in different ways and at different times 
consequently  the aggregate risk introduced by a portfolio of these assets should be less than might be estimated by summing the individual risks 
the company s investment strategy allows the use of derivative investments  subject to strict limitations 
the company also imposes a high standard for the credit quality of counterparties in all derivative transactions and aims to diversify its counterparty credit risk exposure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning derivatives 
the following comments address those areas where the company believes it has exposure to material market risk in its operations 
interest rate risk the company s fixed income portfolio and the fixed income securities in the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account are exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
the company manages interest rate risk on liability funds by constructing bond portfolios in which the economic impact of a general interest rate shift is comparable to the impact on the related liabilities 
this process involves matching the duration of the investment portfolio to the estimated duration of the liabilities 
for loss reserves and policy benefits related to non life and traditional life business  the estimated duration of the company s liabilities is based on projected claims payout patterns 
for policy benefits related to annuity business  the company estimates duration based on its 
table of contents commitment to annuitants 
the company believes that this matching process mitigates the overall interest rate risk on an economic basis 
the company manages the exposure to interest rate volatility on capital funds by choosing a duration profile that it believes will optimize the risk reward relationship 
while this matching of duration insulates the company from the economic impact of interest rate changes  changes in interest rates do impact the company s shareholders equity 
the company s liabilities are carried at their nominal value  and are not adjusted for changes in interest rates  with the exception of certain policy benefits for life and annuity contracts and deposit liabilities that are interest rate sensitive 
however  substantially all of the company s invested assets including the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account are carried at fair value  which reflects such changes 
as a result  an increase in interest rates will result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s investments including the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account and a corresponding decrease  net of applicable taxes  in the company s shareholders equity 
a decrease in interest rates would have the opposite effect 
at december   the company held approximately  million of its total invested assets including the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account in mortgage asset backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  the adverse impact of which is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
at december   the company estimates that the hypothetical case of an immediate basis points or basis points parallel shift in global bond curves would result in a change in fair value of investments exposed to interest rates and total invested assets including the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account and shareholders equity as follows in millions of us dollars basis points change basis points change december  basis points change basis points change fair value of investments exposed to interest rates including accrued interest fair value of funds held directly managed exposed to interest rate risk including accrued interest total invested assets including funds held directly managed exposed to interest rate risk and including accrued interest shareholders equity this change does not take into account any potential mitigating impact from the equity market  taxes or the corresponding change in the economic value of the company s reinsurance liabilities  which  as noted above  would substantially offset the economic impact on invested assets  although the offset would not be reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
as discussed above  the company strives to match the foreign currency exposure in its fixed income portfolio to its multicurrency liabilities 
the company believes that this matching process creates a diversification benefit 
consequently  the exact market value effect of a change in interest rates will depend on which countries experience interest rate changes and the foreign currency mix of the company s fixed income portfolio at the time of the interest rate changes 
see foreign currency risk 
at december   the company estimated that the hypothetical case of an immediate basis point adverse parallel shift in global bond curves would result in an approximate  or million  increase in the fair value of 
table of contents investments exposed to interest rates  or an approximate and increase of the total invested assets and shareholders equity  respectively 
the percentage impact of an immediate change in interest rates on the company s total invested assets and shareholders equity has not changed significantly at december  compared to december  the absolute impact of an immediate change in interest rates on the company s total invested assets and shareholders equity has increased from million at december  to million at december   reflecting the increase in the fair value of investments following the acquisition of paris re 
interest rate movements also affect the economic value of the company s outstanding debt obligations and preferred securities in the same way that they affect the company s fixed income investments  and this can result in a liability whose economic value is different from the value reported in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company believes that the economic fair value of its outstanding senior notes  cents and preferred securities at december  was as follows in millions of us dollars carrying value fair value debt related to senior notes debt related to capital efficient notes series c cumulative preferred shares series d cumulative preferred shares partnerre finance a llc  the issuer of the senior notes  does not meet consolidation requirements under us gaap 
accordingly  the company shows the related intercompany debt of million in its consolidated balance sheet at december  partnerre finance ii inc  the issuer of the cents  does not meet consolidation requirements under us gaap 
accordingly  the company shows the related intercompany debt of million in its consolidated balance sheet at december  the fair value of the cents was based on the aggregate principal amount outstanding from partnerre finance ii inc of million at december  the fair value of the debt related to senior notes and cents has been calculated using quoted market prices based on the aggregate principal amount outstanding of million from partnerre finance a and million from partnerre finance ii  respectively 
for the company s series c and series d cumulative preferred shares  fair value is based on quoted market prices  while carrying value is based on the liquidation value of the securities 
the fair value of the company s senior notes  series c and series d cumulative preferred shares increased at december  as a result of narrowing credit spreads 
the fair value of the cents decreased from million at december  to million at december  due to the repurchase of million of the principal amount outstanding in march see shareholders equity and capital resources management above  partially offset by the impact of narrowing credit spreads 
credit spread risk the company s fixed income portfolio and the fixed income securities in the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account are exposed to credit spread risk 
fluctuations in market credit spreads have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
the company manages credit spread risk by the selection of securities within its fixed income portfolio 
changes in credit spreads directly affect the market value of certain fixed income securities  but do not necessarily result in a change in the future expected cash flows associated with holding individual securities 
other factors  including liquidity  supply and demand  and changing risk preferences of investors  may affect market credit spreads without any change in the underlying credit quality of the security 

table of contents as with interest rates  changes in credit spreads impact the shareholders equity of the company as invested assets are carried at fair value  which includes changes in credit spreads 
as a result  an increase in credit spreads will result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s investments including the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account and a corresponding decrease  net of applicable taxes  in the company s shareholders equity 
a decrease in credit spreads would have the opposite effect 
at december   the company estimates that the hypothetical case of an immediate basis points or basis points parallel shift in global credit spreads would result in a change in fair value of investments exposed to such spreads and total invested assets including the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account and shareholders equity as follows in millions of us dollars basis points change basis points change december  basis points change basis points change fair value of investments exposed to interest rates including accrued interest fair value of funds held directly managed exposed to interest rate risk including accrued interest total invested assets including funds held directly managed exposed to interest rate risk and including accrued interest shareholders equity the impacts of changes in credit spreads for all parallel shifts in basis points are lower than the impacts of changes in interest rates  as the change in credit spreads does not impact government fixed income securities 
however  the change in credit spreads does assume that mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored entities are affected  even though these typically exhibit significantly lower spread volatility than corporate fixed income securities 
this change also excludes any impact from the equity market  taxes  and the change in the economic value of the company s reinsurance liabilities  which may offset the economic impact on invested assets  although the offset would not be reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the company estimated that the hypothetical case of an immediate basis point adverse change in credit spreads would result in an approximate  or million  increase in the fair value of investments exposed to interest rates  or an approximate and increase in the total invested assets and shareholders equity  respectively 
the percentage impact of an immediate change in credit spreads on the company s total invested assets and shareholders equity has not changed significantly at december  compared to december  the absolute impact of an immediate change in credit spreads on the company s total invested assets and shareholders equity has increased from million at december  to million at december   reflecting the increase in the fair value of investments following the acquisition of paris re 
foreign currency risk through its multinational reinsurance operations  the company conducts business in a variety of non us currencies  with the principal exposures being the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  swiss franc and singapore dollar 
as the company s reporting currency is the us dollar  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is generally able to match its liability funds against its net reinsurance liabilities both by currency and duration to protect the company against foreign exchange and interest rate risks 
however  a natural offset does not exist for all currencies 
for the non us dollar currencies for which the company deems the net asset or liability 
table of contents exposures to be material  the company employs a hedging strategy utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments  as appropriate  to ensure that its liability funds are matched by currency 
the company does not hedge currencies for which its asset or liability exposures are not material or where it is unable or impractical to do so 
in such cases  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk 
however  the company does not believe that the foreign currency risks corresponding to these unhedged positions are material 
for the company s capital funds  including its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and branches  the company does not typically employ hedging strategies 
however  due to recent foreign exchange volatility  the company did enter into euro and canadian dollar net investment hedges during see currency above 
the table below summarizes the company s gross and net exposure in its december  consolidated balance sheet to foreign currency as well as the associated foreign currency derivatives the company has put in place to manage this exposure in millions of us dollars euro gbp cad chf sgd other total total assets total liabilities total foreign currency exposure total derivative amount net foreign currency exposure as the us dollar is the company s reporting currency  there is no currency risk attached to the us dollar and it is excluded from this table 
the us dollar accounted for the difference between the company s total foreign currency exposure in this table and the invested assets and other net liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  the above numbers include the company s investment in partnerre europe  whose functional currency is the euro  and certain of its branches  whose functional currencies are the euro or canadian dollar 
the above numbers also include the company s investment in paris re france  whose functional currency is the euro  and its canadian branch  whose functional currency is the canadian dollar 
assuming all other variables remain constant and disregarding any tax effects  a change in the us dollar of or relative to the other currencies held by the company would result in a change in the company s net assets of million and million  respectively  inclusive of the effect of foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments 
at december   the company s net foreign currency exposure in its consolidated balance sheet  after the effect of derivatives  was million 
the  million increase in the company s net foreign currency exposure compared to december  is primarily related to increases in euro and canadian dollar exposure following the acquisition of paris re and lower net notional investment hedges at december  counterparty credit risk the company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
the company controls this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities it purchases 
at december   approximately of the company s fixed income portfolio including the funds held directly managed account was rated aaa or equivalent rating  was rated a or better and of the company s fixed income portfolio was rated below investment grade 
the company believes this high quality concentration reduces its exposure to credit risk on fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
at 
table of contents december   the company is not exposed to any significant credit concentration risk on its investments  excluding securities issued by the us and other aaa rated sovereign governments  with the single largest corporate issuer and the top corporate issuers accounting for and of the company s total corporate fixed income securities excluding the funds held directly managed account  respectively 
within the segregated investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account  the single largest corporate issuer and the top corporate issuers accounted for and of total corporate fixed income securities underlying the funds held directly managed account at december   respectively 
the company keeps cash and cash equivalents in several banks and may keep up to million  excluding custodial accounts  at any point in time in any one bank 
to a lesser extent  the company also has credit risk exposure as a party to foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative contracts 
to mitigate this risk  the company monitors its exposure by counterparty  aims to diversify its counterparty credit risk and ensures that counterparties to these contracts are high credit quality international banks or counterparties 
these contracts are generally of short duration approximately days and settle on a net basis  which means that the company is exposed to the movement of one currency against the other  as opposed to the notional amount of the contracts 
at december   the company s absolute notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts  including the net investment hedge  was  million  while the net value of those contracts was an unrealized gain of million 
the company is also exposed to credit risk in its underwriting operations  most notably in the credit surety line and as part of it principal finance activities 
loss experience in these lines of business is cyclical and is affected by the general economic environment 
the company provides its clients in these lines of business with protection against credit deterioration  defaults or other types of financial non performance of or by the underlying credits that are the subject of the protection provided and  accordingly  the company is exposed to the credit risk of those credits 
as with all of the company s business  these risks are subject to rigorous underwriting and pricing standards 
in addition  the company strives to mitigate the risks associated with these credit sensitive lines of business through the use of risk management techniques such as risk diversification  careful monitoring of risk aggregations and accumulations and  at times  through the use of retrocessional reinsurance protection and the purchase of credit default swaps and total return and interest rate swaps 
the company purchased protection related to its investment portfolio and credit surety line primarily in the form of credit default swaps with a notional value of million and an unrealized loss of million at december  the company is subject to the credit risk of its cedants in the event of their insolvency or their failure to honor the value of the funds held balances due to the company for any other reason 
however  the company s credit risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company generally has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to cedants for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 
funds held balances for which the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the cedant or the investment return earned by the cedant on its investment portfolio are exposed to an additional layer of credit risk 
the company is also exposed to some extent to the underlying financial market risk of the pool of assets  inasmuch as the underlying policies may have guaranteed minimum returns 
following the acquisition of paris re  the funds held balances due to the company have significantly increased and the balance due from one cedant  colis e re  has also significantly increased 
paris re and its subsidiaries entered into a quota share retrocession agreement to assume business written by colis e re see summary of certain agreements between axa sa  colis e re  and paris re in item of part i of this report 
the agreement provided that the premiums related to the transferred business were retained by colis e re and credited to a funds held account 
at december   the funds held directly managed account due from colis e re was billion  including billion in a segregated investment portfolio 
the assets underlying the funds held directly managed account are maintained in a segregated investment portfolio by colis e re and 
table of contents managed by paris re 
the company is subject to the credit risk of this cedant in the event of insolvency or colis e re s failure to honor the value of the funds held balances for any other reason 
however  the company s credit risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company generally has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to the cedant for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 
see risk factors in item of part i of this report for additional discussion of the company s exposure if colis e re  or its affiliates  breach or do not satisfy their obligations 
the company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to its business written through brokers if any of the company s brokers is unable to fulfill their contractual obligations with respect to payments to the company 
in addition  in some jurisdictions  if the broker fails to make payments to the insured under the company s policy  the company might remain liable to the insured for the deficiency 
see risk factors in item a of part i of this report for detailed information on two brokers that accounted for approximately of the company s gross premiums written for the year ended december  the company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to its reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses 
reinsurance balances receivable from the company s clients at december  were  million  including balances both currently due and accrued 
the company believes that credit risk related to these balances is mitigated by several factors  including but not limited to  credit checks performed as part of the underwriting process and monitoring of aged receivable balances 
in addition  as the vast majority of its reinsurance agreements permit the company the right to offset reinsurance balances receivable from clients against losses payable to them  the company believes that the credit risk in this area is substantially reduced 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance balances receivable was million at december  the company purchases retrocessional reinsurance and requires its reinsurers to have adequate financial strength 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 
the balance of reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses was million  which is net of the allowance provided for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables of million at december  following the acquisition of paris re  the company s reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses has increased and the concentration of those balances has changed 
at december   of the company s reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses were either due from reinsurers with an a or better rating from standard and poor s or from reinsurers with collateralized balances 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses above for details of the company s reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses categorized by the reinsurer s standard poor s rating 
other than the concentration related to colis e re discussed above  the concentrations of the company s counterparty credit risk exposures have not changed materially compared to december  
table of contents equity price risk the company invests a portion of its capital funds in marketable equity securities fair market value of million  excluding fixed income mutual funds of million at december  these equity investments are exposed to equity price risk  defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices 
the company believes that the effects of diversification and the relatively small size of its investments in equities relative to total invested assets mitigate its exposure to equity price risk 
the company estimates that its equity investment portfolio has a beta versus the s p index of approximately on average 
portfolio beta measures the response of a portfolio s performance relative to a market return  where a beta of would be an equivalent return to the index 
given the estimated beta for the company s equity portfolio  a and movement in the s p index would result in a change in the fair value of the company s equity portfolio  total invested assets and shareholders equity as follows decrease change decrease change december  increase change increase change equities excluding fixed income mutual funds total invested assets including funds held directly managed  but excluding accrued interest shareholders equity this change does not take into account any potential mitigating impact from the fixed income market or taxes 
at december   the company estimated that a decrease in the s p and msci eafe indexes would result in an approximate  or million  decrease in the fair value of the company s equity portfolio  or an approximate nil and decrease of the total invested assets and shareholders equity  respectively 
the percentage impact of a decrease in equity markets on the company s equity portfolio has not changed significantly at december  compared to december  the absolute impact of a decrease in equity markets on the company s equity portfolio  total invested assets and shareholders equity have increased to million at december  compared to million at december   as a result of the increase in the equity portfolio  excluding fixed income mutual funds  from million at december  to million at december
