item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k report  including the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of juniper networks  inc the company that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  would  could  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this report under the section entitled risk factors in item a of part i and elsewhere  and in other reports we file with the sec  specifically the most recent reports on form q 
while forward looking statements are based on reasonable expectations of our management at the time that they are made  you should not rely on them 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
in the course of operating our business  we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices  the collection of receivables  the manufacturing  and shipment of products  the fulfillment of orders  the purchase of supplies  and the building of inventory and spare parts  among other matters 
each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period 
in making these decisions  we consider various factors including contractual obligations  customer satisfaction  competition  internal and external financial targets and expectations  and financial planning objectives 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  pricing credits  warranty costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges  assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report  we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses 
these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item  our risk factors section included in item a of part i  and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in item of part ii of this report 
changes to previously announced fiscal fourth quarter and us gaap annual results subsequent to the january  announcement of our preliminary fourth quarter and full fiscal year results for  we recorded additional litigation settlement charges of million in our reported results 
on february   we entered into a proposed agreement in principle to the federal securities class action litigation pending against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors relating to our historical stock option granting practices 
this litigation settlement charge resulted in an increase in total operating expense and a reduction in operating income  income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest  provision for income taxes  consolidated net income  net income attributable to juniper networks  and net income per share attributable to juniper networks 
see further discussion in note  commitments and contingencies  under legal proceedings in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 

table of contents set forth below is a reconciliation of the january  announcement of our preliminary results press release to amounts reported in this annual report on form k which reflects the above mentioned adjustment in millions  except per share amounts three months ended december  year ended december  reported in reported in previously net annual report on previously net annual report on announced change form k announced change form k litigation settlement charges total operating expenses operating income income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest provision for income taxes consolidated net income net income attributable to juniper networks net income per share attributable to juniper networks basic diluted executive overview our performance for the fiscal year reflects the weakness in market demand for networking and security products  compared to the fiscal year  primarily due to our customers reaction to the weakened global economy 
the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the slowdown in the europe  middle east  and africa emea  and asia pacific apac service provider market 
while the global economy continues to challenge the marketplace  our portfolio selling strategy enabled us to expand our depth and breadth in the enterprise and service provider markets during the second half of as a result  the fourth quarter of was our strongest quarter in the enterprise market as well as in the service provider market in the us in addition  we were able to navigate through challenging economic conditions by controlling operating costs while continuing to invest in innovation and customer satisfaction 
the following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended december   and in millions  except per share amounts and percentages change change net revenues operating income percentage of net revenues net income attributable to juniper networks percentage of net revenues net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stock holders basic diluted 
table of contents net revenues our net revenues decreased in compared to  primarily due to reduced demand for our products particularly in the infrastructure segment  which is consistent with the overall decline in the global economy  partially offset by an increase in service revenue from both the infrastructure and slt segments 
net revenues from enterprise customers increased while net revenues from service providers decreased in  compared to net revenues decreased in all regions in compared to operating income our operating income as well as operating margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased in compared to these decreases were  in large part  due to the decrease in revenues and an increase in litigation settlement charges  partially offset by our efforts to control expenses and improve operational efficiencies in compared to net income attributable to juniper networks and net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stock holders the decrease in net income attributable to juniper networks net income and net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stock holders net income per share in compared to  is primarily due to a decrease in revenue  an increase in litigation settlement charges  and total non recurring income tax charges of million incurred during of the million  million related to the write off of certain net deferred tax assets resulting from a change in california income tax law  million related to a change in the tax treatment of stock based compensation expense in transfer pricing arrangements for certain us multinational companies due to a recent federal appellate court ruling and million related to an investigation by the india tax authorities 
other financial highlights total deferred revenue increased million in  primarily due to the growth in our installed equipment base for maintenance and customer support contracts and an increase in channel inventory 
in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program  at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million 
business and market environment we design  develop  and sell products and services that together provide our customers with high performance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single network 
we serve the high performance networking requirements of global service providers  enterprises  and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success 
high performance networking is designed to provide fast  reliable  and secure access to applications and services at scale 
we offer a high performance network infrastructure that includes ip routing  ethernet switching  security  and application acceleration solutions  as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments 
in  we continued to deliver new and innovative  high performance network infrastructure solutions 
we extended our junos software platform to include junos space network application platform and junos pulse integrated  multi service network client 
the launch of our next generation silicon  trio  enables d scaling and positions our mx series routers as a universal edge platform for the networking market 
we announced the tx matrix plus  a multi chassis system for the t core router  which in conjunction with the jcs control plane system brings virtualization to the core of the internet 
additionally  we announced a significant technological advance with gigabit ethernet interface cards for our t core router 
we also delivered our adaptive threat management solution  designed to help customers identify and respond to security incidents to help reduce overall risk 
we introduced a new solution for the intelligent services edge with the streamscope erm integrated video monitoring and analysis product  which is designed to enable customers to extend the capabilities of our m and mx series routers to enhance the quality of video services over cable  wireless  and internet protocol television networks 
our ethernet switching portfolio added the ex switch platform  the ex  a modular switching platform  and the ex  a high capacity modular switching platform designed for deployment in large enterprise data centers 
in addition  our next generation network infrastructure includes four new models of our srx family of dynamic services gateways 
we expanded our srx family of dynamic services gateways with the introduction of 
table of contents the srx  and extended the infrastructure for enterprises and started shipping the srx dynamic service gateway platforms 
our srx services gateways are sold into service provider and mobile packet core security markets as well as the enterprise market 
on the partnership front  we announced entry into oem agreements with dell to offer our networking solutions under dell s powerconnect brand  and with ibm to resell our ethernet networking products and support to ibm s data center customers 
in addition we entered in to a joint venture with nokia siemens networks bv nsn to develop and resell joint carrier ethernet solutions 
the recent weakness in the global economy has affected the purchasing behavior of our customers  particularly among service providers  and caused delays or reductions in purchase decisions  which led to lower revenues in compared to  as well as limited visibility regarding future business 
if economic growth in the us and other countries economies declines and or fails to recover  our customers may further delay or reduce their purchases  which could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies  and increased price competition 
we continue to plan to both invest in key r d projects that we believe will lead to future growth and remain focused on continuing our efforts to contain other costs and allocate resources effectively 
nature of expenses most of our manufacturing  repair  and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers 
accordingly  most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for standard product costs 
the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs  and standards that we establish 
our independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products primarily in china  malaysia  mexico  and the united states 
we have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers  manage our supply chain  and monitor product testing and quality 
as of december   and  we had and employees  respectively  in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers  manage our supply chain  and monitor and manage product testing and quality 
we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 
the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts  and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts  we may be  and have been in the past  liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 
in recent years  an increasing amount of our products has been manufactured in asia  and we anticipate that a larger percentage of our products will be produced outside the u 
s in the future 
our contracts generally provide for passage of title and risk of loss at the designated point of shipment to our customer 
the manufacturing of products in asia for shipment to customers in emea and the americas resulted in additional shipment logistics  freight  and timing issues for us as well as those customers 
in an ongoing effort to balance our and our customers needs  we have made changes on occasion to the payment of freight and the point of shipment with respect to products shipped from asia 
these changes affect shipping costs and the timing of revenue recognition of those shipments 
our operating expenses include r d  sales and marketing  and g a expenses 
r d expenses include costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products  costs for outside services such as certifications of new products  and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing 
several components of our r d effort require significant expenditures  such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment  the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses 
we expense our r d costs as they are incurred 
sales and marketing expenses include costs for selling and promoting our products and services  demonstration equipment  and advertisements 
these costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues  product launches  and marketing initiatives 
we have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales 
we have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during   and g a expenses include professional fees  bad debt provisions  and other corporate expenses 
professional fees include legal  audit  tax  accounting  and certain corporate strategic services 

table of contents employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our cost of service revenue and operating expenses  and we expect this trend to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  vacation  benefits  stock based compensation  and travel 
we had   and  employees as of december    and  respectively 
the year over year increases were primarily attributable to increases in our r d and customer service organizations 
our headcount is expected to increase in as we continue to expand these functions 
facility and information technology it departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount  respectively 
despite an increase in headcount in  these costs decreased due to our cost reduction initiatives 
facilities and it departmental costs increased in and  due to increases in headcount and new facility leases added to support our growth 
facility and it related headcount was   and as of december    and  respectively 
in  we expect to continue to invest in our company wide it infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives 
our cost of service revenues and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenues and operating expenses 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the appropriate line item of the consolidated statement of operations to which the hedged transaction relates 
any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
the decrease in cost of service revenues and operating expenses including r d  sales and marketing  as well as g a expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately in the increase in cost of service revenues and operating expenses including r d  sales and marketing  as well as g a expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately and in and  respectively 
other event listing on the new york stock exchange on october   we submitted an application to transfer the listing of our company s common stock to the nyse from nasdaq 
effective october   we transferred our listing from nasdaq to the nyse under the symbol jnpr 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience  and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 
revenue recognition 
our products are generally integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  software revenue recognition formerly  statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 

table of contents revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we generally rely upon sales contracts  or agreements and customer purchase orders  to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we use shipping terms and related documents or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery or performance 
in instances where we have outstanding obligations related to product delivery or the final acceptance of the product  revenue is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have been met 
sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectability is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by our credit checks and the customer s payment history 
we record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated customer returns  and pricing credits 
for arrangements with multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered items 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element  in which case  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period 
we account for multiple agreements with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual terms and or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are  in effect  parts of a single arrangement 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 
for sales to direct end users  value added resellers  and oem partners  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller or to an oem partner 
for our end users and value added resellers  there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
our agreements with our oem partners may allow future rights of returns or pricing credits 
a portion of our sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return 
we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors 
deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through 
deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as rebates and price protection  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
in addition  we report revenue net of sales taxes 
service revenues include revenue from maintenance  training  and professional services 
maintenance is offered under renewable contracts 
revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one to three years 
revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period  which is generally one year or less 

table of contents we sell certain interests in accounts receivable on a non recourse basis as part of a customer financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company 
we record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as short term debt 
contract manufacturer liabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair  and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts 
these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products  which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
we establish a provision for inventory  carrying costs  and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 
warranty costs 
we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  labor costs for customer support  and overhead at the time revenue is recognized 
material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period 
technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials  technical labor costs  and associated overhead incurred 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  we may incur additional warranty costs  which could reduce gross margin 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis  as well as when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i future declines in our operating results  ii a sustained decline in our market capitalization  iii significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry  or iv failure to meet our forecasted operating results 
we evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of november or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
under the income approach  we calculate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we performed impairment test for our goodwill as of november   and  and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment  or reporting units at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test 
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

table of contents we assess the recoverability of our intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances are greater than the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
if our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards including employee stock options  restricted stock units rsus  performance share awards  and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with fasb asc topic formerly  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
stock based compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures 
we utilize the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock based awards 
the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected option life  and risk free interest rate 
the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock  adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
the expected life of an award is based on historical experience  the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees  as well as the potential effect from options that have not been exercised at the time 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our recorded stock based compensation expense could be different 
income taxes 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in fasb asc topic income taxes fasb asc topic formerly  sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

to the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that future income from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon criteria set forth in fasb asc topic based upon these criteria  we estimate whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our 
table of contents determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  as occurred in connection with the california tax law change in the first quarter of  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
for further discussion of the california tax law change refer to note  income taxes  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under fasb asc topic and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves under fasb asc topic are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made as it was during the second quarter of  when we recorded a non recurring income tax charge as a result of a federal appellate court ruling in xilinx  inc v 
commissioner 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under fasb asc topic and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties  if applicable 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation  and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses

table of contents infrastructure product infrastructure product revenues decreased in compared to  primarily due to decreased revenue in m  t  and e series product families attributable to our customers reduced demand due to the global economic environment  partially offset by revenue growth from our ex series switching products and mx series products 
in  we experienced a decrease in product revenue from the service provider market and a increase in product revenue from the enterprise market compared to the same period in the decrease in the service provider market was primarily due to decreased capital spending in that market  and the increase in the enterprise market was primarily due to the growth in our ex series switching business and our continued focus on selling infrastructure products into the enterprise market  which resulted in growth of enterprise revenues in americas and apac 
geographically  infrastructure product revenue decreased in all three regions in infrastructure product revenues increased in compared to  primarily attributable to revenue growth from our m mx and t series product families  from sales to both the service provider and enterprise markets due to our customers increased demand for network infrastructure solutions 
to a lesser extent  our ex series products  which were introduced in the first quarter of  and our e series products also contributed to the revenue growth in in  we experienced a increase in product revenue from the service provider market and a increase in product revenue from the enterprise market compared to the same period in from a geographical perspective  in  we experienced revenue growth in all three regions  with particular strength in the americas region 
we track infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth 
most of our infrastructure product platforms are modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media 
the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port

based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next months 
we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period 
however  our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products  the mix of product sales  and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditures  and r d plans  repurchases of our common stock  incurrence and repayment of debt  litigation expenses  settlements  and judgments  or similar items related to resolution of tax audits  volume price discounts and customer rebates  the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products  or technologies  changes in our compensation policies  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  our competitors responses to our products  our relationships with suppliers  partners  and customers  possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories  expenses related to our future restructuring plans  if any  tax expense associated with stock based awards  issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years  the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans  and general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets  including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets  international conflicts  and related uncertainties 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
the value of our investments are subject to market price volatility 
in addition  as of december   over of our cash and marketable securities are held in non us domiciled countries 
our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december    and  related to the sales of our investments 
the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december   and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions valuation of securities given an valuation of securities given an interest fair value as of interest rate decrease of x bps december  rate increase of x bps bps bps bps bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes foreign government debt securities other total valuation of securities given an valuation of securities given an interest fair value as of interest rate decrease of x bps december  rate increase of x bps bps bps bps bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes other total these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts periodically  we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the 
table of contents fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of approximately two months 
our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars 
our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenue and operating expenses 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates 
we record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial during the years ended december    and  respectively  in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
the decrease in operating expenses including cost of service revenue  r d  sales and marketing  and g a expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately in in and  the increase in cost of service revenue  operating expenses including r d  sales and marketing  and g a  due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately and  respectively 
equity price risk our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 
we monitor our publicly traded equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of a public traded equity investment exceeds its fair value  and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary  we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value 
in  we realized an impairment charge of million on a publicly traded equity security due to a sustained decline  in excess of six months  in the fair value of the investment below its cost basis that we judged to be other than temporary 
there was no such charge in we do not purchase our publicly traded equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes 
they are classified as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was million and million as of december   and  respectively 
additionally  our non qualified deferred compensation nqdc plan may also hold publicly traded securities 
investments under the nqdc plan are considered trading securities and are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   and  the total investments under the nqdc plan was million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss 
our investments in privately held companies are carried at cost 
in and  we realized an impairment charge of million and million  respectively  on minority equity investments in privately held companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in note  fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
the aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was million and million as of december   and  respectively
