price  delivery time  engineering and service support  and engine efficiency relating to fuel consumption and emissions drive competition 
raw materials and components 
our engine products and services segment purchases multiple ferrous and non ferrous castings  forgings  plate stock and bar stock for fabrication and machining into engines 
in addition  we buy a considerable amount of precision machined engine components 
we believe that all of these raw materials and components are readily available from various suppliers 
research and development the goal of our research and development effort is to strengthen our product portfolios for traditional markets while simultaneously creating distinctive and breakthrough products 
we utilize a process to move product innovations from concept to commercialization  and to identify  analyze  develop and implement new product concepts and opportunities aimed at business growth 

table of contents we employ scientists  engineers and technicians throughout our operations to develop  design and test new and improved products 
we work closely with our customers to identify issues and develop technical solutions 
the majority of our research and development expenditures are directed toward the development of new sealing products for hostile environments  the development of truck and trailer fleet information systems and the development of bearing products and materials with increased load carrying capability and superior friction and wear characteristics 
prior to introduction  new products are subject to extensive testing at our various facilities and at beta test sites in conjunction with our customers 
backlog at december   we had a backlog of orders valued at million compared with million at december  approximately of the backlog  mainly at fairbanks morse engine  is expected to be filled beyond backlog represents orders on hand that we believe to be firm 
however  there is no certainty that the backlog orders will in fact result in actual sales at the times or in the amounts ordered 
in addition  for most of our business  backlog is not particularly predictive of future performance because of our short lead times and some seasonality 
quality assurance we believe that product quality is among the most important factors in developing and maintaining strong  long term relationships with our customers 
in order to meet the exacting requirements of our customers  we maintain stringent standards of quality control 
we routinely employ in process inspection by using testing equipment as a process aid during all stages of development  design and production to ensure product quality and reliability 
these include state of the art cad cam equipment  statistical process control systems  laser tracking devices  failure mode and effect analysis and coordinate measuring machines 
we are also able to extract numerical quality control data as a statistical measurement of the quality of the parts being manufactured from our cnc machinery 
in addition  we perform quality control tests on parts that we outsource 
as a result  we are able to significantly reduce the number of defective parts and therefore improve efficiency  quality and reliability 
as of december   of our manufacturing facilities were iso  qs and or ts certified with the remaining facilities working towards obtaining iso and or ts certification 
twelve of our facilities are iso certified 
oems are increasingly requiring these standards in lieu of individual certification procedures and as a condition of awarding business 
patents  trademarks and other intellectual property we maintain a number of patents and trademarks issued by the us and other countries relating to the name and design of our products and have granted licenses to some of these trademarks and patents 
we routinely evaluate the need to protect new and existing products through the patent and trademark systems in the us and other countries 
we also have proprietary information  consisting of know how and trade secrets relating to the design  manufacture and operation of our products and their use that is not patented 
we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent  patent right  trademark  trade secret or license 
in general  we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell 
however  we also license patented and other proprietary technology and processes from various companies and individuals in order to broaden our product offerings 
we are dependent on the ability of these third parties to diligently protect their intellectual property rights 
in several cases  the intellectual property licenses are integral to the manufacture of our products 
for example  fairbanks morse engine licenses technology from man diesel for the four stroke reciprocating engine 
a loss of these licenses or a failure on the part of the third party to protect its own intellectual property could reduce our revenues 

table of contents although these licenses are all long term and subject to renewal  it is possible that we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or that they could be terminated for a material breach 
if this were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
employees and labor relations we currently have approximately  employees worldwide in our continuing operations 
approximately  employees are located within the us and approximately  employees are located outside the us  primarily in europe  canada and mexico 
approximately of our us employees are members of trade unions covered by collective bargaining agreements 
union agreements relate  among other things  to wages  hours and conditions of employment 
the wages and benefits furnished are generally comparable to industry and area practices 
we have collective bargaining agreements in place at three of our us facilities 
the hourly employees who are unionized are covered by collective bargaining agreements with a number of labor unions and with varying contract termination dates ranging from november to february in addition  some of our employees located outside the us are subject to national collective bargaining agreements 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the risks stated elsewhere in this annual report  set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  will  could  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terms 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur 
risks related to our business certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in asbestos litigation 
the historical business operations of certain subsidiaries of our subsidiary  coltec industries inc coltec  principally garlock sealing technologies llc and the anchor packing company anchor  have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
those subsidiaries manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products  predominately gaskets and packing products  that contained encapsulated asbestos fibers 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
there is no remaining insurance coverage available to anchor and it has no assets 
our subsidiaries exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers are actively managed through another coltec subsidiary  garrison litigation management group  ltd 
several risks and uncertainties may result in potential liabilities to us in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
those risks and uncertainties include the following the potential for a large number of future asbestos claims that are not covered by insurance because insurance coverage is  or will be  depleted  
table of contents the uncertainty of the number and per claim value of pending and potential future asbestos claims  the results of litigation and the success of our litigation and settlement strategies  the potential for large adverse judgments against us not covered by insurance and any surety appeal bonds and related cash collateral required in connection with appeals  an increase in litigation costs  fees and expenses that are not covered by insurance  the financial viability of our subsidiaries insurance carriers and their reinsurance carriers  and our subsidiaries ability to collect on claims from them  the timing of claims  payments and insurance recoveries  and limitations imposed on the amount that may be recovered from insurance in any year  the unavailability of any insurance for claims alleging first exposure to asbestos after july   the potential for asbestos exposure to extend beyond specific coltec subsidiaries arising from corporate veil piercing efforts or other claims by asbestos plaintiffs  bankruptcies of other defendants  and the prospect for and impact of any federal legislation providing national asbestos litigation reform 
when settlement payments exceed insurance recoveries from our subsidiaries carriers  our subsidiaries are required to fund these obligations from available cash 
this could adversely affect our ability to use cash for other purposes  including growth of our business  and adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  our estimated liability for claims is highly uncertain and is based on subjective assumptions 
the actual liability could vary significantly from the estimate recorded in our financial statements 
because of the uncertainty as to the number and timing of potential future asbestos claims  as well as the amount that will have to be paid to settle or satisfy any such claims in the future including significant bonds required by certain states while we appeal adverse verdicts  and the finite amount of insurance available for future payments  future asbestos claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for a further discussion of our asbestos exposure  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies asbestos 
our business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and distressed market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the markets in which we sell our products  particularly chemical companies  petroleum refineries  heavy duty trucking  semiconductor manufacturing  capital equipment and the automotive industry  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and 
table of contents subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales  gross margins and net income 
the current downward cycle has impacted our results of operations for our most recent quarterly periods 
the current economic environment may affect our opportunities for organic growth and a continued downward cycle could adversely affect our operating results 
moreover  a prolonged downward cycle may critically impair the continued viability of certain of our customers and may adversely impact our accounts receivable with these customers 
a prolonged and severe downward cycle in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our business 
customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce inventories 
to remain competitive  we need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we also need to develop new products to continue to meet the needs and desires of our customers 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position 
additionally  some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
certain of our products may also experience transformation from unique branded products to undifferentiated price sensitive products 
this products commoditization may be accelerated by low cost foreign competition 
initiatives designed to distinguish our products through superior service  continuous improvement  innovation  customer relationships  technology  new product acquisitions  bundling with key services  long term contracts or market focus may not be effective 
pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products  we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
our marketing success in the us and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents and distributors sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets 
many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products 
a loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors  or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships  could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
increased costs for raw materials or the termination of existing supply agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the prices for some of the raw materials we purchase increased in while we have been successful in passing along a portion of these higher costs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue doing so without losing customers 
similarly  the loss of a key supplier or the unavailability of a key raw material could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to discontinued operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in any fiscal period 
we have some contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations of our predecessors  including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters 
in some 
table of contents instances we have indemnified others against those liabilities  and in other instances we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities 
claims could arise relating to products or other matters related to our discontinued operations 
some of these claims could seek substantial monetary damages 
specifically  we may potentially be subject to the liabilities related to the firearms manufactured prior to by colt firearms  a former operation of coltec  and for electrical transformers manufactured prior to by central moloney  another former coltec operation 
coltec also has ongoing obligations with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters associated with discontinued operations that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of those operations 
we have insurance  reserves and funds held in trust to address these liabilities 
however  if our insurance coverage is depleted  our reserves are not adequate or the funds held in trust are insufficient  environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the us  which subjects us to additional business risks that may cause our profitability to decline 
because we sell our products in a number of foreign countries  we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales of our products outside of the us our international operations are  and will continue to be  subject to a number of risks  including unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse changes in foreign tax  legal and regulatory requirements  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing labor regulations  political and economic instability  and acts of hostility  terror or war 
any of these factors  individually or together  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities  which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations 
as we expand our international operations  we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local agents  distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to increase sales in these regions 
efforts to achieve growth through acquisitions  both domestic and international  involve numerous inherent challenges  such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities  successfully integrating new businesses or product lines  retaining key employees  properly evaluating risks and other 
table of contents diligence matters  ensuring adequate capital availability and balancing other resource constraints 
acquisitions may not succeed as planned 
failure to properly manage these risks could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks  including rising healthcare costs  changes in environmental laws and unforeseen business interruptions 
our business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks 
for example  medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase 
initiatives to address these costs  such as consumer driven health plan packages  may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed 
failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees 
other risks to our business include potential changes in environmental rules or regulations  which could negatively impact our manufacturing processes 
use of certain chemicals and other substances could become restricted or such changes may otherwise require us to incur additional costs which could reduce our profitability and impair our ability to offer competitively priced products 
additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations 
terrorist attacks  natural disasters  political insurgencies  pandemics and electrical grid failures are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
we believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know how  our business and prospects could be negatively impacted 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents  trademarks  service marks  domain names  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality  non compete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights 
patents issued to third parties  whether before or after the issue date of our patents  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
questions as to whether our competitors products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors intellectual property rights may be disputed 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable  limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions 
our competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology 
without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for our intellectual property  our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired  which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue 
as a result  we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
a relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers  competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance  as well as industry conditions and general financial  economic and political instability 
in particular  reports concerning asbestos litigation or asbestos reform could cause a significant increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock 

table of contents because our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods  our stock price may fluctuate 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs 
small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall 
we may also incur charges to income to cover increases in the estimate of our subsidiaries future asbestos liability 
other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include  but are not limited to demand for our products  the timing and execution of customer contracts  the timing of sales of our products  payments related to asbestos litigation or annual costs related to asbestos litigation that are not covered by insurance  the timing of receipt of insurance proceeds  increases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in applicable tax rates  unanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products  announcements by competitors of new products  services or technological innovations  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  raw materials or supplies  product development or administration  major changes in the level of economic activity in north america  europe  asia and other major regions in which we do business  costs related to possible future acquisitions or divestitures of technologies or businesses  an increase in the number or magnitude of product liability claims  our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  particularly outside the united states  and economic assumptions and market factors used to determine post retirement benefits and pension liabilities 

table of contents various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control 
the anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  our shareholder rights plan and provisions of north carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
in particular  our articles of incorporation and bylaws  among other things  will require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders meetings  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
our shareholder rights plan will also make an acquisition of a controlling interest in enpro in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of our convertible debentures 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital 
in addition  a reasonable number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans  including shares to be issued upon the exercise of stock options  vesting of restricted stock or unit grants  and upon conversion of our convertible debentures 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect  if any  that they may have on the market price for our common stock 
the issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur  could adversely affect the trading price of the debentures and the market price of our common stock 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
moreover  our current senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock if availability under the facility falls below million 
as a result  our common stock may be less attractive to certain investors than the stock of companies with a history of paying regular dividends 
risks related to our capital structure our debt agreement imposes limitations on our operations  which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investments and or pursue business opportunities 
we have a million senior secured revolving credit facility that imposes limitations on our operations  such as limitations on distributions  limitations on incurrence and repayment of indebtedness  and maintenance of a fixed charge coverage financial ratio 
these limitations could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investment needs and or pursue business opportunities 

table of contents we may not have sufficient cash to repurchase our convertible debentures at the option of the holder or upon a change of control or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion 
upon a change of control  subject to certain conditions  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all outstanding convertible debentures at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including liquidated damages  if any  up to but not including the date of repurchase 
upon a conversion  we will be required to make a cash payment of up to  for each  in principal amount of debentures converted 
however  we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of tendered debentures or settlement of converted debentures 
any credit facility in place at the time of a repurchase or conversion of the debentures may also limit our ability to use borrowings to pay any cash payable on a repurchase or conversion of the debentures and may prohibit us from making any cash payments on the repurchase or conversion of the debentures if a default or event of default has occurred under that facility without the consent of the lenders under that credit facility 
our current million senior secured credit facility prohibits distributions from our subsidiaries to us to make payments of interest on the debentures if a default or event of default exists under the facility 
our senior secured credit facility also prohibits prepayments of the debentures or distributions from our subsidiaries to us to make principal payments or payments upon conversion of the debentures if a default or event of default exists under the facility or the amount of the borrowing base under the facility  less the amount of outstanding borrowings under the facility and letters of credit and reserves  is less than million 
our failure to repurchase tendered debentures at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on a conversion of the debentures would constitute a default under the indenture 
a default under the indenture or the change of control itself could lead to a default under the other existing and future agreements governing our indebtedness 
if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the debentures or make cash payments upon conversion thereof 
risks related to the recent global financial crisis the volatility and disruption of global credit markets and adverse changes arising from the current global financial crisis may negatively impact our ability to access financing and expose us to unexpected risks 
the current global financial and credit crisis exposes us to a variety of risks 
we have historically funded our business with cash from operations and the proceeds from the issuance of our convertible debentures 
we have a million senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders as a backstop to our liquidity needs and there have been no borrowings under this facility to date 
in light of the unprecedented disruption of global credit markets and the instability of financial institutions that until recently were of unquestioned strength  there is a risk that a borrowing request properly made under the credit facility would not be honored by one or more of our lenders 
under the terms of the credit facility  no lender is obligated to fund a portion of a borrowing request that is not funded by another lender 
accordingly  in such an instance actual borrowings under our credit facility may be insufficient to support our liquidity needs and we would be required to seek alternate sources of liquidity 
in light of the recent capital and credit market disruption and volatility  we cannot assure you that such alternate funding will be available to us on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or at all 
as of the date of this filing we have no reason to believe that a borrowing request  properly submitted by us  would not be honored by any of our lenders  all of whom have assured us of their continuing ability to fund our facility

overview and outlook overview 
enpro was incorporated under the laws of the state of north carolina on january  we design  develop  manufacture and market proprietary engineered industrial products 
we have primary manufacturing facilities located in the united states and countries outside the united states 
we manage our business as three segments a sealing products segment  an engineered products segment  and an engine products and services segment 
our sealing products segment designs  manufactures and sells sealing products  including metallic  non metallic and composite material gaskets  rotary seals  compression packing  resilient metal seals  elastomeric seals  hydraulic components and expansion joints  as well as wheel end component systems  ptfe products  conveyor belting and sheeted rubber products

our engineered products segment includes operations that design  manufacture and sell self lubricating  non rolling  metal polymer  solid polymer and filament wound bearing products  aluminum blocks for hydraulic applications and compressor components 
these products are used in a wide range of applications  including the automotive  pharmaceutical  pulp and paper  natural gas  health  pump and compressor construction  power generation  machine tools  air treatment  refining  petrochemical and general industrial markets 
our engine products and services segment designs  manufactures  sells and services heavy duty  medium speed diesel  natural gas and dual fuel reciprocating engines 
the united states government and the general markets for marine propulsion  power generation  and pump and compressor applications use these products and services 
the company s quincy compressor business designed  manufactured and sold rotary and reciprocating air compressors  vacuum pumps and air systems used in the automotive  pharmaceutical  natural gas  health  air treatment and general industrial markets 
in december  we signed a definitive agreement to sell the quincy compressor business to the atlas copco group for approximately million in cash 
the transaction closed in the first quarter of accordingly  the quincy compressor business is presented as a discontinued operation in this form k 
additional information regarding the sale of the quincy compressor business is included in item b and note in january  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of sinflex sealing technologies  a distributor and manufacturer of industrial sealing products  located in shanghai  china 
the operation conducts business as garlock sealing technologies shanghai co 
ltd 
and is operated and managed as part of the global garlock sealing technologies business unit in the sealing products segment 
sinflex was garlock s principal distributor in china for over a decade 
in february  we acquired the stock of vw kaiser engineering  a manufacturer of pins  bushings and suspension kits primarily for the heavy duty truck and bus aftermarket 
vw kaiser 
table of contents engineering is located in michigan 
it is operated and managed as part of the stemco business unit  which is in the sealing products segment 
in june  we purchased the ownership of the minority shareholder of garlock pty limited in australia 
subsequent to the share purchase  we own of garlock pty limited  which is in the sealing products segment 
in october and november  we acquired certain assets of and assumed certain liabilities of three businesses which provide components and aftermarket services for reciprocating compressors to customers in the petroleum  natural gas  pet bottle molding and chemical processing industries 
the acquired businesses are horizon compressor services  inc  located in houston  texas  ram air  inc  located in new smyrna beach  florida  and c p services northern limited  located in warrington  uk 
the businesses are operated and managed as part of the cpi business unit in the engineered products segment 
in december  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of northern gaskets and mouldings limited ngm  a distributor of sealing products and a manufacturer of gaskets  located in batley  uk 
ngm operates as part of garlock great britain limited in the sealing products segment 
ngm increases garlock s presence in the petrochemical  pharmaceutical and oil and gas industries in the uk 
in february  we purchased ptm uk limited  a privately owned manufacturer and distributor of sealing products with two locations in the united kingdom 
the acquisition of ptm continued the expansion of garlock s presence in the uk  increasing the scale of the uk sealing products business and the ability to address new market segments 
ptm is included in our sealing products segment 
in august and september  we purchased usa parts service  llc  a privately owned parts supplier for natural gas compressors located in gillette  wyoming  and player cornish pet limited  a privately owned manufacturer of aftermarket components for compressors based in the united kingdom 
these businesses are managed as part of the cpi division in the engineered products segment 
in december  we purchased technetics corporation  a leading manufacturer of abradable seals  brush seals and acoustic products for turbines used in aerospace and power generation applications located in deland  florida 
the acquisition of technetics provides garlock with a unique line of metal sealing products that is expected to accelerate expansion in aerospace markets and broaden the line of products offered for land based turbines 
technetics is included in our sealing products segment 
during the first quarter of  we concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed which required us to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units  including ggb in the engineered products segment and at plastomer technologies in the sealing products segment  both of which had experienced reduced volumes as a result of deterioration in the global economic environment 
we performed a preliminary analysis and determined that it was necessary to conduct an impairment test for ggb and plastomer 
during the second quarter of  we conducted a thorough analysis to compare the fair value of ggb and plastomer technologies to the respective carrying values assigned to their net assets 
the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of its goodwill 
to estimate the fair value  we used both discounted cash flow and market valuation approaches 
the discounted cash flow approach uses cash flow projections to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit  the market approach relies on market multiples of similar companies 
the key assumptions used for the discounted cash flow approach include business 
table of contents projections  growth rates  and discount rates 
the discount rate we used was based on enpro s weighted average cost of capital 
for the market approach  we chose a group of companies that we believed to be representative of our diversified industrial and automotive peers 
based on the results of the test  we determined that the fair values of ggb and plastomer were less than the carrying values of their net assets  resulting in an implied fair value of goodwill of zero for both ggb and plastomer 
as a result  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million  which represented all of the remaining goodwill in these reporting units  in the second quarter of during the analysis  we also tested the fair value of all our other reporting units and determined that there was no goodwill impairment for any of the other reporting units 
we completed our required annual impairment test of goodwill for all of our reporting units as of october  and the results did not indicate any impairment of the remaining goodwill 
based on the results of the test  we determined that the fair value of one of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value by approximately and the other reporting units having goodwill balances had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by over 
on march   pursuant to a million share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors  we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with a financial institution to provide for the immediate retirement of million of our common stock 
under the asr agreement  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock from a financial institution at an initial price of per share 
total consideration paid at initial settlement to repurchase these shares  including commissions and other fees  was approximately million and was recorded in shareholders equity as a reduction of common stock and additional paid in capital 
the price adjustment period under the asr terminated on august  in connection with the finalization of the asr  we remitted in cash a final settlement adjustment of million to the financial institution that executed the asr 
the final settlement adjustment  recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital  was based on the average of the reported daily volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the asr 
it resulted in a remittance to the financial institution because the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the asr exceeded the initial price of per share 
after the final settlement adjustment  we had completed about million of the share repurchase authorization 
pursuant to the share repurchase authorization and in accordance with the terms of a plan to repurchase shares announced on september   we acquired  shares of our common stock in open market transactions at an average price of about per share  resulting in total repurchases of approximately million  including commissions and fees  from october  to october  on october   in light of the volatility in the financial and credit markets  the board of directors terminated the share repurchase plan 
as described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we actively manage the asbestos claims against our subsidiaries and the remaining insurance assets available for the payment of these claims 
we accrue an estimated liability for both pending and future asbestos claims for the next ten years 
for additional information on this subject discussed in this section  see contingencies asbestos 
outlook in the near term  the pace of recovery in our markets is uncertain  but we believe modest growth is likely during the first half of the year 
an increase in volume and the advantages of the cost reduction and efficiency programs we implemented last year should benefit our performance during that period and improve our results compared to the first half of the short cycles of most of our businesses make the second half of the year more difficult to foresee  but we believe that we have positioned our 
table of contents operations to capture new opportunities as they arise throughout the year 
our balance sheet remains strong and the resources available for investments in our operations will be increased by the proceeds from the sale of quincy compressor 
with stable markets  a lean enterprise and a solid financial base  we look forward to resuming and accelerating our growth in subject to a return to historical levels of profitability  and mix of domestic and foreign earnings  we expect that our effective tax rate in and beyond will be less volatile than it was in as a result of structural and organizational changes we have made in our european operations  we anticipate that our effective tax rate should generally be lower than historical rates 
we anticipate that cash flows in should benefit from improved operating income and the sale of quincy compressor  partially offset by higher capital expenditures  working capital and pension contributions 
despite significant improvement in the equity and fixed income investment markets in  our us defined benefit plans continue to be underfunded due to an increase in the value of plan liabilities 
based on currently available data  which is subject to change  we estimate that we will be required to make cash contributions in totaling million 
we estimate that the annual us pension expense in will be flat versus in connection with our business strategy to accelerate growth  we will continue to evaluate acquisitions and divestitures in  however  the impact of such acquisitions and divestitures cannot be predicted and therefore is not reflected in this outlook 
we address our outlook on asbestos claims and their impact in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the asbestos subsection of the contingencies section

the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those for enpro 
compared to sales of million in decreased from million in the decline in sales was the result of weak volumes in the sealing products and engineered products segments 
the drop in volumes resulted from slow industrial markets  reduced oem truck and trailer volumes  and lower automotive volumes 
fairbanks morse engine experienced higher sales of engine aftermarket parts and services in compared to the decrease in the values of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar accounted for three percentage points of the decline in sales 
segment profit  management s primary measure of how our operations perform  decreased from million in to million in segment profit decreased primarily due to lower volumes and lower absorption of manufacturing costs due to reduced production levels 
these decreases were partially offset by cost improvements resulting from actions taken in response to market weakness and selected price increases 
segment margins  defined as segment profit divided by sales  declined from in to in the weaker results at most businesses  particularly ggb and plastomer  were the primary cause for the decrease in segment margins  offsetting margin improvement at fairbanks morse engine

sales of million in were lower than the million reported in unit volume declines caused most of the reduction and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar accounted for three percentage points of the reduction 
sales at garlock sealing technologies decreased as a result of reduced demand in all geographic markets  weakness in the steel  oil and gas sectors  and weaker foreign currencies partially offset by selected price increases 
stemco s sales decreased primarily as a result of the lower volumes  partially offset by selected price increases and a favorable mix of aftermarket versus oem volumes 
its oem sales for the us heavy duty truck market in were significantly lower compared to as the number of new trailers built and usage of existing trucks decreased as a result of the us economic slowdown

operating margins for the segment increased to in from in compared to sales of million in increased from million in the results of acquisitions added six percentage points of the sales increase 
the increase in the values of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar contributed three percentage points to the increase

the decrease in insurance collections was partially offset by a decrease in asbestos related payments  which amounted to million in and million in we made a million contribution to the us defined benefit pension plans in but no contribution in we used million  million and million in investing activities in  and  respectively 
the increased cash used in investing activities in versus was primarily attributable to increased net payments for acquisitions and reduced proceeds from sales of assets and liquidation of investments  largely offset by reduced capital investments 
we made net payments for acquisitions of million in compared to million in capital expenditures in were million less than in as most businesses reduced spending in response to less favorable market conditions 
the decreased cash used in investing activities in versus was primarily attributable to a reduction in net payments for acquisitions from million in to million in  and a reclassification of million of unrestricted cash balances to other current and noncurrent assets in these were partially offset by a million increase in proceeds from sales of assets and liquidation of investments in versus in  we retired million in industrial revenue bonds and other debt 
in  we paid million in connection with the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock under a share repurchase program 
these transactions were reflected as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
capital resources our primary us operating subsidiaries have a senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of banks  which matures on april  we have not borrowed against this facility but do have million of letters of credit outstanding 
the facility is collateralized by our receivables  inventories  intellectual property  insurance receivables and all other personal property assets other than fixed assets of our us subsidiaries  and by pledges of of the capital stock of our direct foreign subsidiaries and of the capital stock of our direct and indirect us subsidiaries 
the facility contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for an asset based loan  including limitations on dividends  limitations on incurrence of indebtedness and maintenance of a fixed charge coverage financial ratio 
most of the covenants and restrictions apply only if availability under the facility falls below certain levels 
the maximum initial amount available for borrowings under the facility is million 
under certain conditions  we may request that the facility be increased by up to million  to million in 
table of contents total 
actual borrowing availability at any date is determined by reference to a borrowing base of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and is reduced by usage of the facility  which includes outstanding letters of credit  and any reserves 
the actual borrowing availability at december  under our senior secured revolving credit facility was million after giving consideration to letters of credit outstanding 
we issued million of convertible debentures in the debentures bear interest at an annual rate of  and we pay accrued interest on april and october of each year 
the debentures will mature on october  the debentures are direct  unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in priority with our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness 
they would effectively rank junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the debentures do not contain any financial covenants 
holders may convert the debentures into cash and shares of our common stock  if any  at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of debentures which is equal to an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment  before the close of business on october  upon conversion  we would deliver i cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted or our total conversion obligation  and ii shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
conversion is permitted only under certain circumstances that had not occurred at december  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures to enter into call options hedge and warrant transactions  which entitle us to purchase shares of our stock from a financial institution at per share and entitle the financial institution to purchase shares of our stock from us at per share 
this will reduce potential dilution to our common stockholders from conversion of the debentures and have the effect to us of increasing the conversion price of the debentures to per share 
we received approximately million in cash from the sale of quincy on march  and expect to receive an additional million in cash on or before december  upon the closing of the sale of quincy s subsidiary in china 
net of taxes  the proceeds from the sale of quincy should total approximately million 
additional information regarding the sale of the quincy compressor business is included in item b and note dividends to date  we have not paid dividends and we do not intend to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future 
if availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility falls below million  we would be limited in our ability to pay dividends 
as of december   we exceeded this minimum threshold 
the indenture that governs the convertible debentures does not restrict us from paying dividends 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities 
note  overview and significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical 
some of them involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time title and risk of ownership is transferred or when services are rendered 
any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue and expensed in cost of goods sold 
asbestos we accrue for known and estimated future asbestos claims for the next ten years and we record legal fees and expenses only when incurred 
the significant assumptions underlying the material components of the estimated liability include the number and trend of claims asserted  the mix of alleged diseases or impairment  the trend in the number of claims for malignant cases  primarily mesothelioma  the probability that some existing and potential future claims will eventually be dismissed without payment  the estimated amount to be paid per claim  and the timing and impact of large amounts available for the payment of claims from the g trusts of former defendants in bankruptcy 
the actual number of future actions filed per year and the payments necessary to resolve those claims could exceed those reflected in our estimate of the liability 
with the assistance of bates white  we periodically review the period over which we can make a reasonable estimate  the assumptions underlying our estimate  the range of reasonably possible potential liabilities and management s estimate of the liability  and adjust the estimate if necessary 
changing circumstances and new data that may become available could cause a change in the estimated liability in the future by an amount that cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and that increase could be significant and material 
additional discussion is included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in contingencies asbestos 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we have entered into contracts to hedge forecasted transactions occurring at various dates through december that are denominated in foreign currencies 
most of these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the contracts is reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is reported in income 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into income in the period when the hedged transactions occur 
pensions and postretirement benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and assumed health care cost trend rates 
assumptions are determined based on data available to us and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a material effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated statements of operations  as well as amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pension and postretirement benefits 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
temporary differences arising from the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet are used to calculate future income tax assets or liabilities 
this method also requires the recognition of deferred tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income losses in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
goodwill and other intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill  but instead it is subject to annual impairment testing 
the goodwill asset impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill is required to measure the potential goodwill impairment loss 
there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows which require management to apply judgment to the analysis of intangible asset impairment  including projecting revenues  interest rates  the cost of capital  royalty rates and tax rates 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and the expected effects on results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  if any 
contingencies general various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings with respect to commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  all arising in the ordinary course of business  are pending or threatened against us or our subsidiaries and seek monetary damages and or other remedies 
we believe that any liability that may finally be determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are also involved as plaintiffs in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection  environmental  insurance and other matters 
environmental our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the us and foreign countries 
we take a proactive approach in our efforts to comply with environmental  health and safety laws as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we also regularly conduct comprehensive environmental  health and safety audits at our facilities to maintain compliance and improve operational efficiency 

table of contents although we believe past operations were in substantial compliance with the then applicable regulations  we or one of our subsidiaries have been named as a potentially responsible party  or are otherwise involved  at sites where the costs to us are expected to exceed  investigations have been completed for sites and are in progress at the other four sites 
the majority of these sites relate to remediation projects at former operating facilities that were sold or closed and primarily deal with soil and groundwater contamination 
as of december  and  enpro had accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  for estimated future expenditures relating to environmental contingencies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our environmental contingencies 
colt firearms and central moloney we have contingent liabilities related to divested businesses for which certain of our subsidiaries retained liability or are obligated under indemnity agreements 
these contingent liabilities include  but are not limited to  potential product liability and associated claims related to firearms manufactured prior to by colt firearms  a former operation of coltec  and for electrical transformers manufactured prior to by central moloney  another former coltec operation 
coltec also has ongoing obligations  which are included in retained liabilities of previously owned businesses in our consolidated balance sheets  with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters that relate to coltec s periods of ownership of these operations 
crucible materials corporation crucible materials corporation crucible  which is engaged primarily in the manufacture and distribution of high technology specialty metal products  was a wholly owned subsidiary of coltec until when a majority of the outstanding shares were sold 
coltec divested its remaining minority interest in crucible filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in may see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain liabilities relating to coltec s ownership of crucible 
debt and capital lease guarantees as of december   we had contingent liabilities for potential payments on a guarantee of certain debt and lease obligations totaling million arising from the divestiture of crucible 
the obligations mature in in the event that crucible does not fulfill its obligations under the debt or lease agreements  we could be responsible for all or a portion of these obligations 
there is no liability for these guarantees reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
asbestos history 
certain of our subsidiaries  primarily garlock sealing technologies llc garlock and the anchor packing company anchor  are among a large number of defendants in actions filed in various states by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
among the many products at issue in these actions are industrial sealing products  including gaskets and packing products 
since the first asbestos related lawsuits were filed against garlock in  garlock and anchor have processed more than  asbestos claims to conclusion including judgments  settlements and dismissals and  together with their insurers  have paid over billion in settlements and judgments and over million in fees and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the disease mix in the claims  new claims recently filed  product defenses asserted by our subsidiaries  recent trial and appellate results  and settlements 

table of contents status of anchor 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
there is no remaining insurance coverage available to anchor 
anchor has no remaining assets and has not committed to settle any actions since as cases reach the trial stage  anchor is typically dismissed without payment 
insurance coverage 
at december   garlock had available million of insurance and trust coverage that we believe will be available to cover current and future asbestos claims and certain expense payments 
in addition  we believe that garlock may also recover some additional insurance from insolvent carriers over time 
garlock collected approximately million  million and million  respectively  from insolvent carriers in  and there can be no assurance that garlock will collect any additional insurance from insolvent carriers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the quality of garlock s insurance  arrangements for payments with certain insurers  the resolution of past insurance disputes  and coverage exclusions for exposure after july  our liability estimate 
prior to mid  we maintained that our subsidiaries liability for unasserted claims was not reasonably estimable 
we estimated and recorded liabilities only for pending claims in advanced stages of processing  for which we believed we had a basis for making a reasonable estimate 
we disclosed the significance of the total potential liability for unasserted claims in considerable detail 
during we authorized counsel to retain bates white to assist in estimating our subsidiaries liability for pending and future asbestos claims 
bates white s first report  dated february   provided an estimate of the liability as of december  for the following ten years  which represented a time horizon within which bates white believed such liability was both probable and estimable within a range of values 
bates white has updated its estimate regularly since the end of the estimated range of potential liabilities provided by bates white at december  was million to million 
according to bates white  increases in the range over time have been attributable primarily to the propensity to sue garlock  an increase in settlement values of mesothelioma claims  an increase in claims filings and values in some jurisdictions  most notably california  and the delay in  and uncertain impact of  the funding and implementation of trusts formed under section g of the united states bankruptcy code to pay asbestos claims against numerous defendants in chapter reorganization cases 
the g trusts are estimated by some  including bates white  to have more than billion dollars available for the payment of asbestos claims  with billions more scheduled to fund new trusts in cases currently nearing confirmation 
trust payments could have a significant impact on our future settlement payments and could therefore significantly affect our liability 
we have independently developed internal goals for asbestos related liabilities 
we have used those goals for a variety of purposes  including guidance for settlement negotiations and trial strategy  in our strategic planning  budgeting and cash flow planning processes  in setting targets for annual and long term incentive compensation  and in producing our own estimate of the current and future liability 
our internal estimate has been and continues to be within the bates white range of equally likely estimates 
as a result  bates white and management believe that our internal estimate for the next ten years represents the most likely point within the range 
accordingly  our recorded liability is derived from our internal estimate 
we currently estimate that the liability of our subsidiaries for the indemnity cost of resolving asbestos claims for the next ten years will be million 
the estimated liability of million is before any tax benefit and is not discounted to present value  and it does not include fees and expenses  which are recorded as incurred 
the recorded liability will continue to be impacted by actual claims and 
table of contents settlement experience and any change in the legal environment that could cause a significant increase or decrease in the long term expectations of management and bates white 
we expect the recorded liability to fluctuate  perhaps significantly 
any significant change in the estimated liability could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we made a significant adjustment discussed below to our liability based on an adjustment to our management estimate in the fourth quarter of we adjusted our estimate based on trends and factors also reflected in an increase in the high and low ends of the bates white liability estimate 
our estimate continues to fall within the bates white range  developed independently  and we believe that our estimate is the best estimate within the bates white range of reasonable and probable estimates of garlock s future obligation 
bates white also indicated a broader range of potential estimates from million to million 
we caution that points within that broader range remain possible outcomes 
also  while we agree with bates white that beyond two to four years for garlock s economically driven non malignant claims and beyond ten years for garlock s cancer claims and medically driven non malignant claims  there are reasonable scenarios in which the 
asbestos 
expenditure is de minimus  we caution that the process of estimating future liabilities is highly uncertain 
adjusting our liability to the best estimate within the range does not change that fact 
in the words of the bates white report  the reliability of estimates of future probable expenditures of garlock for asbestos related personal injury claims declines significantly for each year further into the future 
scenarios continue to exist that could result in total future asbestos related expenditures for garlock in excess of billion 
as previously mentioned  the liability estimate does not include legal fees and expenses  which add considerably to the costs each year 
over the last two years  these expenses have averaged approximately million per quarter 
in addition to these legal fees and expenses  we expect to continue to record charges to income in future quarters for increases or decreases  if any  in management s estimate of garlock s potential liability  plus increases  if any  that result from additional quarters added to maintain the ten year estimation period increases of this type have averaged approximately million per quarter for the last two years  plus amounts  if any  of solvent insurance lost or commuted  offset by insolvent recoveries and earnings from insurance settlement trusts 
in  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to reflect net cash outlays of million for legal fees and expenses paid during the year and a million non cash charge 
the non cash charge included million  primarily to add an estimate of the liability for to maintain a ten year estimate and million resulting from an adjustment in the fourth quarter of to management s estimate of the first nine years of the ten year period 
management s adjustment to its previous estimate was based on its review of mesothelioma claims filings and trends with respect to parties named as defendants in claims  settlement and payment trends  continued high activity in the court system  particularly in certain jurisdictions that management believes present particularly high risks for asbestos defendants  and  most importantly  the continuing difficulty caused by the lack of transparency in the distribution procedures of large g trusts of former co defendants that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings 
the ten year liability projections of management and bates white have both included an assumption that garlock s liability in the tort system would decrease as g trusts begin paying the 
table of contents liabilities of bankrupt former co defendants that contributed to injuries of plaintiffs who sue garlock 
this assumption has been based on principles of joint and several liability that caused the amount of payments to resolve asbestos claims against garlock to increase beginning in to  when the most prominent asbestos defendants sought bankruptcy protection and ceased paying claims in the tort system  the emergence  beginning in and continuing today  of numerous wealthy g trusts  established by such bankrupt companies to pay asbestos claims caused by their products  and state law that protects defendants like garlock from having to pay plaintiffs damages to the extent paid by such trusts and other co defendants 
payments from such trusts accordingly should offset and reduce damages claims against garlock 
while g trusts have begun making substantial payments to the claimants  garlock has not experienced a reduction in the damages being sought from garlock 
the distribution procedures of the g trusts do not permit garlock and other tort system co defendants from having any access to claims made to the trusts or the accompanying evidence of exposure to the asbestos containing products addressed by such trusts 
to date  despite billions of dollars of g trust distributions  many plaintiffs continue to seek damages from garlock on the basis that no evidence exists permitting them to recover from g trusts 
garlock and bates white are working on a variety of strategies to expose the unfairness of trust distribution procedures and bring fairness to the trust payment system 
both bates white and management assume that garlock will have some success in those endeavors over time  and that assumption continues to be embedded in our and bates white s liability estimates 
in  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to reflect net cash outlays of million for legal fees and expenses paid during the year and a million non cash charge 
the non cash charge included million  primarily to add an estimate of the liability for to maintain a ten year estimate and million to reduce the remaining insurance estimated to be available from remaining policies with various london market carriers 
in  we recorded a pre tax charge to income of million to reflect net cash outlays of million for legal fees and expenses incurred during the year  and a million non cash charge 
the non cash charge included million related to the addition of periods and million to adjust the liability based on revisions to management s estimate in the fourth quarter of we made this adjustment based on our review of negotiations and payment trends and our belief that it is more likely that  in the future  a higher percentage of settlement commitments made in any year will also be paid in that same year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our liability estimate

amounts shown include million  million and million at december   and  respectively  of accrued fees and expenses for services previously rendered but unpaid

strategy and outlook 
garlock s asbestos claims management strategy is to focus on trial listed cases  pursue training initiatives and research projects to improve its defense at trial  aggressively negotiate reduced settlement commitments and payments each year  carefully manage and maximize collections from a declining pool of available insurance coverage  and proactively support efforts to achieve meaningful asbestos reform 

table of contents beginning in  when the largest asbestos defendants filed bankruptcy cases to resolve their asbestos liabilities and thereby withdrew from the civil court system  plaintiffs pursued garlock and other surviving peripheral defendants in civil court actions to recover the full amounts of their alleged damages under state law principles of joint and several liability 
the plaintiffs could no longer pursue actions against these large defendants during the pendency of their bankruptcy proceedings  even though these defendants had historically been determined to be the largest contributors to asbestos related injuries 
as a result  the amount generally required to resolve each claim against garlock increased 
almost all of the high profile defendants that sought bankruptcy relief in the early s have now emerged  or are positioning to emerge  from bankruptcy 
their asbestos liabilities have been assumed by wealthy trusts created in the bankruptcies with assets contributed by the emerging former defendants and their affiliates 
with the emergence of these companies from bankruptcy  plaintiffs may seek to recover damages from the trusts 
legal principles of contribution and fundamental fairness should dictate that there be a consequent reduction in recoveries against other defendants  including garlock  who remain subject to the civil court system 
the bankruptcy trusts  however  operate pursuant to trust distribution procedures that do not permit garlock and other tort system co defendants to gain access to claims against trusts and accompanying evidence of exposure to asbestos containing products addressed by such trusts 
garlock s current efforts to achieve meaningful asbestos reform are focused on changing the trust distribution procedures to ensure full and transparent disclosure of evidence of the identities of recipients and amounts of payments from the trusts  and to facilitate credit for those payments in state civil court proceedings 
we believe garlock s efforts and similar efforts underway by other defendants and experts should result over time in a reduction of the value of damages claims against garlock to account for trust recoveries and thereby reduce garlock s payments necessary to resolve asbestos claims 
we and garlock are reviewing garlock s strategy with respect to the resolution of garlock s asbestos claims in light of changing trends and developments  including recent developments in pending bankruptcy proceedings of former co defendants 
we do not believe reductions resulting from trust payments over the next several years will offset the significant decline in insurance collections available to garlock in such years 
we therefore estimate that  while total payments to defend and resolve garlock s asbestos claims should continue to decline each year  the cash outflows  net of insurance  will increase  perhaps significantly  beginning in we believe that the continued risks inherent in the tort system may also impact garlock s future cash outflows 
despite garlock s successful recent track record at trial  the risk largely due to the exit from the civil court system of the high profile defendants that sought bankruptcy relief in the early s of large adverse verdicts in certain jurisdictions that have historically favored claims by asbestos plaintiffs continues to impact garlock s ability to negotiate reduced payments 
thus  there can be no assurance that garlock will be able to achieve significant payment reductions in the civil court system  particularly if claimants continue to have the ability to pursue claims in those plaintiff oriented jurisdictions  target selected defendants  and obscure evidence of their exposures to the products of former co defendants who have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings 
we believe that  as predicted in various epidemiological studies that are publicly available  the incidence of asbestos related disease is in decline and should continue to decline steadily over the next decade and thereafter 
as a result  claims activity against garlock should eventually decline to a level that can be paid from the cash flow from garlock s operations  even after garlock exhausts available insurance coverage 
however  there can be no assurance that epidemiological predictions about incidence of asbestos related disease will prove to be accurate  or that  even if they are  there will be a commensurate decline in the number of asbestos related claims filings against garlock 
in fact  after a significant decline in new mesothelioma filings in  the number of mesothelioma claims filed against garlock have increased in each of the last three years 

table of contents considering the foregoing  as well as the experience of our subsidiaries and other defendants in asbestos litigation  the likely sharing of judgments among multiple responsible defendants  bankruptcies of other defendants  and reform efforts  and given the amount of insurance coverage available to our subsidiaries from solvent insurance carriers  we believe that pending asbestos actions are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any given future period 
we anticipate that asbestos claims will continue to be filed against garlock 
because of the uncertainty as to the number and timing of such potential future claims and the amount that will have to be paid to litigate  settle or satisfy claims  and the finite amount of insurance available for future payments  future asbestos claims against garlock could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as a result  there can be no assurance that garlock s asbestos liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements lease agreements we have a number of operating leases primarily for real estate  equipment and vehicles 
operating lease arrangements are generally utilized to secure the use of assets from time to time if the terms and conditions of the lease or the nature of the asset makes the lease arrangement more favorable than a purchase 
as of december   approximately million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these agreements
