other risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed with the sec  and in particular those set forth under risk factors of this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc tco is a michigan corporation that operates as a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit 
the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg is a majority owned partnership subsidiary of tco  which owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties 
in this report  the terms we  us  and our refer to tco  the operating partnership  and or the operating partnership s subsidiaries as the context may require 
we own  lease  acquire  dispose of  develop  expand  and manage regional and super regional shopping centers 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements  the taubman company llc manager  and taubman properties asia llc and its subsidiaries taubman asia 
in september  we acquired the interests of the owner of partridge creek see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
prior to the acquisition  we consolidated the accounts of the owner of partridge creek  which qualified as a variable interest entity for which the operating partnership was considered to be the primary beneficiary 
shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our primary source of revenue is from the leasing of space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term  with our average lease term of new leases at approximately six years during and approximately seven years during  excluding temporary leases 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 
the real estate industry continues to face difficult times due to the impacts of the recent recession and tough capital market and retail environment 
although there have been some positive signs  unemployment continues to be very high and there is considerable uncertainty as to how long the impacts of the recession may continue 
we have seen the negative effect on our business in  and we expect that the economy will continue to strain the resources of our tenants and their customers 
a number of regional and national retailers have announced store closings or filed for bankruptcy 
during  of our tenants sought the protection of the bankruptcy laws  compared to and in and  respectively 
the highest level of bankruptcies we ve experienced in the last years for a full year was in both and tenant sales per square foot were in  a decrease from however  sales per square foot increased by in the fourth quarter of this is the first positive quarterly tenant sales performance since the third quarter of we are expecting sales to be flat to to up in see mall tenant sales and center revenues 
ending occupancy was at december   down from we anticipate occupancy will end the year flat in  although it is likely to be down as much as in the first three quarters of the year 
rent per square foot decreased for the fourth quarter of and decreased for the year 
we expect that average rents per square foot in will be down in comparison to by approximately to 
the rents we are able to achieve are affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
the spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature see seasonality 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of we recognized million of litigation charges related to westfarms mall  an unconsolidated joint venture  of which our share was million see results of operations litigation charges 
in the third quarter of  we concluded that the book values of the investments in the pier shops and regency square were impaired  which resulted in a non cash charge of million or million at our share 
we also recorded impairment charges in the fourth quarter of of million related to our oyster bay project in the town of oyster bay  new york oyster bay project or oyster bay and our sarasota project 
see results of operations impairment charges for further discussion and the status of the pier shops loan  which is in default 
in the first half of  in response to the decreased level of active projects due to the downturn in the economy  we reduced our workforce by about positions  primarily in areas that directly or indirectly affect our development initiatives in the us and asia 
the restructuring charge was million  and primarily represents the cost of terminations of personnel 
we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenue from management  leasing  and development services 
we disclose our share of these sources of income under results of operations other income 
we also describe the current status of our efforts to broaden our growth in asia see results of operations taubman asia 
we then provide a discussion of the impact in of recently issued accounting pronouncements including the new requirements for accounting for noncontrolling interests 
with all the preceding information as background  we then provide insight and explanations for variances in our financial results for   and under comparison of to and comparison of to as information useful to understanding our results  we have described the presentation of our noncontrolling interests  the presentation of certain interests in centers  and the reasons for our use of non gaap measures such as beneficial interests in ebitda and funds from operations ffo under results of operations use of non gaap measures 
reconciliations from net income loss and net income loss allocable to common shareowners to these measures follow the annual comparisons 
we then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements that will affect periods subsequent to our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under liquidity and capital resources begins with a brief overview of current market conditions and our financial position 
we have no maturities on our current debt until fall  when three loans mature with principal amounts of million at and million at our beneficial share and we are in discussions with a variety of lenders to refinance these three loans 
we then discuss our capital activities and transactions that occurred in analysis of specific operating  investing  and financing activities is then provided in more detail 
specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under liquidity and capital resources beneficial interest in debt 
completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under liquidity and capital resources sensitivity analysis 
also see liquidity and capital resources loan commitments and guarantees for discussion of compliance with debt covenants 
in conducting our business  we enter into various contractual obligations  including those for debt  capital leases for property improvements  operating leases for land and office space  purchase obligations  and other long term commitments 
detail of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  is contained under liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations 
property level debt represents the largest single class of obligations 
described under liquidity and capital resources loan commitments and guarantees and liquidity and capital resources cash tender agreement are our significant guarantees and commitments 
renovation and expansion of existing malls has been a significant use of our capital in recent years  as described in liquidity and capital resources capital spending and liquidity and capital resources capital spending planned capital spending 
our city creek center project  which we will own under a participating lease  is expected to open in early at which time a million payment will be made to the lessor 
with our sarasota project on hold and the continued delays on our oyster bay and asia projects  we expect capital spending in to consist primarily of tenant allowances and other capital expenditures on our operating centers 
dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources 
the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under liquidity and capital resources dividends 
mall tenant sales and center revenues our mall tenant sales per square foot statistics have shown improvement since july and in the fourth quarter of increased by compared to the prior year 
this is the first quarter sales have been up since third quarter for  our sales decreased to a level of per square foot 
over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs  and may be impacted significantly  either positively or negatively  by the success or lack of success of a small number of tenants or even a single tenant 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents that percentage rents represent of total rents approximately in 
while sales are critical over the long term  the high quality regional mall business has been a very stable business model with its diversity of income from thousands of tenants  its staggered lease maturities  and high proportion of fixed rent 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales mall tenant sales in thousands of dollars sales per square foot consolidated businesses minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales unconsolidated joint ventures minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales statistics exclude the pier shops 
in  mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales increased primarily due to the decline in sales during the year 
rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
generally  center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
in periods of increasing sales  rents on new leases will generally tend to rise 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  as we are experiencing now  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason  as tenants expectations of future growth become less optimistic 
rent per square foot information for centers in our consolidated businesses excluding the pier shops and unconsolidated joint ventures follows average rent per square foot  consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures opening base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla opened consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures closing base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla closed consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures releasing spread per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures opening and closing statistics exclude spaces greater than  square feet 
opening and closing statistics exclude spaces greater than  square feet 
average rent per square foot of the consolidated businesses in was impacted by increases in rent relief 
rent per square foot in is expected to be down to due to the annualization of rent relief granted in average rent per square foot of the unconsolidated joint ventures in was impacted by prior year adjustments totaling million at in  related to the mills corporation s accounting for lease incentives at arizona mills  a owned joint venture 
excluding these adjustments  average rent per square foot of the unconsolidated joint ventures would have been in the spread between opening and closing rents may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
in  the releasing spread per square foot of the unconsolidated joint ventures was impacted by the opening of large tenant spaces at a certain center 
mall tenant leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy rates are as follows leased space ending occupancy average occupancy statistics exclude the pier shops 
ending occupancy was  a decrease from in at  leased space is over the year end occupancy level  indicating a backlog of tenants who have committed to opening stores in the future 
we expect occupancy in to end the year flat with  although it is likely to be down as much as in the first three quarters of temporary tenant leasing continues to be strong and ended the year at about compared to in temporary tenants  defined as those with lease terms less than months  are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics 
tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was in  compared to in  and in seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school period 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
th rd nd st total quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands of dollars  except occupancy and leased space data mall tenant sales  revenues and gains on land sales and other nonoperating income consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures occupancy and leased space ending occupancy average occupancy leased space based on reports of sales furnished by mall tenants 
excludes the pier shops 
because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries as a percentage of sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter 
th rd nd st total quarter quarter quarter quarter consolidated businesses minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs unconsolidated joint ventures minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs excludes the pier shops 
results of operations in addition to the results and trends in our operations discussed in the preceding sections  the following sections discuss certain transactions that affected operations in the years ending   and  or are expected to affect operations in the future 
impairment charges in  we concluded that the book values of the investments in the pier shops and regency square were impaired  which resulted in a non cash charge of million or million at our share 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to our oyster bay project and our sarasota project 
the pier shops at caesars the pier shops  located in atlantic city  new jersey  began opening in phases in june gordon group holdings llc gordon developed the center  and in january  we assumed full management and leasing responsibility for the center 
in april  we increased our ownership in the pier shops to a controlling interest 
the remaining interest continues to be held by an affiliate of gordon 
we began consolidating the pier shops as of the april purchase date 
at closing  we made a million equity investment in the center  bringing our total equity investment to million at that date 
as of december   we had provided million of additional capital 
in september  our board of directors concluded that given long term prospects for the property  it was in our best interest to discontinue financial support of the pier shops 
cash flows generated from the center are insufficient to cover debt service on the million non recourse mortgage loan 
as a result  the book value of the pier shops was written down by million our share of which is million to a fair value of approximately million 
the loan is now in default 
under the terms of the agreement  interest accrues at the original stated rate of plus a default rate 
although we are no longer funding any cash shortfalls  we continue to record the operations of the center  and interest on the loan  in our results until title for the center has been transferred and our obligation for the loan is extinguished 
while the timing is uncertain as the foreclosure process is not in our control  we are hoping to transfer ownership in the second quarter of we expect the non cash impact of owning the pier shops including default interest to result in an incremental earnings charge  excluding depreciation and amortization  of approximately million per month in including the impact of depreciation and amortization  the impact on earnings is expected to be million per month 
regency square in september  we concluded that the book value of the investment in regency square was also impaired based on current estimates of future cash flows for the property  which will be negatively impacted by necessary capital expenditures and declining net operating income 
as a result  the book value of the property was written down by million to a fair value of approximately million 
at the current level of cash flows  regency square intends to continue to service its million non recourse mortgage loan 
the pier shops and regency square generate less than two percent of our net operating income

oyster bay in january  the appellate division of the supreme court of the state of new york  second department  reversed the supreme court s order directing the town board of the town of oyster bay to issue a special use permit for the construction of the mall at oyster bay 
the court also held that the town board s request for a supplemental environmental impact statement was proper 
we determined in february that we would recognize in the fourth quarter of a charge to income of million relating to the oyster bay project  including million in costs  which were paid in  associated with obligations under existing contracts related to the project 
this determination was reached after an overall assessment of the probability of the development of the mall as designed and a review of our previously capitalized project costs 
the charge included the costs of previous development activities as well as holding and other costs that management believes will likely not benefit the development if and when we obtain the rights to build the center 
in june  the court of appeals of the state of new york denied our motion for leave to appeal the january decision of the appellate division of the supreme court of the state of new york 
we have been expensing costs relating to oyster bay since the fourth quarter of and will continue to do so until it is probable that we will be able to successfully move forward with a project 
our remaining capitalized investment in the project as of december  is million  consisting of land and site improvements 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining the right to build the center  it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the full amount of this capitalized investment through alternate uses of the land 
sarasota in may  we entered into agreements to jointly develop university town center  a regional mall in sarasota  florida 
under the agreements  we would own a noncontrolling interest in the project 
due to the economic and retail environment  we announced in december that the project had been put on hold 
although we continue to believe it should be a very attractive opportunity longer term  we do not know if or when we will acquire an interest in the land and move forward with the project 
due to this uncertainty  we recognized an million charge to income in the fourth quarter of the charge to income represented our share of total project costs 
we have no asset remaining and will continue to expense any additional costs related to the monitoring of the project until a definitive agreement is reached by the parties on going forward with the project 
litigation charges in the fourth quarter of  we recognized litigation charges relating to the settlement of two lawsuits related to westfarms  our center in west hartford  connecticut 
the settlements include million settled in december and million settled in january  of which our share of the total settlements was million see note commitments and contingencies litigation 
restructuring in the first half of  in response to the decreased level of active projects due to the downturn in the economy  we reduced our workforce by about positions  primarily in areas that directly or indirectly affect our development initiatives in the us and asia 
the restructuring charge was million  and primarily represents the cost of terminations of personnel 
center operations the impacts of the recession  which negatively impacted our operating statistics in as discussed in the previous sections  are expected to continue to affect operations in we expect that net operating income noi of our centers  excluding lease cancellation income  could decrease by to in the expected noi decrease is impacted by over related to recoveries of cam capital expenditures as we manage our tenants cam costs to reduce overall expenses 
we also expect rent relief to have a significant negative impact in as rent relief contracted in is fully annualized 
other income we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenues from management  leasing  and development services  as summarized in the following table 
lease cancellation revenue is primarily dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and can vary significantly 
gains on peripheral land sales can also vary significantly from year to year  depending on the results of negotiations with potential purchasers of land  as well as the economy and the timing of the transactions 
during the year ended december   we recognized our approximately million and million share of the consolidated businesses and unconsolidated joint ventures lease cancellation revenue  respectively 
lease cancellation income over the last five years ranged from million to this year s record high  and is likely to be much lower in at about million to million

taubman asia in  taubman asia entered into agreements to acquire a interest in the mall at studio city  the retail component of macao studio city  a major mixed use project on the cotai strip in macao  china 
in august  our macao agreements terminated and our million initial cash payment was returned to us because the financing for the project was not completed 
in the fourth quarter of we recognized approximately million of development fees collected for services performed primarily prior to on the macao project 
in  we entered into an agreement to provide development services for a million square foot retail and entertainment complex called riverstone in songdo international business district songdo  incheon  south korea 
we also finalized an agreement to provide management and leasing services for riverstone 
the shopping center will be anchored by lotte department store  tesco homeplus  and a nine screen megabox multiplex 
construction has been completed on the mall infrastructure and parking  including the subway station that will connect the mall to seoul 
however  the project financing of riverstone remains unresolved due to market conditions and the overall complexity and scale of the broader songdo financings 
once financing is complete  full construction will begin and we will make a determination about an investment in this center 
debt transactions we completed a series of debt financings in and as follows initial loan stated date balance facility interest rate maturity date in millions of dollars fair oaks april libor april international plaza january libor january trg revolving credit facility november libor february the pier shops at caesars april may excludes any options to extend the maturities see the footnotes to our financial statements regarding extension options

the loan is swapped at for the initial three year term of the loan agreement 
in november  we increased the borrowing limit on the trg revolving credit facility by million and extended the maturity date by two years  with a one year extension option 
borrowings under trg s revolving credit facility are primary obligations of the entities owning dolphin  fairlane  and twelve oaks  which are collateral for the line of credit 
the operating partnership and the entities owning fairlane and twelve oaks are guarantors under the credit agreement 
partnership unit redemptions and common share repurchases we also completed a series of partnership unit redemptions and common share repurchases in price of shares amount per share date in millions of dollars stock repurchases  august stock repurchases  may june for each common share repurchased  a unit of trg partnership interest is similarly redeemed 
see note common and preferred stock and equity of trg to our consolidated financial statements regarding the repurchase of our common stock 
presentation of operating results the following table contains the operating results of our consolidated businesses and the unconsolidated joint ventures 
on january   we adopted the new requirements of asc topic consolidation as it relates to noncontrolling interests formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
the new requirements of asc amended prior accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest previously referred to as a minority interest in a subsidiary 
consequently  the noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership and certain consolidated joint ventures no longer need to be carried at zero balances in our balance sheet 
as a result  the income allocated to these noncontrolling interests is no longer required to be equal  at a minimum  to their share of distributions  which results in a material increase to our net income 
prior to  under the previous accounting for noncontrolling interests  the income allocated to the operating partnership noncontrolling unitholders was equal to their share of distributions as long as the net equity of the operating partnership was less than zero 
similarly  the income allocated to the noncontrolling partners in consolidated joint ventures with net equity balances less than zero was equal to their share of operating distributions 
the net equity balances of the operating partnership and certain of the consolidated joint ventures were less than zero because of accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses 
distributions to partners were usually greater than net income because net income includes non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
our average ownership percentage of the operating partnership was in and  and in upon our adoption of the new accounting for noncontrolling interests  net income was reclassified to include the amounts attributable to the noncontrolling interests 
however  as the new accounting is applicable beginning with the january  adoption date  the interests of these noncontrolling interests for prior periods have not been remeasured 
the results of the pier shops are presented within the consolidated businesses for periods beginning april   as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in the center 
prior to the acquisition date  the results of the pier shops are included within the unconsolidated joint ventures 
use of non gaap measures we use net operating income noi as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers  both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases 
we define noi as property level operating revenues includes rental income excluding straightline adjustments of minimum rent less maintenance  taxes  utilities  ground rent  and other property operating expenses 
since noi excludes general and administrative expenses  pre development charges  interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  restructuring charges  and gains from land and property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared period over period  reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties  as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales  occupancy and rental rates  and operating costs 
the operating results in the following table include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents our share of the earnings before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
our presentations of beneficial interest in ebitda and ffo are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income loss or as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  neither represents cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reconciliations of net income loss allocable to common shareowners to funds from operations and net income loss to beneficial interest in ebitda are presented following the comparison of to comparison of to the following table sets forth operating results for and  showing the results of the consolidated businesses and unconsolidated joint ventures unconsolidated unconsolidated consolidated joint ventures consolidated joint ventures businesses at businesses at in millions of dollars revenues minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries management  leasing  and development services other total revenues expenses maintenance  taxes  and utilities other operating management  leasing  and development services general and administrative litigation charges impairment charges restructuring charge interest expense depreciation and amortization total expenses gains on land sales and other nonoperating income impairment loss on marketable securities loss before income tax expense and equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures income tax expense equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures net loss net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests noncontrolling share of income of consolidated joint ventures distributions in excess of noncontrolling share of income of consolidated joint ventures trg series f preferred distributions noncontrolling share of loss of trg distributions in excess of noncontrolling share of loss of trg distributions to participating securities of trg preferred stock dividends loss attributable to taubman centers  inc common shareowners supplemental information ebitda ebitda outside partners share beneficial interest in ebitda beneficial interest expense beneficial income tax expense non real estate depreciation preferred dividends and distributions funds from operations contribution with the exception of the supplemental information  amounts include of the unconsolidated joint ventures

consolidated businesses total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a million or decrease over minimum rents decreased by million  due to decreases in rent per square foot  primarily as a result of rent relief  and decreased average occupancy 
percentage rents decreased due to lower tenant sales 
expense recoveries decreased primarily due to decreases in occupancy and the lower level of recoveries from in place tenants 
management  leasing  and development revenue increased primarily due to the collection of development fees on the macao project 
other income increased primarily due to an increase in lease cancellation revenue  which was partially offset by decreases in parking related revenue and sponsorship income 
total expenses were million  a million or increase from other operating expense decreased due to a reduction in pre development costs  lower costs related to marketing and promotion  and decreased bad debt expense

also in  we recognized impairment charges of million on the pier shops and regency square 
in  we recognized a million impairment charge on our oyster bay project see results of operations impairment charges 
interest expense decreased due to the lower rates on floating rate debt and lower outstanding debt as a result of the return of the macao deposit  offset partially by the termination of interest capitalization on the oyster bay project in the fourth quarter of gains on land sales and other nonoperating income decreased by million in there were no gains on land sales in  compared to million of gains in in  gains on land sales are expected to be approximately million to million 
interest income declined in due to overall lower average interest rates 
unconsolidated joint ventures total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a million or increase from percentage rents decreased primarily due to lower tenant sales 
expense recoveries increased primarily due to increases in property taxes and electricity recoveries  increased revenue from marketing and promotion services  and adjustments in to prior estimated recoveries at certain centers 
total expenses increased by million or  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to litigation charges of million recognized in see results of operations litigation charges 
maintenance  taxes  and utilities expense increased due to higher property taxes  partially offset by decreased electricity expense 
other operating expense increased primarily due to professional fees 
depreciation expense decreased primarily due to changes in depreciable lives of tenant allowances in connection with early terminations

consolidated businesses total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a million or increase over minimum rents increased million  primarily due to the october opening of partridge creek  the september expansion at twelve oaks  and the pier shops  which we began consolidating in april upon the acquisition of a controlling interest in the center 
minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers and increases in average occupancy 
percentage rents decreased due to lower tenant sales 
expense recoveries increased primarily due to partridge creek  twelve oaks  and the pier shops  as well as increased cam capital expenditures and recoverable costs at certain centers 
management  leasing  and development revenue decreased primarily due to lower revenue on the songdo development contract  which in the first quarter of included revenue related to services  and was partially offset by increased revenue from our salt lake city project 
other income increased primarily due to increases in parking related and sponsorship revenue  which were partially offset by a decrease in lease cancellation revenue

interest expense increased primarily due to the january refinancing at international plaza  partridge creek  and the pier shops 
interest expense also increased due to the termination of interest capitalization on our oyster bay project in the fourth quarter of  the repurchase of common stock in  the escrowed macao payment  and the expansion at twelve oaks 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in floating interest rates 
depreciation expense increased due to partridge creek  the pier shops  and twelve oaks 
gains on land sales and other nonoperating income increased primarily due to million of gains on land sales and land related rights in  compared to million of gains in this increase was partially offset by decreased interest income 
income tax expense in consists of taxes related to the michigan business tax act  which became effective january  see results of operations application of critical accounting policies valuation of deferred tax assets 
the new tax replaced the michigan single business tax  which was previously classified within other operating expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
unconsolidated joint ventures total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a million or increase from minimum rents increased by million  primarily due to tenant rollovers  the november expansion at stamford  increased income from specialty retailers  and prior year adjustments at arizona mills in these increases were partially offset by the reduction due to the consolidation of the pier shops and decreases due to frictional vacancy on spaces that opened in the second half of the year 
percentage rents decreased due to lower tenant sales 
expense recoveries increased primarily due to increased maintenance costs at certain centers  stamford  and an increase in revenue from marketing and promotion services  which were partially offset by the pier shops and decreases due to adjustments in to prior estimated recoveries at certain centers

as a result of the foregoing  income of the unconsolidated joint ventures increased by million to million 
we had an effective interest in the pier shops based on relative equity contributions  prior to our acquisition of a controlling interest in april our equity in income of the unconsolidated joint ventures was million  a million decrease from in  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to our investment in university town center see results of operations impairment charges 
the charge to income represents our share of our sarasota joint venture project costs 
net income loss net income loss decreased by million to a million loss for  due to the impairment charges 
after allocation of income to noncontrolling and preferred interests  the net income loss allocable to common shareowners for was a loss of million compared to million of income in application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers the viability of all projects under construction or development  including those owned by unconsolidated joint ventures  are regularly evaluated under applicable accounting requirements  including requirements relating to abandonment of assets or changes in use 
to the extent a project  or individual components of the project  are no longer considered to have value  the related capitalized costs are charged against operations 
additionally  all properties are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities is recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value  including the results of discounted cash flow and other valuation techniques 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  expected holding period  and availability of credit 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income 
in  we recognized impairment charges of million and million related to the pier shops and regency square  respectively 
in  we recognized impairment charges of million and million related to our oyster bay and sarasota projects  respectively see results of operations impairment charges 
there were no impairment charges recognized in as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations see presentation of operating results 
on an ongoing basis  we continue to assess the probability of a project going forward and whether the asset is impaired 
in addition  we also assess whether there are sufficient substantive development activities in a given period to support the capitalization of carrying costs  including interest capitalization  in that period 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 
our million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists primarily of million of costs relating to our oyster bay project 
the balance also includes approximately million of land and improvement costs for a parcel in north atlanta  georgia  which was acquired for future development 
a portion of this land is expected to be sold for various uses 
see impairment charges regarding the status of the oyster bay project 
valuation of accounts and notes receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent approximately of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was less than of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenant leases during the year 
since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
notes receivable at december  totaled million 
valuation of the recoverability of notes receivable is dependent on management s estimates of the collectibility of contractual principal and interest payments  which are inherently judgmental 
valuation of deferred tax assets we currently have deferred tax assets  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
our temporary differences primarily relate to deferred compensation  net operating loss carryforwards and depreciation 
we reduce our deferred tax assets through valuation allowances to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured  considering all available evidence  including expected future taxable earnings and potential tax planning strategies 
expected future taxable earnings and the implementation of tax planning strategies require certain significant judgments and estimates  including those relating to our management company s profitability  the timing and amounts of gains on land sales  the profitability of our asian operations  the profitability of the unitary filing group for the michigan business tax  and other factors affecting the results of operations of our taxable reit subsidiaries 
changes in any of these factors could cause our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets to change materially 
in july  the state of michigan signed into law the michigan business tax act  replacing the michigan single business tax with a business income tax and modified gross receipts tax 
these new taxes became effective on january   and are subject to the accounting requirements for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net federal  state and foreign deferred tax asset of million  after a valuation allowance of million 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important for the recording of the acquisition at fair value  and allocation of purchase price between land  building and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb made changes to asc topic consolidation asc 
these changes eliminate certain scope exceptions previously permitted  provide additional guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity  and require companies to more frequently reassess whether they must consolidate variable interest entities 
the changes also replace the previously required quantitative approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity with a requirement for an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
changes are effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
we anticipate the statement will not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position  as we do not currently have any variable interest or interests that give us a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in accordance with asc in september  the fasb ratified the eitf s consensus on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  contained in accounting standards update no 
this consensus amends previous accounting guidance on separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this consensus eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price 
this consensus also establishes a selling price hierarchy based on available evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable  i first on vendor specific objective evidence  ii then third party evidence  and iii then the estimated selling price 
this consensus also requires that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
this consensus is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the application of the eitf s consensus on our results of operations and financial position

dividends we pay regular quarterly dividends to our common and series g and series h preferred shareowners 
dividends to our common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to us  our financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income prior to net capital gains to our shareowners  as well as meet certain other requirements 
we must pay these distributions in the taxable year the income is recognized  or in the following taxable year if they are declared during the last three months of the taxable year  payable to shareowners of record on a specified date during such period and paid during january of the following year 
such distributions are treated as paid by us and received by our shareowners on december of the year in which they are declared 
in addition  at our election  a distribution for a taxable year may be declared in the following taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
these distributions qualify as dividends paid for the reit distribution test for the previous year and are taxable to holders of our capital stock in the year in which paid 
preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends 
the annual determination of our common dividends is based on anticipated funds from operations available after preferred dividends and our reit taxable income  as well as assessments of annual capital spending  financing considerations  and other appropriate factors 
we intend to continue to pay dividends in cash in  subject to our board of directors approval 
any inability of the operating partnership or its joint ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts  capital expenditures and changes in working capital  including development activities and expansions  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations  thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the operating partnership and funds available to us for the payment of dividends
