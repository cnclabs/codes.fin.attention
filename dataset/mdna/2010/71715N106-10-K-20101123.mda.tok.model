in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  such as our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions set forth in the section titled forward looking statements  which can be found at the beginning of this report  and in item a  risk factors 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering  developing  and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections 
our primary focus is on the development of nucleoside tide analogs as oral therapeutics for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus hcv infection 
nucleoside tide analogs are a class of compounds which act as alternative substrates for the viral polymerase  thus inhibiting viral replication 
we currently have three clinical stage product candidates  two of which we are developing ourselves and one of which we are developing with a strategic partner 
we are also advancing a series of preclinical candidates in preparation for clinical development 
our three clinical stage product candidates are rg  an hcv cytosine nucleoside polymerase inhibitor we are developing through a strategic collaboration with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd and hoffmann la roche inc collectively  roche 
roche recently presented data from a week interim analysis from the phase b propel study of rg in combination with pegasys pegylated interferon plus copegus ribavirin  the standard of care for treating hcv soc in patients with hcv genotypes or in addition  rg is in a week phase b jump c study in combination with soc in patients with hcv genotypes or roche is planning to conduct the next study of rg in combination with ritonavir boosted danoprevir 
this inform svr study is part of a series of studies designed to investigate the combination of two oral  direct acting antivirals daas in the absence of pegylated interferon 
roche is also planning to conduct a phase b study in patients with hcv genotypes or all of these studies are being conducted by roche  psi  an hcv uracil nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor that is in a week phase b study in combination with soc in patients with hcv genotypes  or  and psi  an hcv guanine nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor that is screening patients for part of a phase study with psi in patients with hcv genotype in addition  we are developing psi  an hcv guanine nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor we nominated as a development candidate in october psi is in preclinical studies required for submission of an investigational new drug ind application with the us food and drug administration fda or equivalent foreign regulatory application 
psi or psi could potentially be used in combination with our current nucleoside tide analogs  rg or psi  as well as other classes of daas 
given the similarities of psi and psi  our plan is to select one of these product candidates for later stage clinical development based upon a review of the early human clinical trial results of both psi and psi we are continuing to research nucleoside tide analogs both pyrimidines and purines with the intention of identifying additional product candidates that can potentially be used in combination with our nucleoside tides  rg and psi  in combination with other classes of daas  or with soc for the treatment of hcv 
we have identified proprietary nucleotide prodrugs that are referred to as phosphate prodrugs because they have the ability to deliver the biologically available monophosphate forms of the compounds into infected liver cells  thus bypassing a rate limiting step in the metabolic pathway to the active triphosphate form of the drug 
the goal of these efforts is to identify compounds with improved potency  safety  convenience  oral bioavailability  and 
table of contents increased intrahepatic nucleotide triphosphate levels 
certain of these compounds have demonstrated exceptional in vitro anti hcv activity  with up to times greater potency than psi of which rg is a prodrug 
early studies in animals indicate that several of these compounds can achieve concentrations of the active triphosphate form in the liver up to times higher than psi at equivalent doses 
we are developing psi  psi  and psi ourselves 
we have a strategic collaboration with roche for the development of psi and its prodrugs  including rg under the collaboration  roche pays all development costs associated with rg and provides us with potential income from milestone payments that can be used to fund the advancement of our proprietary product candidates 
despite substantial advances  there remain significant unmet medical needs in hcv 
in the treatment of hcv  pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin is the current standard of care and has demonstrated  for some patients  the ability to offer a sustained virologic response  or svr  defined as hcv rna levels that are below the limit of detection by a standard test utilizing polymerase chain reaction  or pcr  six months after discontinuation of therapy 
however  pegylated interferon is available only in an injectable formulation and is associated with side effects  some of them serious  which may include fatigue  bone marrow suppression  anemia  and neuropsychiatric effects 
many individuals with hcv infection are unable to be treated with interferon due to pre existing co morbidities such as advanced liver disease or psychiatric conditions 
in the treatment of hcv  there is an unmet medical need for orally administered therapies that offer an improved svr rate with an improved safety profile 
we believe nucleoside tide analogs are well suited to treat hcv infection because they are commonly used to treat other viral diseases  can be designed to be highly specific and potent inhibitors of hcv replication  are relatively simple to manufacture  and can be administered orally 
in hcv  nucleoside tide analog drugs have demonstrated a higher barrier to viral resistance than non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors  protease inhibitors and nsa inhibitors for hcv 
in addition  this class of compounds has a well established development and regulatory history 
there are nucleoside analogs for the treatment of hbv and hiv that have been approved by the fda and as a class are standard of care 
additional nucleoside analogs have been approved by the fda for the treatment of hcv  cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 
the nucleoside tide analogs rg  psi  psi  and psi are progressing in preclinical and clinical development 
we are also continuing our discovery programs focused on other nucleoside tide analogs for treating hcv 
our scientific team of virologists  biologists  and chemists has experience discovering and developing nucleoside tide analog drugs for antiviral indications 
collectively  our management team s product development experience includes approximately therapeutic and diagnostic product approvals 
our discovery platform includes a library of nucleoside tide analogs and a collection of viral and cellular assays that we use to evaluate new product candidates 
racivir  our product candidate for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  has completed a phase clinical trial 
our goal is to conduct future clinical trials with a collaborator that will study combination therapies that include racivir for hiv patients receiving second line therapy 

table of contents our hcv product candidates our research and development programs are primarily focused on discovering and developing drugs that treat hcv 
our product candidates are nucleoside tide analogs that we believe have potential competitive advantages with respect to safety  efficacy  drug resistance  and or convenience of dosing as compared to currently approved drugs and other known investigational agents 
the following table summarizes the four product candidates on which we are focusing product candidate status next expected milestone s commercialization partner rg completing the phase b propel study and week phase b jump c study in patients with hcv genotypes or  and planning for an inform svr study and a phase b study in patients with hcv genotypes or all of these studies are being conducted by roche initiate inform svr study during the first calendar quarter of  and initiate a phase b study in patients with hcv genotypes or during the first half of calendar year initiate a phase program during all of these studies are being or are expected to be conducted by roche roche psi in a week phase b dose finding study in patients with hcv genotypes   or report preliminary week safety results from the genotype arm of the phase b study during the first calendar quarter of and report svr results from the genotype arm during the second calendar quarter of initiate a longer duration phase b study in combination with soc during the second calendar quarter of psi is screening patients for part of a phase study with psi in treatment na ve patients with hcv genotype report preliminary results from part of the phase study during the first calendar quarter of  and initiate a phase combination study in mid calendar quarter psi in ind enabling preclinical studies submit ind application during the first calendar quarter of and initiate a phase study during the second calendar quarter of svr sustained viral response  or svr  is defined as a patient with hcv rna below the limit of detection iu ml weeks after the discontinuation of therapy 
financial history we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception because we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development activities and have not generated any revenue from the sale of approved drugs 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our operating losses to increase for at least the next few years as we continue to pursue the clinical development of psi  psi  and psi and as we expand our discovery and development pipeline 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments received under collaboration agreements  borrowings under our loan agreement  and interest earned on investments 
we expect to continue to fund our operations over the next several years through the net proceeds from our completed public offerings  our existing cash resources  borrowings under our loan agreement  potential future milestone 
table of contents payments that we expect to receive from roche if certain conditions are satisfied  interest earned on our investments  and additional capital to be raised through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
as of september   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
revenues all of our product candidates are currently in development and  therefore  we do not expect to generate any direct revenues from product sales for at least the next few years  if at all 
our revenues to date have been generated primarily from milestone payments under our collaboration agreements  license fees  and research funding 
we currently have one collaboration agreement with roche for the development of rg we entered into our collaboration agreement with roche in october roche subsequently paid us an up front payment of million 
as of september   we had received an aggregate of million in payments under the roche collaboration agreement  including research funding and related fees as well as up front and milestone payments 
under the current terms of the roche collaboration agreement  if we and roche succeed in obtaining all of the regulatory approvals specified in the agreement for rg  as of september  the maximum future development and commercialization milestone payments payable to us is million 
receipt of any additional milestone payments depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will receive any of these future payments 
we expect our revenues for at least the next few years to be derived primarily from payments under our current collaboration agreement with roche and any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future 
in addition to the payments described above  we may receive future royalties on product sales  if any  under our collaboration agreement with roche 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  fees paid to external service providers  up front and milestone payments under our license agreements  patent related legal fees  costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials  drug and laboratory supplies  and costs for facilities and equipment 
we use external service providers to manufacture our product candidates for clinical trials and for the majority of our preclinical and clinical development work 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are then recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed  or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided 
our research activities are primarily focused on discovering and developing novel drugs to treat hcv 
our development activities are primarily focused on the development of rg in collaboration with roche  psi  psi  and psi for the treatment of hcv 
we are responsible for all costs incurred in the clinical development of psi  psi  and psi  as well as the research costs associated with our other internal research programs 
under our collaboration with roche  roche will fund the clinical development and commercialization of rg under this collaboration  roche reimbursed us for all of the external expenses associated with  and we were responsible for  certain preclinical work  the ind filing  and the proof of concept clinical trial 
during december  we transferred the ind application for rg to roche 
roche will continue to fund all of the expenses of  and be responsible for  other preclinical studies and future clinical development of rg in the territories licensed to roche 
we and roche will continue to jointly oversee all development and marketing activities of rg in the territories licensed to roche 
roche received a license only to psi and its pro drugs  including rg 
table of contents we use our internal research and development resources  including our employees and discovery infrastructure  across various projects 
our related internal expenses are not attributable to a specific project  but are directed to broadly applicable research activities 
accordingly  we do not account for our internal research and development expenses on a project basis 
we use external service providers to manufacture our product candidates for clinical trials and for the substantial majority of our preclinical and clinical development work 
we have tracked some of these external research and development expenses on a project basis 
to the extent that expenses are not attributable to a specific project  they are included in one of the unattributed expenses in the table below 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for our development projects for each of the three years ended september    and years ended september  cumulative project costs in thousands expenses attributed to projects rg studies psi including psi studies psi studies psi including psi studies phase racivir studies clevudine studies total attributed expenses unattributed expenses salaries and related personnel expenses non cash stock compensation expense legal expenses associated with patents preclinical studies and new drug discovery services drug and laboratory supplies consulting expense facility and other expenses total unattributed expenses total research and development expenses roche is responsible for all of the expenses associated with the research and development of rg in april  we voluntarily terminated our phase registration studies of clevudine for the treatment of hepatitis b virus 
we completed the termination process during the first fiscal quarter of we will continue to make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis 
these determinations will be made in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program specific expenses through commercialization for any of our product candidates  as there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates  including future trial design and various regulatory requirements such as competitive final product labeling and reasonable risk management programs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
for example  product candidates may be found ineffective or may cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  or may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and 
table of contents with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of seeking fda and other regulatory agency approvals requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our product development effort and financial condition 
because of these and other risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of any of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost or whether we will obtain any approval required by the fda or other regulatory agencies on a timely basis  if at all 
as we obtain results from clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay preclinical studies or clinical trials for a product candidate or development program in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions  including accounting  finance  legal  business development  investor relations  information technology  and human resources 
other significant general and administration costs include facilities costs and professional fees for outside accounting and legal services  travel  insurance premiums  and depreciation 
results of operations year ended september  compared with year ended september  revenues 
revenues were million and million during and  respectively 
revenues during and include million and million  respectively  of amortization of up front and subsequent collaborative and license payments received from roche previously recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues during also include a million milestone payment from roche for initiating a phase b study of rg and million of research and development payments from roche for activities related to holding the ind application for rg  for which we have no continuing performance obligations 
our performance obligations relating to the million milestone payment consisted of successfully completing a phase study of rg  which led to the initiation of the phase b study for rg that triggered the milestone payment 
the following is a reconciliation between cash payments received under contract revenue agreements and contract revenues reported years ended september  in thousands cash received receivable deferred amortization revenues research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million during from million in this net decrease of million consists primarily of a million decrease in clinical trial expenses for clevudine resulting from our voluntary termination of our phase registration studies of clevudine  which was completed as of december   and a million decrease in research collaboration expenses 
mostly offsetting this decrease were increases of million  million  and million in clinical trial and preclinical study costs for psi  psi  and psi  respectively  and an increase of million for non cash stock compensation 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million during  an increase of million from million in the net increase of million was due to an increase of million in legal expenses incurred in connection with our defense against the demand for arbitration and relief see part i  item legal proceedings  for additional information partially offset by reductions of million in marketing expense  million of insurance expense  million of consulting expense  and million in other administrative expenses 
investment income 
investment income decreased to thousand in from million in the decrease was primarily due to significantly lower rates of return on the average invested cash balances 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense was due to a lower amount of long term debt outstanding during compared to income taxes 
as of september   we had united states federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income  if any 
of the federal nols  million was generated from windfall tax benefit stock option deductions 
the tax benefit of this portion of the nol will be accounted for directly to equity as additional paid in capital as the stock option related losses are utilized 
as of september  we also had research and development tax credits of approximately million available to offset future tax liabilities 
as of september   we had a net deferred tax asset of million  before consideration of a valuation allowance 
we established a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset as it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized 
the loss carryovers and the research and development tax credits expire over a period of to under section of the internal revenue code the code  utilization of the nol and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a limitation if a change in ownership of the company  as defined in the code  occurred previously or could occur in the future 
the company completed a section analysis regarding limitation of its nol and research and development credit carryforwards that covered the period three years prior to its ipo on may  through a public offering of its common stock on february   and concluded that a change in control occurred at the company during the quarter ended september  this change in control limits the future use of the company s nol and research and development credit carryforwards from fiscal and prior years 
however  based upon the company s financial projections  it does not believe that this limitation will result in the expiration of any of these nol and research and development credit carryforwards before they are able to be utilized 
the company is in the process of assessing whether another change in control occurred since the quarter ended september  and expects to disclose the results of this assessment when it is complete 
such a change and any future changes in ownership could impact the use of the company s nol and research and development credit carryforwards generated in the affected years 
any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the nol or research and development credit carryforwards before utilization  which would reduce the company s gross deferred tax assets

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through public and private offerings of our equity securities  payments received under our collaboration agreements  and borrowings under our loan agreement 
since our inception  we have raised approximately million in net proceeds from sales of our equity securities  and borrowed a total of million under our loan agreement entered into on september  at september   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and have invested substantially all of our available cash and cash equivalents in a money market fund  which invests in short term us treasury and agency obligations 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million during the years ended september    and  respectively 
the million increase in net cash used in operating activities during  as compared to  was due primarily to a decrease in revenues of million  as the revenues in include milestone payments totaling million from roche

the net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended september  includes million of net proceeds from the common stock offering we completed in july  borrowings of long term debt of million under the loan agreement we entered into during september  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
on september   we entered into a loan agreement that allowed us to borrow up to million in million increments 
we borrowed the first and second million increments by signing two secured promissory notes notes a and b on october  and march  notes a and b bear interest at 
on december   we amended the loan agreement and borrowed million by signing a secured promissory note note c 
note c bears interest at 
notes a  b  and c are to be repaid over a month period with the first monthly payments representing interest only followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest 
the principal monthly payments on each of the notes begin and end as follows note begin end note a march  august  note b august  january  note c may  october

future total principal repayments of the three notes amount to million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal there are no additional borrowings available under the loan agreement 
under the loan agreement  we agreed that in the event our market capitalization is below million for consecutive days in which the principal market for our common stock is open for trading to the public  we will be required to repay of the then outstanding principal balance of the loans 
we further agreed that in the event our market capitalization is below million for consecutive days in which the principal market for our common stock is open for trading to the public  we will be required to repay all of the then outstanding principal balance of the loans 
the loan agreement also contains covenants that  among other things  require us to obtain consent from the lender prior to paying dividends  making certain investments  changing the nature of our business  assuming or guaranteeing the indebtedness of another entity or individual  selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets  or merging or consolidating with another entity 
developing drugs  conducting clinical trials and commercializing products is expensive and we will need to raise additional funds to achieve our strategic objectives 
although we believe our existing cash resources  together with anticipated payments under our existing collaboration agreement will be sufficient to fund our projected cash requirements for at least the next months  we will require significant additional financing in the future to complete our clinical trials for psi  psi  and psi  to fund our portion  if any  of the cost of clinical trials for rg completed outside of the territories licensed by roche  and to fund our other operations 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials  and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization  and number of our clinical trials and other research and development programs  the amount of revenues we receive under our existing collaboration agreement and any future collaboration agreements  the costs of the development and expansion of our operational infrastructure  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates  the ability of our collaborators to achieve development milestones  marketing approval  and other events or developments under our current and future collaboration agreements  the costs of filing  prosecuting  enforcing  and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production  the costs of establishing sales and marketing capabilities or contracting with third parties to provide these capabilities for us  the costs of acquiring or undertaking development and commercialization efforts for any future product candidates  the magnitude of our general and administrative expenses  and any costs that we may incur under current and future licensing arrangements relating to our product candidates 

table of contents until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through payments received under our collaborations  debt or equity financings  or by out licensing product candidates 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
contractual obligations and commitments we entered into an operating lease for office and laboratory space located in princeton  new jersey through may  the annual occupancy expense under this lease is approximately  we also entered into an operating lease for office space located in durham  north carolina through april the annual occupancy expense under this lease is approximately  we executed three secured promissory notes totaling million  million in october  million in march  and million in december the secured promissory notes require payments of interest only for the first months followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest

under our license agreement with emory university for racivir  we agreed to pay emory university up to an aggregate of million in future marketing milestone payments 
off balance sheet transactions to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ substantially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of 
table of contents the notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  however  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when all of the following four criteria are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets  the elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborator and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units either on the basis of each unit s fair value or using the residual method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
our revenues are primarily related to our collaboration agreement with roche 
this agreement provides for various types of payments to us  including non refundable upfront license fees  research and development payments  and milestone payments 
where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaboration agreement  non refundable upfront license payments received upon contract signing are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as the related activities are performed 
the period over which these activities are to be performed is based upon our estimate of the development period 
changes in our estimate could change the period over which revenues are recognized 
research and or development payments are recognized as revenues as the related research and or development activities are performed and when we have no continuing performance obligations related to the research and development payment received 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments when earned  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii we do not have ongoing performance obligations related to the achievement of the milestone earned 
milestone payments are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payment is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
any amounts received under the agreements in advance of performance  if deemed substantive  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 
where we have no continuing involvement under a collaborative arrangement  we record nonrefundable license fee revenues when we have the contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement  and records milestones upon appropriate notification to us of achievement of the milestones by the collaborative partner 
deferred revenue associated with a non refundable payment received under a collaborative agreement that is terminated prior to its completion results in an immediate recognition of the deferred revenues 
accrued expenses we are required to estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements 
this process involves estimating the level of service performed on our behalf and the associated cost incurred in instances where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs 
examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development  clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials 
we account for expenses 
table of contents associated with these external services by determining the total cost of a given study based on the terms of the related contract 
we accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials and the invoices received from our external service providers 
in the case of clinical trials  the estimated cost normally relates to the projected costs of having subjects enrolled in our trials  which we recognize over the estimated term of the trial according to the number of patients enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis  beginning with patient enrollment 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  the number of clinical trials and related research service agreements has been relatively limited and our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
we expect  however  as clinical trials for psi  psi  and psi advance  that our estimated accruals for clinical and research services will be more material to our operations in future periods 
stock based compensation we recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and directors based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
the grant date fair value of the award is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the equity instruments issued 
equity instruments granted to consultants are periodically valued and recorded as stock compensation expense as the equity instrument vests

 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our excess cash in high quality  interest bearing securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid mutual and money market funds  and high quality marketable debt instruments of corporations  government agencies and financial institutions with maturities of less than two years 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on september   this change would not have had a material effect on future earnings  cash flows or the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date 
in addition  our secured promissory notes have fixed interest rates of or 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have entered into some agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in foreign currencies  and  in the future  we may enter into additional  agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
if the values of these currencies increase against the united states dollar  our costs would increase 
to date  we have not entered into any contracts to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the future  depending upon the amounts payable under any such agreements  we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs 
however  due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under any such agreements  foreign exchange contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results
