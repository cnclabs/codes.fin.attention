progress energy introduction our reportable business segments are pec and pef  and their primary operations are the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina and south carolina and in portions of florida  respectively 
the corporate and other segment primarily includes the operations of the parent  progress energy service company  llc pesc and other miscellaneous nonregulated businesses corporate and other that do not separately meet the quantitative requirements as a separate reportable business segment 
strategy we are an integrated energy company primarily focused on the end use electricity markets 
we own two electric utilities that operate in regulated retail utility markets in north carolina  south carolina and florida and have access to attractive wholesale markets in the eastern united states 
the utilities have more than  megawatts mw of regulated electric generation capacity and serve approximately million retail electric customers as well as other load serving entities 
please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
we have a strong track record of meeting our financial commitments and delivering operational excellence 
we have maintained liquidity and financial stability and sustained our dividend rate during the current economic downturn  and we believe that we have good prospects for growth once the economy begins to recover 
an improving national economy may lead to greater mobility for homeowners around the country and a return of migration to the southeast region that is more consistent with historical levels 
the utility industry  as a whole  however  faces significant cost pressures and  in the near term  lower retail electricity sales 
in addition  current economic conditions and anticipated higher expenditures including for environmental compliance  renewable energy standards compliance and new generation and transmission facilities may subject us to an even higher level of scrutiny from regulators and lead to a more uncertain regulatory environment 
we anticipate the need to prepare for a different kind of energy future one that would include  among other things  reducing carbon emissions and using emerging technologies such as the smart grid and electric vehicles 
we believe that our balanced solution strategy provides an effective  flexible framework to prepare for this new energy future 
additional information about the strategy  including updates on implementation  is included in strategic initiatives below 
to manage the challenges of the present and prepare for the future  management s priority focus areas for and beyond are as follows financial performance operational performance organizational effectiveness regulation and public policy strategic initiatives the first two priorities are core elements of managing our business 
the next two priorities will help enable what we can accomplish in the future 
the last priority involves making the right investments to create a strong energy future for progress energy and our customers 
financial and operational performance effectively managing expenses  deploying capital and enhancing our margin are critical to achieving sustainable earnings growth and attractive long term returns for our shareholders 
we have instituted throughout our organization systematic approaches to achieve sustainable cost savings through enhanced efficiency and productivity 
these ongoing cost management initiatives along with short term expense management have enabled us to offset some of the impact of the economic downturn and cost pressures and should yield long term operations and maintenance o m expense savings and effective capital management 
also  we recognize that our shareholders strongly value our dividend and that it is an integral part of our total shareholder return proposition 
our long term goal is to achieve a to percent dividend payout ratio  and we are committed to managing the company such that we reach this target while maintaining an attractive  sustainable dividend rate 
our financial performance depends on the successful operation of the utilities electric generating and distribution facilities and reliable delivery of electric service to our customers 
consequently  we strive to excel in safety  operational performance and customer satisfaction 
we also focus on rigorous project management in executing our capital program  including large scale capital projects such as construction of new generating facilities  modernization of existing facilities and environmental compliance as well as programs such as demand side management dsm 
another operational priority is a fleet alignment initiative to strengthen the utilities nuclear performance in safely and reliably producing electricity while meeting the highest standards of environmental protection in the most efficient manner 
the multi year initiative implements a new business model for our five nuclear units and is based on industry benchmarking that coordinated  collaborative and standardized operations achieves and sustains a higher level of performance than would be possible if each unit operated autonomously 
the goals of the initiative are  among other things  to establish a common vision and set of core values  facilitate common procedures across the fleet to accommodate shared resources and industry best practices  and establish a strong performance monitoring system that provides feedback to management 
organizational effectiveness with our managers and supervisors at all levels  we emphasize demonstrating the leadership behaviors that fully engage our workforce and optimize their performance in executing our strategy 
we strive to cultivate an inclusive work environment in which we treat everyone with respect and hold each other to high standards 
in addition  we are implementing long term workforce strategies to prepare for our changing needs and an aging workforce 
our workforce strategy includes recruiting  training and retaining a skilled  diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve 
regulation and public policy pec and pef are regulated by the state utility commissions in their state jurisdictions 
our regulatory strategy is based on filing reasonable rate requests designed to provide recovery of prudent expenses and a fair return on utility investments 
our business plans include the assumption that the respective public utility commissions will provide reasonable recovery 
in  pec received approval for its coal to gas fleet modernization plan discussed in strategic initiatives as well as multiple dsm  renewable energy and energy efficiency filings 
also in  pef successfully sought interim and limited rate relief and nuclear cost recovery in florida 
however  in response to a base rate case pef filed with the florida public service commission fpsc  in january  the fpsc decided to grant pef no increase in base rates above what was previously awarded in for the repowered bartow plant approximately million annual revenue requirements 
the fpsc s decision was predicated on its desire to hold down rates 
however  we believe the pef revenue level approved in january is inadequate given our current costs of providing customers with reliable service  anticipated costs to responsibly prepare for their future energy needs and pef s right by law to a reasonable opportunity to recover its operating costs and return on invested capital 
we are currently reviewing our regulatory options in florida 
we believe that the fpsc s regulatory action was strongly influenced by the current economic downturn 
in a long term view of florida s regulatory environment  we believe that as the economy improves  the need to provide for florida s energy future will have a stronger influence in the fpsc s decision making process 
consequently  we do not believe the january decision represents a permanent change to the regulatory environment in florida 
we are subject to significant federal and state regulations regarding air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes  and other environmental matters 
changes in federal and state regulation are currently under consideration for  among others  greenhouse gases ghg such as carbon dioxide co  coal combustion products  mercury and particulate matter 
with the state  federal and international focus on global climate change  we are preparing for a carbon constrained future and are actively engaged in helping shape effective policies to address the issue 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by some proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
the cost impact of legislation or regulation to address global climate change would depend on the specific legislation or regulation enacted and cannot be determined at this time 
however  we anticipate that it could result in significant rate increases over time to recover the compliance costs 
we are dedicated to seeking achievable  affordable climate and energy policies 
we evaluate public policy proposals and actively promote initiatives that are achievable but manage the long term costs to our customers 
strategic initiatives our balanced solution strategy is intended to deploy capital effectively to meet future customer needs and emerging public policies while achieving our financial objectives 
it is a three pronged strategy that focuses on energy efficiency  alternative energy and state of the art power generation 
expenditures to achieve our balanced solution should be recoverable under base rates or cost recovery mechanisms implemented by our state jurisdictions 
updates on our implementation of this strategy are discussed below 
first  we are expanding and enhancing our dsm  energy efficiency and energy conservation programs 
we have implemented expanded energy efficiency programs to our customers and continue to pursue additional initiatives 
federal law enacted in contains provisions promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy and we have been notified of our selection for smart grid grant negotiations 
second  we are actively engaged in a variety of alternative energy projects 
we have executed contracts to purchase approximately mw of electricity generated from solar  biomass and municipal solid waste sources 
while this currently represents a small percentage of our total capacity  we will continue to pursue additional contracts for these and other alternative energy sources 
third  we are evaluating new generation and fleet upgrades to meet the anticipated demand at both pec and pef toward the end of the next decade 
we are evaluating modernization of existing coal plants and the best new generation options  including advanced design nuclear technology and gas fired combined cycle and combustion turbines 
in  we completed the repowering of pef s bartow plant  construction of a new mw combustion turbine at pec and the installation of pollution control equipment or scrubbers on pef s coal fired unit  crystal river unit no 
cr  and pec s mayo plant 
we also received approval to construct a mw combined cycle dual fuel facility and a mw combined cycle natural gas fueled facility at pec  which are expected to come online in and  respectively 
pec has filed for approval to construct a mw natural gas fueled facility 
in  we also announced our intention to embark on a major coal to gas fleet modernization in north carolina by retiring approximately  mw of older coal fired units by the end of and building combined cycle gas 
this will provide rate base growth while reducing our carbon emissions 
while we have not made a final determination on nuclear construction  we have taken steps to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
in  the utilities each filed a combined license col application with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for two additional reactors each at shearon harris nuclear plant harris and at a greenfield site in levy county  florida levy 
we have focused on levy given the need for more fuel diversity in florida and anticipated federal and state policies to reduce ghg emissions  as well as existing state legislative policy that is supportive of nuclear projects 
pef has received two of the three key approvals with the issuance of a col remaining and entered into an engineering  procurement and construction epc agreement for the two proposed levy units 
in light of a regulatory schedule shift and other factors  our anticipated capital expenditures for levy will be significantly less in the near term than previously planned 
later in  pef will file its annual nuclear cost recovery filing with the fpsc  which will reflect our latest plan with respect to levy 
in summary  we are effectively dealing with today s challenges while taking steps to create long term value for our customers and shareholders 
results of operations in this section  we provide analysis and discussion of earnings and the factors affecting earnings on both a gaap and non gaap basis 
we introduce our results of operations in an overview section followed by a more detailed analysis and discussion by business segment 
a reconciliation of ongoing earnings to gaap net income attributable to controlling interests is below  followed by an explanation of our non gaap financial measurement  ongoing earnings 
for the year ended december  in millions  except per share data pec pef corporate and other total per share ongoing earnings cvo mark to market impairment  net of tax a plant retirement charge  net of tax a cumulative prior period adjustment related to certain employee life insurance benefits  net of tax a discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax net income loss attributable to controlling interests b for the year ended december  in millions  except per share data pec pef corporate and other total per share ongoing earnings valuation allowance and related net operating loss carry forward discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax net income loss attributable to controlling interests b for the year ended december  in millions  except per share data pec pef corporate and other total per share ongoing earnings cvo mark to market discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax net income loss attributable to controlling interests b a calculated using assumed tax rate of percent 
b net income attributable to controlling interests is shown net of preferred stock dividend requirement of million and million at pec and pef  respectively 
management uses the non gaap financial measure ongoing earnings i as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends  ii as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations  iii as a measure for determining levels of incentive compensation  and iv in communications with our board of directors  employees  shareholders  analysts and investors concerning our financial performance 
management believes this non gaap measure is appropriate for understanding the business and assessing our potential future performance  because excluded items are limited to those that management believes are not representative of our fundamental core earnings 
we compute ongoing earnings as gaap net income attributable to controlling interests after excluding discontinued operations and the effects of certain identified gains and charges 
some of the excluded gains and charges have occurred in more than one reporting period but are not considered representative of fundamental core earnings 
historically  ongoing earnings for our reportable segments  which are pec and pef  have been consistent with the most comparable gaap measure  net income attributable to controlling interests 
in  pec recorded charges that management determined should be excluded from pec s ongoing earnings 
the charges were related to its planned retirement of certain coal fired generating units prior to the end of their useful lives and a cumulative prior period adjustment related to certain employee life insurance benefits 
the prior period adjustment  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of  is not material to previously issued or current period financial statements 
ongoing earnings is not a measure calculated in accordance with gaap  and should be viewed as a supplement to  and not a substitute for  our results of operations presented in accordance with gaap 
overview for as compared to and as compared to for the year ended december   our net income attributable to controlling interests was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the same period in the decrease as compared to prior year was due primarily to unfavorable impact of discontinued non utility businesses ongoing earnings adjustment  unfavorable net retail customer growth and usage at the utilities  higher interest expense  and higher base depreciation and amortization at the utilities 
partially offsetting these items were net impact of returns earned on higher levels of nuclear and environmental cost recovery clause ecrc assets at pef  favorable impact of interim and limited base rate relief at pef  depreciation and amortization expense recognized in at pec related to north carolina clean smokestacks act clean smokestacks act amortization expense and depreciation expense associated with the accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets  and favorable weather at the utilities 
for the year ended december   our net income attributable to controlling interests was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the same period in the increase in as compared to was due primarily to favorable impact of discontinued non utility businesses ongoing earnings adjustment  favorable allowance for funds used during construction afudc at the utilities  increased retail base rates at pef  higher wholesale revenues at pef  lower purchased power capacity costs at pec due to the expiration of a power buyback agreement  and favorable net retail customer growth and usage at pec 
partially offsetting these items were higher interest expense at pef  higher income tax expense due to the benefit from the closure of certain federal tax years and positions in  unfavorable net retail customer growth and usage at pef  unfavorable weather at pec  higher investment losses of certain employee benefit trusts at pef and corporate and other resulting from the decline in market conditions  and higher depreciation and amortization expense at pef excluding prior year recoverable storm amortization at pef 
progress energy carolinas pec contributed net income available to parent totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income available to parent for as compared to was primarily due to unfavorable net retail customer growth and usage  coal plant retirement charges  higher base depreciation and amortization expense and a cumulative prior period adjustment related to certain employee life insurance benefits  partially offset by clean smokestacks act amortization and depreciation expense associated with the accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets recognized in and the favorable impact of weather 
pec contributed ongoing earnings of million in there were no ongoing earnings adjustments in and the ongoing earnings adjustments to net income available to parent were due to pec recording a million charge  net of tax  for the impact of pec s decision to retire certain coal fired generating units prior to the end of their estimated useful lives and recording a million charge  net of tax  for a cumulative prior period adjustment related to certain employee life insurance benefits 
management does not consider these charges to be representative of pec s fundamental core earnings and excluded these charges in computing pec s ongoing earnings 
the increase in net income available to parent for as compared to was primarily due to lower purchased power capacity costs due to the expiration of a power buyback agreement  favorable afudc and favorable net retail customer growth and usage  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of weather and lower excess generation revenues 
the revenue tables that follow present the total amount and percentage change of total operating revenues and its components 
base revenues is a non gaap measure and is defined as operating revenues excluding clause recoverable regulatory returns  miscellaneous revenues and fuel and other pass through revenues 
we and pec consider base revenues a useful measure to evaluate pec s electric operations because fuel and other pass through revenues primarily represent the recovery of fuel  applicable portions of purchased power expenses and other pass through expenses through cost recovery clauses and  therefore  do not have a material impact on earnings 
clause recoverable regulatory returns include the return on asset component of dsm  energy efficiency and renewable energy clause revenues 
we and pec have included the reconciliation and analysis that follows as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with gaap 
revenues a reconciliation of base revenues to gaap operating revenues  including the percentage change by year and by customer class  follows in millions customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental unbilled total retail base revenues wholesale base revenues total base revenues clause recoverable regulatory returns miscellaneous fuel and other pass through revenues total operating revenues pec s total retail base revenues were billion and billion for and  respectively 
the million decrease in revenues was due primarily to the million unfavorable impact of net retail customer growth and usage  partially offset by the million favorable impact of weather 
the unfavorable impact of net retail customer growth and usage was driven by a decrease in the average usage per retail customer  partially offset by a net  increase in the average number of customers for compared to however  pec s rate of residential growth has declined as pec s average number of customers increased a net  customers for compared to the favorable impact of weather was driven by higher heating and cooling degree days than of percent and percent  respectively 
additionally  cooling degree days were percent higher than normal in pec s miscellaneous revenues increased million in primarily due to higher transmission revenues 
pec s total retail base revenues were billion and billion for and  respectively 
the million increase in revenues was due primarily to the million favorable impact of net retail customer growth and usage  partially offset by the million unfavorable impact of weather 
the favorable net retail customer growth and usage was driven by a net  increase in the average number of customers for compared to  partially offset by lower average usage per retail customer 
weather had an unfavorable impact as cooling degree days were percent lower than  even though cooling degree days were comparable to normal 
pec s wholesale base revenues were million and million for and  respectively 
the million lower wholesale base revenues were driven by million lower excess generation sales due to unfavorable market dynamics due to higher relative fuel costs and million lower revenues related to capacity contracts with two major customers 
pec s electric energy sales in kilowatt hours kwh and the percentage change by year and by customer class were as follows in millions of kwh customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental unbilled total retail kwh sales wholesale total kwh sales the decrease in retail kwh sales in was primarily due to a decrease in average usage per retail customer 
pec s industrial kwh sales have decreased percent from  primarily due to continued reductions in textile manufacturing in the carolinas as a result of global competition and domestic consolidation as well as a continued downturn in the lumber and building materials segment as a result of declines in construction 
many of the manufacturers in pec s service territory have been adversely impacted by the economic conditions  and we expect a relatively slow recovery in industrial sales once the economy begins to recover 
wholesale kwh sales decreased for primarily due to decreased excess generation sales resulting from unfavorable market dynamics 
industrial electric energy sales decreased in compared to  primarily due to downturns in textile manufacturing and lumber and building materials segment as previously discussed 
pec has experienced a decline in its retail and wholesale kwh sales due to the economic conditions in the united states 
we cannot predict how long these conditions may last or the extent to which they may impact revenues 
in the future  pec s customer usage could be impacted by customer response to energy efficiency programs and to increased rates 
expenses fuel and purchased power fuel and purchased power costs represent the costs of generation  which include fuel purchases for generation  as well as energy purchased in the market to meet customer load 
fuel and applicable portions of purchased power expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  and  as such  changes in these expenses do not have a material impact on earnings 
the difference between fuel and purchased power costs incurred and associated fuel revenues that are subject to recovery is deferred for future collection from or refund to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to fuel used in electric generation increased million to billion primarily due to million higher deferred fuel expense and the million net impact of higher fuel costs 
the increase in deferred fuel expense was primarily due to the implementation of new fuel rates in north carolina 
the higher fuel costs were primarily due to higher coal prices 
purchased power expense decreased million to million compared to prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower market purchases of million and lower co generation of million primarily due to lower system requirements 
see pec fuel and purchased power in item  business  for a summary of average fuel costs 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion for  which represents a million increase compared to purchased power expense increased million to million compared to the increase was primarily due to increased economical purchases in of million  partially offset by the million impact from the expiration of a power buyback agreement with north carolina eastern municipal power agency power agency 
fuel used in electric generation decreased million to billion primarily due to a million decrease in deferred fuel expense  partially offset by increased fuel costs of million 
the decrease in deferred fuel expense was primarily driven by a million impact from the implementation of state legislation that expanded the definition of the traditional fuel clause to include costs of commodities such as ammonia and limestone used in emissions control technologies reagents  transmission charges and non capacity related costs of purchases and a million impact related to under recovered fuel costs 
deferred fuel expense was higher in primarily due to the collection of fuel costs from customers that had been previously under recovered 
the increase in fuel costs of million was primarily due to an increase in coal prices  partially offset by the impacts of lower system requirements and a change in the generation mix 
operation and maintenance o m expense was billion for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase was primarily due to coal plant retirement charges of million  higher pension and benefit costs of million and storm costs of million  partially offset by lower emission allowance expense of million resulting from lower system requirements  changes in generation mix and sales of nitrogen oxide nox allowances 
pec recognized coal plant retirement charges million  net of tax for the impact of the decision to retire coal fired units prior to the end of their useful lives see future liquidity and capital resources pec other matters and other matters energy demand 
management determined that such charges should be an exclusion from pec s ongoing earnings 
o m expense was billion for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase was driven primarily by a million increase in nuclear expenses  of which million relates to refurbishments  preventive maintenance and incremental outage expenses at brunswick nuclear plant brunswick 
additionally  o m increased due to a million increase in estimated environmental remediation expenses see note a  partially offset by million lower employee benefits and million lower nuclear plant outage and maintenance costs 
the decrease in employee benefits was primarily due to the impact from changes in stock based compensation plans and higher relative employee incentive goal achievement 
the decrease in nuclear plant outage and maintenance costs was primarily due to two nuclear refueling and maintenance outages in compared to three in depreciation  amortization and accretion depreciation  amortization and accretion expense was million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to the million of depreciation associated with the accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets recognized during see note b and the million of clean smokestacks act amortization recognized in  partially offset by the million impact of depreciable asset base increases 
the north carolina jurisdictional aggregate minimum amount of accelerated cost recovery has been met  and the south carolina jurisdictional obligation was terminated by the public service commission of south carolina scpsc 
pec does not anticipate recording additional accelerated depreciation in the north carolina jurisdiction  but will record depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with a regulatory order  pec ceased to amortize clean smokestacks act compliance costs  but will record depreciation over the useful lives of the assets see note b 
depreciation  amortization and accretion expense was million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to million lower clean smokestacks act amortization  million lower gridsouth transco  llc gridsouth amortization and million lower storm deferral amortization  partially offset by million higher depreciation associated with the accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets and the million impact of depreciable asset base increases 
taxes other than on income taxes other than on income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in gross receipts taxes due to higher operating revenues and higher property tax rates 
gross receipts taxes are collected from customers and recorded as revenues and then remitted to the applicable taxing authority 
therefore  these taxes have no material impact on earnings 
total other income  net total other income  net was million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease was primarily due to a cumulative prior period adjustment related to certain employee life insurance benefits and lower interest income resulting from lower average eligible deferred fuel balances 
during the fourth quarter of  pec recorded a cumulative prior period adjustment related to certain employee life insurance benefits 
the impact of this adjustment decreased total other income  net by million and decreased net income available to parent by million 
the prior period adjustment is not material to previously issued or current period financial statements 
management determined that the adjustment should be an exclusion from pec s ongoing earnings 
total other income  net was million for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase was primarily due to million favorable afudc equity related to eligibility of certain clean smokestacks act compliance costs and other increased eligible construction project costs  partially offset by million lower interest income resulting from lower average eligible deferred fuel balances and lower temporary investment balances 
total interest charges  net total interest charges  net was million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on variable rate debt  partially offset by higher interest as a result of higher average debt outstanding 
total interest charges  net was million for  which represents a million decrease compared to this decrease was primarily due to the million favorable afudc debt related to eligibility of certain clean smokestacks act compliance costs and other increased eligible construction project costs and the million impact of a decrease in average long term debt  offset by an million interest benefit resulting from the resolution of tax matters in income tax expense income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million income tax expense decrease in compared to was primarily due to the impact of lower pre tax income and the million favorable tax benefit related to a deduction triggered by the transfer of previously funded amounts from nonqualified nuclear decommissioning trusts ndts to qualified ndts 
the million income tax expense increase in compared to was primarily due to the million impact of higher pre tax income and the million impact related to the deduction for domestic production activities  partially offset by the million tax impact of employee stock based benefits and the million impact of the increase in afudc equity previously discussed 
afudc equity is excluded from the calculation of income tax expense 
progress energy florida pef contributed net income available to parent and ongoing earnings totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net income available to parent for as compared to was primarily due to the higher net impact of returns earned on higher levels of nuclear and ecrc assets to be recovered through respective cost recovery clauses  the favorable impact of interim and limited base rate relief see note c and the favorable impact of weather  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of retail customer growth and usage  higher base depreciation and amortization expense  and higher o m 
the increase in net income available to parent for as compared to was primarily due to favorable afudc  increased retail base rates and higher wholesale revenues  partially offset by higher interest expense  unfavorable net retail customer growth and usage  higher depreciation and amortization expense excluding recoverable storm amortization  and higher investment losses of certain employee benefit trusts

as a result of an fpsc regulatory order effective in january  pef is allowed to earn returns on certain costs related to nuclear construction  as discussed in note c 
we anticipate higher returns on ecrc assets in due to placing approximately million of clean air interstate rule cair projects into service in late however  we do not anticipate a significant change in returns on nuclear cost recovery assets in related to levy 
pef s total retail base revenues were billion and billion for and  respectively 
the million increase was primarily due to million of base rate increases  partially offset by the million impact of unfavorable net retail customer growth and usage 
the increase in base rates was due to million from hines being placed in service and the million transfer of hines cost recovery from the fuel clause to base rates 
these base rate changes occurred in accordance with pef s base rate settlement agreement 
pef s wholesale base revenues of million and million for and  respectively  increased million 
the increase was primarily due to several new and amended contracts 
pef s electric energy sales and the percentage change by year and by customer class were as follows in millions of kwh customer class change change residential commercial industrial governmental unbilled total retail kwh sales wholesale total kwh sales wholesale base revenues increased in  despite decreased wholesale kwh sales in  primarily due to committed capacity revenues 
the wholesale kwh sales decreased primarily due to market conditions in which wholesale customers fulfilled a portion of their system requirements from other sources 
many of the new and amended capacity contracts entered into in expired by the end of given the current economic conditions discussed below  pef does not believe it is likely to replace these wholesale contracts in retail base revenues increased in  despite a decrease in kwh sales for the same period  primarily due to the impact of interim and limited base rate relief approved by the fpsc in see note c 
retail base revenues increased in  despite a decrease in kwh sales for the same period  primarily due to an increase in base rates in accordance with pef s base rate settlement agreement  as previously discussed 
the economic conditions and general housing downturn in the united states has continued to contribute to a slowdown in customer growth and usage in pef s service territory resulting in a percent decrease in retail kwh sales for  compared to  and a percent decrease for  compared to the impact of the general housing downturn was especially severe in several states  including florida 
additionally  we believe the current economic conditions have impacted our wholesale customers usage

the decrease in current year fuel costs was primarily due to lower system requirements 
purchased power expense decreased million compared to the same period in  primarily due to million lower interchange costs and a decrease in the recovery of deferred capacity costs of million  both resulting from lower system requirements 
see pef fuel and purchased power in item  business  for a summary of average fuel costs 
fuel and purchased power expenses were billion in  which represents an million decrease compared to fuel used in electric generation decreased million to billion primarily due to a million decrease in deferred fuel expense  partially offset by increased fuel costs of million 
the decrease in deferred fuel expense was primarily due to the regulatory approval to lower the fuel factor for customers effective january as a result of over recovery of fuel costs in the prior year 
with the increase in fuel prices experienced in  pef successfully sought a mid course fuel correction  but the revised fuel factors were not effective until august the increase in fuel costs was primarily due to increased fuel prices and a change in generation mix 
purchased power expense increased million to million compared to this increase was primarily due to increased purchases of million as a result of higher fuel costs and an increase in the recovery of deferred capacity costs of million 
operation and maintenance o m expense was million in  which represents a million increase compared to the increase was primarily due to million higher ecrc and energy conservation cost recovery clause eccr costs primarily due to an increase in current year rates for recovery of emission allowances  higher pension costs of million and higher nuclear plant outage and maintenance costs of million  partially offset by lower storm cost recovery of million due to the surcharge that ended in july and the impact of a change in our earned vacation policy of million 
the ecrc and eccr expenses and replenishment of storm damage reserve are recovered through cost recovery clauses and  therefore  have no material impact on earnings 
pension costs are higher due to a million pension credit in the prior year 
substantially all of s pension expense has been deferred in accordance with an fpsc order see note c 
in the aggregate  o m expenses recoverable through base rates increased million compared to the same period in o m expense was million in  which represents a million decrease compared to the decrease was primarily due to million lower ecrc costs due to a decrease in the rates resulting from over recovery  million lower employee benefit costs primarily due to the impact from changes in stock based compensation plans and million lower sales and use tax audit adjustment  partially offset by million related to storm damage reserves replenishment surcharge in effect august through july in accordance with a regulatory order  and million higher plant outage and maintenance costs 
the ecrc and replenishment of storm damage reserves expenses are recovered through cost recovery clauses and  therefore  have no material impact on earnings 
in the aggregate  o m expenses recoverable through base rates decreased million compared to the same period in depreciation  amortization and accretion depreciation  amortization and accretion expense was million for  which represented an increase of million compared to  primarily due to higher nuclear cost recovery amortization of million see note c 
in aggregate  depreciation  amortization and accretion expenses recoverable through base rates increased million compared to  primarily due to depreciable asset base increases 
depreciation  amortization and accretion expense was million for  which represented a decrease of million compared to  primarily due to million lower amortization of unrecovered storm restoration costs and a million write off in of leasehold improvements primarily related to vacated office space  partially offset by the million impact of depreciable asset base increases 
storm restoration costs  which were fully amortized in august  were recovered through a storm recovery surcharge and  therefore  had no material impact on earnings see note c 
in aggregate  depreciation  amortization and accretion expenses recoverable through base rates increased million compared to  primarily due to depreciable asset base increases 
taxes other than on income taxes other than on income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in gross receipts and franchise taxes due to higher operating revenues 
gross receipts and franchise taxes are collected from customers and recorded as revenues and then remitted to the applicable taxing authority 
therefore  these taxes have no material impact on earnings 
other other operating expense was an expense of million in  income of million in and an expense of million in the million expense in and the million expense in were primarily due to regulatory disallowances of fuel costs see note c 
the million income in was primarily due to gain on land sales 
total other income  net total other income  net was million for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase was primarily due to the million of investment gains on certain employee benefit trusts resulting from improved market conditions  partially offset by million lower interest income resulting from lower short term investment balances and million unfavorable afudc equity related to eligible construction project costs  primarily due to placing the repowered bartow plant into service in total other income  net was million for  which represents a million increase compared to this increase was primarily due to million favorable afudc equity related to eligible construction project costs  partially offset by million of investment losses of certain employee benefit trusts resulting from the decline in market conditions 
total interest charges  net total interest charges  net was million in  which represents an increase of million compared to the increase in interest charges was primarily due to higher interest as a result of higher average debt outstanding 
total interest charges  net was million in  which represents an increase of million compared to the increase in interest charges was primarily due to the million impact of an increase in average long term debt  partially offset by million favorable afudc debt related to costs associated with eligible construction projects and million interest benefit resulting from the resolution of tax matters in income tax expense income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million income tax expense increase in compared to was primarily due to the million impact of higher pre tax income compared to the prior year  partially offset by the million impact of the favorable tax benefit related to a deduction triggered by the transfer of previously funded amounts from the nonqualified ndt fund to the qualified ndt fund 
the million income tax expense increase in compared to was primarily due to the million impact of higher pre tax income compared to  million benefit related to the closure of certain federal tax years and positions in  million due to the accelerated amortization of tax related regulatory assets in accordance with pef s base rate settlement agreement  and million related to the deduction for domestic production activities  partially offset by the million impact of favorable afudc equity discussed above 
afudc equity is excluded from the calculation of income tax expense 
corporate and other the corporate and other segment primarily includes the operations of the parent  pesc and other miscellaneous nonregulated businesses that do not separately meet the quantitative disclosure requirements as a reportable business segment

cvo mark to market progress energy issued million cvos in connection with the acquisition of florida progress corporation florida progress in each cvo represents the right of the holder to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuels facilities purchased by subsidiaries of florida progress in october the payments are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate see note 
the cvos had a fair value of million at december   and million at december  and progress energy recorded unrealized gains of million for and unrealized losses of million for  to record the changes in fair value of the cvos  which had average unit prices of at december  and at december  and valuation allowance and related net operating loss carry forward we previously recorded a deferred tax asset for a state net operating loss carry forward upon the sale of progress energy ventures  inc s pvi nonregulated generation facilities and energy marketing and trading operations 
in  we recorded an additional million deferred tax asset related to the state net operating loss carry forward due to a change in estimate based on tax return filings 
we also evaluated the total state net operating loss carry forward and recorded a partial valuation allowance of million  which more than offset the change in estimate 
impairment in  progress energy recorded impairments of certain investments of our affordable housing portfolio 
discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax we completed our business strategy of divesting of nonregulated businesses to reduce our business risk and focus on core operations of the utilities 
see note for additional information related to discontinued operations 
in  we recognized million of expense from discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax  which was primarily due to a jury delivering a verdict in a lawsuit against progress energy and a number of our subsidiaries and affiliates previously engaged in coal based solid synthetic fuels operations 
as a result  we recorded an after tax charge of million to discontinued operations in  which was net of a previously recorded indemnification liability 
the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in further adjustments 
see note d for additional information 
during we recognized million of income from discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax  which was comprised primarily of million after tax gains on sales of our coal terminals and docks in west virginia and kentucky terminals and our remaining coal mining businesses 
in  we recognized million of expense from discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax  which was comprised primarily of million net losses related to the exit of the competitive commercial operations cco business  partially offset by million net earnings related to the terminals and synthetic fuels businesses 
the net losses from the cco business were primarily due to the million after tax charge associated with exit costs  partially offset by unrealized mark to market gains related to de designated natural gas hedges 
we had substantial operations associated with the production of coal based solid synthetic fuels 
the production and sale of these products qualified for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements were satisfied 
as a result of the expiration of the tax credit program  all of our synthetic fuels businesses were abandoned and all operations ceased as of december  application of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in doing so  we made certain estimates that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant accounting policies and estimates that may have a material impact on our financial results and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and corporate performance committee audit committee of our board of directors 
impact of utility regulation our regulated utilities segments are subject to regulation that sets the prices rates we are permitted to charge customers based on the costs that regulatory agencies determine we are permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by a nonregulated company 
the application of gaap for regulated operations to this ratemaking process results in deferral of expense recognition and the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows 
as a result of the different ratemaking processes in each state in which we operate  a significant amount of regulatory assets has been recorded 
we continually review these regulatory assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
additionally  the state regulatory agencies ratemaking processes often provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of the regulatory assets 
our conclusion that we and the utilities meet the criteria to apply gaap for regulated operations is a material assumption in the presentation and evaluation of our and the utilities financial position and results of operations 
the utilities ability to continue to meet the criteria for application of gaap for regulated operations could be affected in the future by actions of our regulators  competitive forces and restructuring in the electric utility industry 
state regulators may not allow the utilities to increase future retail rates required to recover their operating costs or provide an adequate return on investment  or in the manner requested 
state regulators may also seek to reduce or freeze retail rates 
such events occurring over a sustained period could result in the utilities no longer meeting the criteria for the continued application of gaap for regulated operations 
in the event that gaap for regulated operations no longer applies to one or both of the utilities  we are subject to the risk that regulatory assets and liabilities would be eliminated and utility plant assets may be impaired  unless an appropriate recovery mechanism was provided 
additionally  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
see note for additional information related to the impact of utility regulation on our operations 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist 
if an impairment indicator exists  the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value to the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group 
if the asset group is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows or if the asset group is to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group 
our exposure to potential impairment losses for utility plant  net is mitigated by the fact that our regulated ratemaking process generally allows for recovery of our investment in utility plant plus an allowed return on the investment  as long as the costs are prudently incurred 
the carrying values of our total utility plant  net at december were as follows in millions progress energy pec pef as discussed in note  our financial assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of derivative financial instruments and marketable debt and equity securities held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts 
substantially all unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and all unrealized gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning trust investments are deferred as regulatory liabilities or assets consistent with ratemaking treatment 
therefore  the impact of fair value measurements from recurring financial assets and liabilities on our or the utilities earnings is not significant 
asset retirement obligations asset retirement obligations aros represent legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain tangible long lived assets 
the present values of retirement costs for which we have a legal obligation are recorded as liabilities with an equivalent amount added to the asset cost and depreciated over the useful life of the associated asset 
the liability is then accreted over time by applying an interest method of allocation to the liability 
aros have no impact on the income of the utilities as the effects are offset by the establishment of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
progress energy s  pec s and pef s total aros at december   were billion  million  and million  respectively 
we calculated the present value of our aros based on estimates which are dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimated retirement costs  the timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount and cost escalation rates 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time and are subject to change 
these changes could materially affect the aros  although changes in such estimates should not affect earnings  because these costs are expected to be recovered through rates 
nuclear decommissioning aros represent percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of progress energy s  pec s and pef s total aros at december  to determine nuclear decommissioning aros  we utilize periodic site specific cost studies in order to estimate the nature  cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for our nuclear plants 
our regulators require updated cost estimates for nuclear decommissioning every five years 
these cost studies are subject to change based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  cost escalation  changes in technology applicable to nuclear decommissioning and changes in federal  state or local regulations 
changes in pec s and pef s nuclear decommissioning site specific cost estimates or the use of alternative cost escalation or discount rates could be material to the nuclear decommissioning liabilities recognized 
pec obtained updated cost studies for its nuclear plants in  using cost factors 
if the site specific cost estimates increased by percent  pec s aros would have increased by million 
if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  pec s aros would have increased by million 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate of basis points would have decreased pec s aros by million 
pef obtained an updated cost study for its nuclear plant in  using cost factors 
if the site specific cost estimates increased by percent  pef s aros would have increased by million 
if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  pef s aros would have increased by million 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate of basis points would have decreased pef s aros by million 
goodwill as discussed in note  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
all of our goodwill is allocated to our utility segments and our goodwill impairment tests are performed at the utility segment level 
the carrying amounts of goodwill at december  and  for reportable segments pec and pef  were billion and billion  respectively 
we perform our annual impairment tests as of april each year 
during the second quarter of  we completed the annual tests  which indicated the goodwill was not impaired 
if the fair value of pec had been lower by percent and the fair value of pef had been lower by percent  there still would be no impact on the reported value of their goodwill 
we calculate the fair value of our utility segments by considering various factors  including valuation studies based primarily on income and market approaches 
more emphasis is applied to the income approach as substantially all of the utility segments cash flows are from rate regulated operations 
in such environments  revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs  sales volumes and costs of capital 
accordingly  the utility segments operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects  positive or negative  of significant swings in market or economic conditions 
the income approach uses discounted cash flow analyses to determine the fair value of the utility segments 
the estimated future cash flows from operations are based on the utility segments business plans  which reflect management s assumptions related to customer usage based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party sources 
the business plans assume the occurrence of certain events in the future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of returns on equity  the timing of anticipated significant future capital investments  the anticipated earnings and returns related to such capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts 
management also determines the appropriate discount rate for the utility segments based on the weighted average cost of capital for each utility  which takes into account both the cost of equity and pre tax cost of debt 
as each utility segment has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations  the discount rate for each reporting unit may differ 
the market approach uses implied market multiples derived from comparable peer utilities and market transactions to estimate the fair value of the utility segments 
peer utilities are evaluated based on percentage of revenues generated by regulated utility operations  percentage of revenues generated by electric operations  generation mix  including coal  gas  nuclear and other resources  market capitalization as of the valuation date  and geographic location 
comparable market transactions are evaluated based on the availability of financial transaction data and the nature and geographic location of the businesses or assets acquired  including whether the target company had a significant electric component 
the selection of comparable peer utilities and market transactions  as well as the appropriate multiples from within a reasonable range  is a matter of professional judgment 
the calculations in both the income and market approaches are highly dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimate of future cash flows  the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates from a marketplace participant s perspective  and the selection of peer utilities and marketplace transactions for comparative valuation purposes 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time 
if these assumptions change or should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  the fair value of the utility segments could be significantly different in future periods  which could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the utility segments  we compared their combined fair value estimate to progress energy s market capitalization as of april  the analysis confirmed that the fair values were reasonably representative of market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization 
we monitor for events or circumstances  including financial market conditions and economic factors  that may indicate an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary 
we would perform an interim impairment test should any events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a utility segment below its carrying value 
unbilled revenue as discussed in note  we recognize electric utility revenues as service is rendered to customers 
operating revenues included unbilled electric utilities base revenues earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period 
the determination of electricity sales to individual customers is based on meter readings  which occur on a systematic basis through the month 
at the end of each month  electricity delivered to customers since the last meter reading is estimated and a corresponding accrual for the electric utility revenues associated with unbilled sales is recognized 
unbilled revenues are estimated by applying a weighted average revenue kwh for all customer classes to the number of estimated kwh delivered but not billed 
the calculation of unbilled revenue is affected by factors that include fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period  seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns  price in effect for each customer class and estimated transmission and distribution line losses 
amounts recorded as receivables on the balance sheets at december related to unbilled revenues were as follows in millions progress energy pec pef income taxes judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax related assets and liabilities 
as discussed in note  deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented  if necessary  to realize deferred tax assets 
we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all  or a portion of  a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty 
ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax related assets and liabilities could be material 
in accordance with gaap  the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes is accounted for by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
a two step process is required recognition of the tax benefit based on a more likely than not threshold  and measurement of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
pension costs as discussed in note a  we maintain qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement pension plans 
we also have supplementary defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits to higher level employees 
our reported costs are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  such costs are impacted by employee demographics  changes made to plan provisions  actual plan asset returns and key actuarial assumptions  such as expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used in determining benefit obligations and annual costs 
due to a slight decrease in the market interest rates for high quality aaa aa debt securities  which are used as the benchmark for setting the discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefit payments  we decreased the discount rate to at december   from at december   which will increase pension costs  all other factors remaining constant 
our discount rates are selected based on a plan by plan study  which matches our projected benefit payments to a high quality corporate yield curve 
consistent with general market conditions  our plan assets performed well in with returns of approximately 
that positive asset performance will result in decreased pension costs in  all other factors remaining constant 
in addition  contributions to pension plan assets in late and will result in decreased pension costs in due to increased asset balances  all other factors remaining constant 
evaluations of the effects of these and other factors on our pension costs have not been completed  but we estimate that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million before the million deferral  see notes c and a recognized in we have pension plan assets with a fair value of approximately billion at december  our expected rate of return on pension plan assets is 
the expected rate of return used in pension cost recognition is a long term rate of return  therefore  we do not adjust that rate of return frequently 
in  we lowered the expected rate of return from the previously used  due primarily to the uncertainties resulting from the severe capital market deterioration in a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pension costs by approximately million 
another factor affecting our pension costs  and sensitivity of the costs to plan asset performance  is the method selected to determine the market related value of assets  ie  the asset value to which the expected long term rate of return is applied 
entities may use either fair value or an averaging method that recognizes changes in fair value over a period not to exceed five years  with the method selected applied on a consistent basis from year to year 
we have historically used a five year averaging method 
when we acquired florida progress in  we retained the florida progress historical use of fair value to determine market related value for florida progress pension assets 
changes in plan asset performance are reflected in pension costs sooner under the fair value method than the five year averaging method  and  therefore  pension costs tend to be more volatile using the fair value method 
approximately percent of our pension plan assets are subject to each of the two methods 
since pec and pef participate in our pension plans  the general discussion above applies to pec and pef 
pec and pef have not completed evaluating their pension costs 
pec estimates that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million recognized in a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pec s pension costs by approximately million 
pef estimates that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million before million deferral  see note a recognized in a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pef s pension costs by approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources overview our significant cash requirements arise primarily from the capital intensive nature of the utilities operations  including expenditures for environmental compliance 
we rely upon our operating cash flow  substantially all of which is generated by the utilities  commercial paper and bank facilities  and our ability to access the long term debt and equity capital markets for sources of liquidity 
as discussed in future liquidity and capital resources below  synthetic fuels tax credits provide an additional source of liquidity as those credits are realized 
the majority of our operating costs are related to the utilities 
most of these costs are recovered from ratepayers in accordance with various rate plans 
we are allowed to recover certain fuel  purchased power and other costs incurred by pec and pef through their respective recovery clauses 
the types of costs recovered through clauses vary by jurisdiction 
fuel price volatility can lead to over or under recovery of fuel costs  as changes in fuel prices are not immediately reflected in fuel surcharges due to regulatory lag in setting the surcharges 
as a result  fuel price volatility can be both a source of and a use of liquidity resources  depending on what phase of the cycle of price volatility we are experiencing 
changes in the utilities fuel and purchased power costs may affect the timing of cash flows  but not materially affect net income 
as a registered holding company  our establishment of intercompany extensions of credit is subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
our subsidiaries participate in internal money pools  administered by pesc  to more effectively utilize cash resources and reduce external short term borrowings 
the utility money pool allows the utilities to lend to and borrow from each other 
a non utility money pool allows our nonregulated operations to lend to and borrow from each other 
the parent can lend money to the utility and non utility money pools but cannot borrow funds 
the parent is a holding company and  as such  has no revenue generating operations of its own 
the primary cash needs at the parent level are our common stock dividend  interest and principal payments on the parent s billion of senior unsecured debt and potentially funding the utilities capital expenditures through equity contributions 
the parent s ability to meet these needs is typically funded with dividends from the utilities generated from their earnings and cash flows  and to a lesser extent  dividends from other subsidiaries  repayment of funds due to the parent by its subsidiaries  the parent s bank facility  and or the parent s ability to access the short term and long term debt and equity capital markets 
in recent years  rather than paying dividends to the parent  the utilities  to a large extent  have retained their free cash flow to fund their capital expenditures 
during  pec paid a dividend of million to the parent and pef received equity contributions of million from the parent 
pec and pef expect to pay dividends to the parent in there are a number of factors that impact the utilities decision or ability to pay dividends to the parent or to seek equity contributions from the parent  including capital expenditure decisions and the timing of recovery of fuel and other pass through costs 
therefore  we cannot predict the level of dividends or equity contributions between the utilities and the parent from year to year 
the parent could change its existing common stock dividend policy based upon these and other business factors 
cash from operations  commercial paper issuance  borrowings under our credit facilities  long term debt financings  and or limited ongoing sales of common stock from our progress energy investor plus plan ipp  employee benefit and stock option plans are expected to fund capital expenditures  long term debt maturities and common stock dividends for for the fiscal year  we plan  subject to market conditions  to realize up to million from the sale of stock through ongoing equity sales 
as discussed further in credit rating matters  and in item a  risk factors  our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms may be negatively impacted by recent  and potentially future  rating actions 
we have financial institutions that support our combined billion revolving credit facilities for the parent  pec and pef  thereby limiting our dependence on any one institution 
the credit facilities serve as back ups to our commercial paper programs 
to the extent amounts are reserved for commercial paper or letters of credit outstanding  they are not available for additional borrowings 
at december   the parent had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility  an outstanding commercial paper balance of million and had issued million of letters of credit  which were supported by the revolving credit facility 
at december   pec and pef had no outstanding commercial paper 
based on these outstanding amounts at december   there was billion available for additional borrowings 
subsequent to december   the parent repaid all of its outstanding commercial paper with proceeds from the million november issuance of senior notes 
borrowings under our revolving credit agreement rca during  which were repaid during  coupled with commercial paper  long term debt and equity issuances in  provided liquidity during a period of uncertain financial market conditions 
we will continue to monitor the credit markets to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
at december   pec and pef had limited counterparty mark to market exposure for financial commodity hedges primarily gas and oil hedges due to spreading our concentration risk over a number of counterparties 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the exposure in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
at december   the majority of the utilities open financial commodity hedges were in net mark to market liability positions 
see note a for additional information with regard to our commodity derivatives 
at december   we had limited mark to market exposure to certain financial institutions under pay fixed forward starting swaps to hedge cash flow risk with regard to future financing transactions for each of the parent  pec and pef 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the exposure in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
at december   the sum of the parent s  pec s and pef s open pay fixed forward starting swaps was each in a net mark to market asset position 
see note b for additional information with regard to our interest rate derivatives 
our pension trust funds and nuclear decommissioning trust funds are managed by a number of financial institutions  and the assets being managed are diversified in order to limit concentration risk in any one institution or business sector 
we believe our internal and external liquidity resources will be sufficient to fund our current business plans 
risk factors associated with credit facilities and credit ratings are discussed below and in item a  risk factors 
the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis 
historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations net cash provided by operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and a portion of capital expenditures 
the utilities produced substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for increased when compared with the billion increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million increase in the recovery of deferred fuel costs due to higher fuel rates and million of cash collateral paid to counterparties on derivative contracts in compared to million net refunds of cash collateral in these impacts were partially offset by million of pension and other benefits contributions made in net cash provided by operating activities for decreased when compared with the million decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million decrease in the recovery of fuel costs due to the under recovery driven by rising fuel costs  compared to an over recovery of fuel costs during the corresponding period in  million of cash collateral paid to counterparties on derivative contracts in compared to million in net refunds of cash collateral in  primarily at pef  and a million increase in inventory purchases  primarily coal  driven by higher prices 
these impacts were partially offset by a million increase from accounts receivable  primarily related to our divested cco operations and former synthetic fuels businesses  the million payment made in to exit the contract portfolio consisting of full requirements contracts with georgia electric membership cooperatives formerly serviced by cco the georgia contracts see note c  a million increase from accounts payable  and a million increase from income taxes  net 
the increase from accounts receivable was primarily driven by the settlement of million of derivative receivables related to derivative contracts for our former synthetic fuels businesses see note a 
the increase from income taxes  net was largely due to million in income tax payments made in related to the sale of natural gas drilling and production business  partially offset by income tax impacts at pec 
the change in accounts payable was primarily related to our divested operations 
in  and  the utilities filed requests with their respective state commissions seeking rate increases for fuel cost recovery  including amounts for previous under recoveries 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
property additions at the utilities  including nuclear fuel  were billion and billion in and  respectively  or approximately percent of consolidated capital expenditures in both and capital expenditures at the utilities are primarily for capacity expansion and normal construction activity and ongoing capital expenditures related to environmental compliance programs 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested of million in and million in  cash used in investing activities decreased by million 
the decrease in was primarily due to a million decrease in gross property additions at the utilities  primarily due to lower spending for environmental compliance projects and the completion of pef s bartow plant repowering project in  a million decrease in nuclear fuel additions  and a million decrease in net purchases of available for sale securities and other investments 
available for sale securities and other investments include marketable debt securities and investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested of million in and million in  cash used in investing activities increased by million 
the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in gross property additions at the utilities  primarily at pef  and a million decrease in net purchases of available for sale securities and other investments

future liquidity and capital resources please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
the utilities produced substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations for the years ended december   and we anticipate that the utilities will continue to produce substantially all of the consolidated cash flows from operations over the next several years 
our discontinued synthetic fuels operations historically produced significant net earnings from the generation of tax credits see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits 
a portion of these tax credits has yet to be realized in cash due to the difference in timing of when tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes and realized for tax purposes 
at december   we have carried forward million of deferred tax credits 
realization of these tax credits is dependent upon our future taxable income  which is expected to be generated primarily by the utilities 
we expect to be able to meet our future liquidity needs through cash from operations  commercial paper issuance  availability under our credit facilities  long term debt financings and equity offerings 
we may also use periodic ongoing sales of common stock from our ipp and employee benefit and stock option plans to meet our liquidity requirements 
we issue commercial paper to meet short term liquidity needs 
as a result of financial and economic conditions in and  the short term credit markets tightened  resulting in volatility in commercial paper durations and interest rates 
the parent borrowed million under its rca in november and repaid the outstanding balance during with proceeds from the january equity issuance  cash on hand and proceeds from commercial paper borrowings 
if liquidity conditions deteriorate again and negatively impact the commercial paper market  we will need to evaluate other  potentially more expensive  options for meeting our short term liquidity needs  which may include borrowing under our rca  issuing short term notes  issuing long term debt and or issuing equity 
if our short term credit ratings are downgraded below tier a p f  we could experience increased volatility in commercial paper durations and interest rates and our access to the commercial paper markets could be negatively impacted 
in the event of a downgrade of our senior unsecured credit ratings  our credit facility fees and borrowing rates under our rca s could increase 
we do not expect an increase in such rca fees to be material 
see credit rating matters for further discussion regarding credit ratings 
the current rcas for the parent  pec and pef expire in may  june and march  respectively 
we are currently evaluating options for addressing these upcoming expirations 
in the event we enter into new credit facilities  we cannot predict the terms  prices  durations or participants in such facilities 
progress energy and its subsidiaries have approximately billion in outstanding long term debt 
currently  approximately million of the utilities debt obligations  approximately million at pec and approximately million at pef  are tax exempt auction rate securities insured by bond insurance 
these tax exempt bonds have experienced and continue to experience failed auctions 
assuming the failed auctions persist  future interest rate resets on our tax exempt auction rate bond portfolio will be dependent on the volatility experienced in the indices that dictate our interest rate resets and or rating agency actions that may move our tax exempt bonds below a a 
pec s senior secured debt ratings are currently a by moody s investors service  inc moody s and a watch negative by standard and poor s rating services s p 
pef s senior secured debt ratings are currently a watch negative by moody s and a watch negative by s p 
in the event of a one notch downgrade of pec s and or pef s senior secured debt rating by s p  the ratings of both utilities tax exempt bonds would be below a  most likely resulting in higher future interest rate resets 
in the event of a one notch downgrade by moody s  pec s and pef s tax exempt bonds will continue to be rated above a we will continue to monitor this market and evaluate options to mitigate our exposure to future volatility 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plans 
although a number of factors impact our pension funding requirements  a decline in the market value of these assets may significantly increase the future funding requirements of the obligations under our defined benefit pension plans 
we expect to make at least million of contributions directly to pension plan assets in see note 
as discussed in strategy  liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures  and in other matters environmental matters  over the long term  compliance with environmental regulations and meeting the anticipated load growth at the utilities as described under other matters increasing energy demand will require the utilities to make significant capital investments 
these anticipated capital investments are expected to be funded through a combination of cash from operations and issuance of long term debt  preferred stock and or common equity  which are dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets 
we may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
as discussed in other matters nuclear potential new construction  pef expects its capital expenditures for the levy project will be significantly less in the near term than previously planned in light of a regulatory schedule shift and other factors 
certain of our hedge agreements may result in the receipt of  or posting of  derivative collateral with our counterparties  depending on the daily derivative position 
fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to our return of collateral received and or our posting of collateral with our counterparties negatively impact our liquidity 
substantially all derivative commodity instrument positions are subject to retail regulatory treatment 
after settlement of the derivatives and consumption of the fuel  any realized gains or losses are passed through the fuel cost recovery clause 
changes in natural gas prices and settlements of financial hedge agreements since december   have impacted the amount of collateral posted with counterparties 
at february   we had posted approximately million of cash collateral compared to million of cash collateral posted at december  the majority of our financial hedge agreements will settle in and additional commodity market price decreases could result in significant increases in the derivative collateral that we are required to post with counterparties 
we continually monitor our derivative positions in relation to market price activity 
in addition  as discussed in credit rating matters  if our credit ratings are downgraded  we may have to post additional cash collateral for derivatives in a liability position 
the amount and timing of future sales of debt and equity securities will depend on market conditions  operating cash flow and our specific needs 
we may from time to time sell securities beyond the amount immediately needed to meet capital requirements in order to allow for the early redemption of long term debt  the redemption of preferred stock  the reduction of short term debt or for other corporate purposes 
at december   the current portion of our long term debt was million 
on january   we funded the million series a floating rate notes maturity with proceeds from the parent s november million long term debt issuance  and we expect to fund the remaining million with a combination of cash from operations  commercial paper borrowings and long term debt

regulatory matters and recovery of costs regulatory matters  including nuclear cost recovery  as discussed in note and other matters regulatory environment  and filings for recovery of environmental costs  as discussed in note and in other matters environmental matters  may impact our future liquidity and financing activities 
the impacts of these matters  including the timing of recoveries from ratepayers  can be both a source of and a use of future liquidity resources 
regulatory developments expected to have a material impact on our liquidity are discussed below 
as discussed further in note and in other matters regulatory environment  the north carolina  south carolina and florida legislatures passed energy legislation that became law in recent years 
these laws may impact our liquidity over the long term  including  among others  provisions regarding cost recovery  mandated renewable portfolio standards  dsm and energy efficiency 
pec cost recovery clause on may   pec filed with the scpsc for a decrease in the fuel rate charged to its south carolina ratepayers 
on june   the scpsc approved a settlement agreement filed jointly by pec and the south carolina office of regulatory staff and nucor steel 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the parties agreed to pec s proposed rate reduction of approximately million  which went into effect july  on june   pec filed with the north carolina utilities commission ncuc for a decrease in the fuel rate charged to its north carolina ratepayers 
the filing was updated on august  pec asked the ncuc to approve a million decrease in the fuel rates driven by declining fuel prices  which went into effect december  at december   pec s north carolina deferred fuel balance was million  of which million is expected to be collected after pec other matters on october   the ncuc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity allowing pec to proceed with plans to construct an approximately mw combined cycle dual fuel capable generating facility at its richmond county generation site to provide additional generating and transmission capacity to meet the growing energy demands of southern and eastern north carolina 
pec expects that the new generating and transmission capacity will be online by the second quarter of as discussed in note and in other matters environmental matters  on october   the ncuc issued an order granting pec a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a mw combined cycle natural gas fueled electric generating facility at a site in wayne county  nc  to replace three coal fired generating units at the site that have a combined generating capacity of approximately mw 
we intend to continue to depreciate the three coal fired units at their current depreciation rate until pec s next depreciation study 
pec projects that the generating facility would be in service by january the filed estimate of capital expenditures  net of afudc borrowed funds for the new generating facility is approximately million 
pec modified its clean smokestacks act compliance plan for the change in fuel source and removed retrofitting pec s sutton plant with emission reduction technology from the plan 
accordingly  pec filed a revised estimate with the ncuc  which decreased estimated capital expenditures to meet the clean smokestacks act emission targets by to billion from billion 
we are continuing to evaluate various design  technology  generation and fuel options  including retiring some coal fired plants that could change expenditures required to maintain compliance with the clean smokestacks act limits subsequent to in accordance with the october ncuc order  pec filed with the ncuc a plan to retire no later than december   all of its coal fired generating facilities in north carolina that do not have scrubbers 
we intend to continue to depreciate the coal fired units at their current depreciation rate until pec s next depreciation study 
on december   pec filed with the ncuc an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a mw combined cycle natural gas fueled electric generating facility at a site in new hanover county  nc the filed estimate of capital expenditures  net of afudc borrowed funds for the new generating facility is approximately million 
pec projects that the generating facility would be in service by late or early pef base rates as a result of a base rate proceeding in  pef was party to a base rate settlement agreement that was effective with the first billing cycle of january and remained in effect through the last billing cycle of december on march   in anticipation of the expiration of its current base rate settlement agreement  pef filed with the fpsc a proposal for an increase in base rates effective january  in its filing  pef requested the fpsc to approve calendar year as the projected test period for setting new base rates and approve annual rate relief for pef of million  which included pef s petition for a combined million of new base rates in as discussed below 
the request for increased base rates was based  in part  on investments pef is making in its generating fleet and in its transmission and distribution systems 
included within the base rate proposal was a request for an interim base rate increase of million 
additionally  on march   pef petitioned the fpsc for a limited proceeding to include in base rates revenue requirements of million for the repowered bartow plant  which began commercial operations in june on may   the fpsc approved both the annualized interim base rate increase and the cost recovery for the repowered bartow plant subject to refund with interest effective july  the interim and limited base rate relief increased revenues by million during the year ended december on january   the fpsc approved a base rate increase of million effective january   which represents the annualized impact of the rate increase that was approved and effective july for the repowered bartow plant 
additionally  the fpsc did not require pef to refund the interim base rate increase previously discussed 
the difference between pef s requested million incremental revenues and the million granted by the fpsc is a function of several factors  including  among other things pef had proposed rates based on a return on equity of percent and the fpsc granted rates based on a return on equity of percent  the fpsc granted rates based on projected annual depreciation expense that is approximately million lower than the amount requested by pef  and the fpsc s ruling incorporates projected annual o m costs that are approximately million lower than the o m cost requested by pef and the elimination of million of annual storm reserve accrual  which represented a million increase over the accrual previously in effect 
we are currently reviewing our regulatory options 
pef cost recovery clauses on march   pef received approval from the fpsc to reduce its fuel cost recovery factors by an amount sufficient to achieve a million reduction in fuel charges to retail customers as a result of effective fuel purchasing strategies and lower fuel prices 
the approval reduced customers fuel charges starting with the first billing cycle of april on september   pef filed a request with the fpsc to seek approval of a cost adjustment to reduce fuel costs by million  thereby decreasing residential electric bills by per  kwh  or percent  effective january  on october   pef filed a million cost adjustment with the fpsc  which reduced the capacity cost recovery clause ccrc rate by per  kwh from the original september  cost adjustment filing 
the fpsc approved pef s fuel and capacity clause filings on november   to be effective january  in addition  on august  and as updated on october   pef filed a request to increase the ecrc residential rate 
also  on september   pef filed a request to increase the eccr residential rate 
the fpsc approved a combined million increase in pef s ecrc and eccr clauses on november   to be effective january  pef has received approval from the fpsc for recovery through the ecrc of the majority of costs associated with the remediation of distribution and substation transformers 
the fpsc has approved cost recovery of pef s prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve its integrated strategy to address compliance with cair  the clean air mercury rule camr and the clean air visibility rule cavr through the ecrc see other matters environmental matters for discussion regarding the cair  camr and cavr 
nuclear cost recovery pef is allowed to recover prudently incurred site selection costs  preconstruction costs and the carrying cost on construction cost balances on an annual basis through the ccrc 
such amounts will not be included in pef s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
the nuclear cost recovery rule also has a provision to recover costs should the project be abandoned after the utility receives a final order granting a determination of need 
these costs include any unrecovered construction work in progress at the time of abandonment and any other prudent and reasonable exit costs 
in addition  the rule requires the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
on november   the fpsc issued a final order approving the recovery of prudently incurred nuclear costs through the ccrc  and found that pef s project management  contracting  and oversight controls were reasonable and prudent 
as discussed in note  on october   the fpsc clarified certain implementation policies related to the recognition of deferrals and the application of carrying charges under the nuclear cost recovery rule 
on march   pef received approval from the fpsc to defer until the recovery of million of nuclear preconstruction costs for levy  which the fpsc had authorized to be collected in the approval reduced customers nuclear cost recovery charge starting with the first billing cycle of april on may   pursuant to the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule  pef filed a petition to recover million through the ccrc  which primarily consists of preconstruction and carrying costs incurred or anticipated to be incurred during and the projected costs associated with the levy and cr uprate projects 
in an effort to help mitigate the initial price impact on its customers  as part of its filing  pef proposed collecting certain costs over a five year period  with associated carrying costs on the unrecovered balance 
this alternate proposal reduced the revenue requirement to million 
on september   consistent with fpsc rules  pef included both proposed revenue requirements in its ccrc filing 
at a special agenda hearing by the fpsc on october   the fpsc approved the alternate proposal allowing pef to recover million through the nuclear cost recovery clause of the ccrc beginning with the first billing cycle of january the remainder  with minor adjustments  will also be recovered through the ccrc 
in adopting pef s proposed rate plan for  the fpsc permitted pef to annually reconsider changes to the recovery of deferred amounts to afford greater flexibility to manage future rate impacts 
capital expenditures total cash from operations and proceeds from long term debt and equity issuances provided the funding for our capital expenditures  including environmental compliance and other utility property additions  nuclear fuel expenditures and non utility property additions during as shown in the table that follows  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be incurred at our regulated operations 
we expect to fund our capital requirements primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt  preferred stock and or common equity 
in addition  we have billion in credit facilities that support the issuance of commercial paper

these ratings reflect the current views of these rating agencies  and no assurances can be given that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
however  we monitor our financial condition as well as market conditions that could ultimately affect our credit ratings 
on august   moody s raised the senior secured debt rating of both pec and pef to a from a as a result of moody s reevaluating its notching criteria for investment grade regulated utilities to reflect the historical lower default rates for regulated utilities than for non financial  non utility corporate issuers

as noted above  the three rating agencies cited increased regulatory risk and pef s rate case outcome as the key driver of the ratings actions 
credit rating changes could be made after the agencies have completed their reviews of pef s rate order and our response to the decision 
credit rating downgrades could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and respond to major events such as hurricanes 
our cost of capital could also be higher  which could ultimately increase prices for our customers 
it is important for us to maintain our credit ratings and have access to the capital markets in order to reliably serve customers  invest in capital improvements and prepare for our customer s future energy needs see item a  risk factors

market risk and derivatives under our risk management policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
contractual obligations we are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating us to make cash payments in future years 
these contracts include financial arrangements such as debt agreements and leases  as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services 
in most cases  these contracts contain provisions for price adjustments  minimum purchase levels and other financial commitments 
the commitment amounts presented in the following table are estimates and therefore will likely differ from actual purchase amounts 
further disclosure regarding our contractual obligations is included in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we take into consideration the future commitments when assessing our liquidity and future financing needs 
the following table reflects progress energy s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december   in the respective periods in which they are due in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt a see note interest payments on long term debt b capital lease obligations c see note b operating leases c see note b fuel and purchased power d see note a other purchase obligations e see note a minimum pension funding requirements f other postretirement benefits g see note a uncertain tax positions h see note other commitments i total a our maturing debt obligations are generally expected to be repaid with cash from operations or refinanced with new debt issuances in the capital markets 
b interest payments on long term debt are based on the interest rate effective at december  c amounts include certain related executory cost commitments 
d essentially all fuel and certain purchased power costs incurred by the utilities are recovered through cost recovery clauses in accordance with state and federal regulations and therefore do not require separate liquidity support 
e amounts primarily relate to an epc agreement that pef entered into in december for two nuclear units planned for construction at levy 
the contractual obligations presented are in accordance with the existing terms of the epc agreement  which assumes the original construction schedule and percent ownership by pef 
actual payments under the epc agreement are dependent upon  and may vary significantly based upon  the decision to build  regulatory approval schedules  timing and escalation of project costs  and the percentages  if any  of joint ownership 
because of anticipated schedule shifts  we are negotiating an amendment to the epc agreement see discussion under other matters nuclear potential new construction 
we cannot currently predict the impact such amendment might have on the amount and timing of pef s contractual obligations 
if levy is deferred or cancelled  pef may incur contract suspension  termination and or exit costs 
the magnitude of these contract suspension  termination and exit costs cannot be determined at this time and  accordingly  are not reflected in this table 
f represents the projected minimum required contributions to the qualified pension trusts for a total of years 
these amounts are subject to change significantly based on factors such as pension asset earnings and market interest rates 
g represents projected benefit payments for a total of years related to our postretirement health and life plans 
these amounts are subject to change based on factors such as experienced claims and general health care cost trends 
h uncertain tax positions of million are not reflected in this table as we cannot predict when open income tax years will be closed with completed examinations 
it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to approximately million during the month period ending december   due to expected settlements 
i by ncuc order  in  pec began transitioning north carolina jurisdictional amounts currently retained internally to its external decommissioning funds 
the transition of the original million must be complete by december   and at least percent must be transitioned each year 
other matters regulatory environment the utilities operations in north carolina  south carolina and florida are regulated by the ncuc  the scpsc and the fpsc  respectively 
the utilities are also subject to regulation by the ferc  the nrc and other federal and state agencies common to the utility business 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions  as well as the rate of return the utilities are permitted to earn  are subject to the approval of one or more of these governmental agencies 
to our knowledge  there is currently no enacted or proposed legislation in north carolina  south carolina or florida that would give retail ratepayers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry 
we cannot anticipate when  or if  any of these states will move to increase retail competition in the electric industry 
the american recovery and reinvestment act  signed into law in february contains provisions promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy  including billion in smart grid technology development grants  million for smart grid storage  monitoring and technology viability  billion for energy efficiency and conservation grants and billion in tax credits for the purchase of plug in electric vehicles 
in august  we submitted our application to the united states department of energy doe for million in federal matching infrastructure funds in support of our investment in smart grid related technologies in the carolinas and florida 
on october   the doe notified us of our selection for smart grid award negotiations 
we are now awaiting further questions and comments from the doe on our smart grid application 
the submission of an application and the notification for award negotiations are not a commitment to accept federal funds but are necessary steps to keep the option open 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of the law and assessing the conditions imposed by participation in the incentive programs 
also  the obama administration has announced a goal of encouraging investment in transmission and promoting renewable resources while also pricing ghg emissions and setting a federal requirement for renewable energy 
on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of this bill would establish a national cap and trade program to reduce ghg emissions as well as a national renewable energy portfolio standard reps 
the bill also calls for investment in the electric grid  more production and utilization of electric vehicles and improvements in energy efficiency in buildings and appliances 
the full impact of the legislation  if enacted into law  cannot be determined at this time and will depend upon changes made to its provisions during the legislative process and the manner in which key provisions are implemented  including the regulation of carbon 
the us senate is considering similar proposals 
the full impact of final legislation  if enacted  and additional regulation resulting from these and other federal ghg initiatives cannot be determined at this time  however  we anticipate that it could result in significant cost increases over time  for which the utilities would seek corresponding rate recovery 
current retail rate matters affected by state regulatory authorities are discussed in notes b and c 
this discussion identifies specific retail rate matters  the status of the issues and the associated effects on our consolidated financial statements 
on july   the governor of north carolina signed into law a bill that includes three key provisions that may impact pec 
first  the legislation accelerates the certification process for a public utility to construct a new natural gas plant as long as the public utility permanently retires the existing coal unit at that specific site 
pursuant to the legislation  pec requested and received approval from the ncuc to pursue construction of a new mw natural gas plant see further discussion in note b and other matters environmental matters 
second  a recovery mechanism is provided for utilities if they invest in zero emissions renewable energy facilities within the next five years 
finally  the legislation changes the state s dam safety act such that dams at utility coal fired power plants  including dams for ash ponds  will be subject to the act s applicable provisions  including state inspection as of january  florida energy law enacted in includes provisions that would  among other things  help enhance the ability to cost effectively site transmission lines  require the fpsc to develop a renewable portfolio standard that the fpsc would present to the legislature for ratification in  direct the florida department of environmental protection fdep to develop rules establishing a cap and trade program to regulate ghg emissions that the fdep would present to the legislature no earlier than january for ratification by the legislature  and establish a new florida energy and climate commission as the principal governmental body to develop energy and climate policy for the state and to make recommendations to the governor and legislature on energy and climate issues 
in complying with the provisions of the law  pef would be able to recover its reasonable prudent compliance costs 
however  until these agency actions are finalized  we cannot predict the costs of complying with the law 
on july   the governor of florida issued executive orders to address reduction of ghg emissions 
the executive orders call for the first southeastern state cap and trade program and include adoption of a maximum allowable emissions level of ghgs for florida utilities 
the standard will require  at a minimum  the following three reduction milestones by  emissions not greater than year utility sector emissions  by  emissions not greater than year utility sector emissions  and by  emissions not greater than percent of year utility sector emissions 
to date  the fdep has held three rulemaking workshops on the ghg cap and trade rulemaking 
rulemaking is expected to continue through  and the rule requires legislative ratification before implementation 
the executive orders also requested that the fpsc initiate a rulemaking by september   that would require florida utilities to produce at least percent of their electricity from renewable sources  reduce the cost of connecting solar and other renewable energy technologies to florida s power grid by adopting uniform statewide interconnection standards for all utilities  and authorize a uniform  statewide method to enable residential and commercial customers who generate electricity from onsite renewable technologies of up to mw in capacity to offset their consumption over a billing period by allowing their electric meters to turn backward when they generate electricity net metering 
on january   the fpsc approved a draft florida renewable portfolio standard rule with a goal of percent renewable energy production by the fpsc provided the draft florida renewable portfolio standard rule to the florida legislature in february  but the legislature did not take action in the session 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
we cannot predict the costs of complying with the laws and regulations that may ultimately result from these executive orders 
our balanced solution  as described in energy demand  includes greater investment in energy efficiency  renewable energy and state of the art generation and demonstrates our commitment to environmental responsibility 
north carolina energy law enacted in includes provisions for a north carolina renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio standard nc reps  expansion of the definition of the traditional fuel clause and recovery of the costs of new dsm and energy efficiency programs through an annual dsm clause 
on february   the ncuc issued an order adopting final rules for implementing north carolina s energy law 
the rules include filing requirements regarding nc reps compliance and inclusion in the utility s integrated resource plan 
the order also establishes a schedule and filing requirements for dsm and energy efficiency cost recovery and financial incentives 
rates for the dsm and energy efficiency clause and the nc reps clause will be set based on projected costs with true up provisions 
pec has implemented a series of dsm and energy efficiency programs and will continue to pursue additional programs 
these programs must be approved by the ncuc  and we cannot predict the outcome of filings currently pending approval by the ncuc or whether the implemented programs will produce the expected operational and economic results 
energy demand implementing state and federal energy policies  promoting environmental stewardship and providing reliable electricity to meet the anticipated long term growth within the utilities service territories will require a balanced approach 
the three main elements of this balanced solution are expanding our energy efficiency programs  investing in the development of alternative energy resources for the future  and operating state of the art plants that produce energy cleanly and efficiently by modernizing existing plants and pursuing options for building new plants and associated transmission facilities 
we are actively pursuing expansion of our dsm  energy efficiency and conservation programs because energy efficiency is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy costs  offset the need for new power plants and protect the environment 
dsm programs include programs and initiatives that shift the timing of electricity use from peak to nonpeak periods  such as load management  electricity system and operating controls  direct load control  interruptible load  and electric system equipment and operating controls 
we provide our residential customers with home energy audits and offer energy efficiency programs that provide incentives for customers to implement measures that reduce energy use 
for business customers  we also provide energy audits and other tools  including an interactive internet web site with online calculators  programs and efficiency tips  to help them reduce their energy use 
we are actively engaged in a variety of alternative energy projects to pursue the generation of electricity from swine waste and other plant or animal sources  biomass  solar  hydrogen  and landfill gas technologies 
among our projects  we have executed contracts to purchase approximately mw of electricity generated from biomass and up to mw of electricity generated from municipal solid waste sources 
the majority of these projects should be online within the next five years 
in addition  we have executed purchased power agreements for approximately mw of electricity generated from solar photovoltaic generation as part of the nc reps 
the majority of these projects are online and the remainder should be online by early additionally  customers across our service territory have connected approximately mw of solar photovoltaic energy systems to our grid 
in june  we expanded our solar energy strategy to include a range of new solar incentives and programs  which are expected to increase our use of solar energy by more than mw over the next decade 
in the coming years  we will continue to invest in existing plants and consider plans for building new generating plants 
due to the anticipated long term growth in our service territories  we estimate that we will require new generation facilities in both florida and the carolinas toward the end of the next decade  and we are evaluating the best available options for this generation  including advanced design nuclear and gas technologies 
at this time  no definitive decisions have been made to construct new nuclear plants 
in  pec announced a coal to gas modernization strategy whereby the remaining coal fired generating facilities in north carolina that do not have scrubbers would be retired prior to the end of their useful lives and their approximately  mw of generating capacity replaced with new natural gas fueled facilities 
the coal fired units will be retired by the end of pec has received approval from the ncuc for construction of a mw natural gas fueled generating facility at a site in wayne county  nc  to be placed in service in january pec has requested approval from the ncuc to construct a mw natural gas fueled generating facility at a site in new hanover county  nc the facility is projected to be placed in service in late or early pec will continue to operate three coal fired plants in north carolina after pec has invested more than billion in installing state of the art emission controls at the roxboro  mayo and asheville plants 
emissions of nox  so  mercury and other pollutants have been reduced significantly at those sites 
as authorized under the energy policy act of epact  on october   the doe published final regulations for the disbursement of up to billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects using innovative technologies 
the guarantees  which will cover up to percent of the amount of any loan for no more than percent of the project cost  are expected to spur development of nuclear  clean coal and ethanol projects 
in  congress authorized billion in loan guarantee authority for innovative energy projects 
of the total provided  billion is set aside for nuclear power facilities  billion for advanced nuclear facilities for the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle  billion for renewable and or energy efficient systems and manufacturing and distributed energy generation transmission and distribution  billion for coal based power generation and industrial gasification at retrofitted and new facilities that incorporate carbon capture and sequestration or other beneficial uses of carbon  and billion for advanced coal gasification 
in june  the doe announced solicitations for a total of up to billion of the amount authorized by congress in federal loan guarantees for projects that employ advanced energy technologies that avoid  reduce or sequester air pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions and advanced nuclear facilities for the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle 
pef submitted part i of the application for federal loan guarantees for nuclear power facilities on september   for levy 
pef was one of applicants that submitted part i of the application 
the program requires that the guarantee be in a first lien position on all assets of the project  which conflicts with pef s current mortgage 
obtaining the required approval to amend the current mortgage from percent of pef s current bondholders would be unlikely  and current secured debt of billion would need to be refinanced with unsecured debt to meet the requirements of the guarantee 
in addition  the costs associated with obtaining the loan guarantee are unclear 
pef decided not to pursue the loan guarantee program and did not submit part ii of the application  which was due on december  however  this decision does not preclude pef from revisiting the program at a later date if there are changes to the program 
we cannot predict if pef will pursue this program further 
a new nuclear plant may be eligible for the federal production tax credits and risk insurance provided by epact 
epact provides an annual tax credit of cents per kwh for nuclear facilities for the first eight years of operation 
the credit is limited to the first  mw of new nuclear generation in the united states and has an annual cap of million per  mw of national mw capacity limitation allocated to the unit 
in april  the irs provided interim guidance that the  mw of production tax credits generally will be allocated to new nuclear facilities that filed license applications with the nrc by december   had poured safety related concrete prior to january   and were placed in service before january  there is no guarantee that the interim guidance will be incorporated into the final regulations governing the allocation of production tax credits 
multiple utilities have announced plans to pursue new nuclear plants 
there is no guarantee that any nuclear plant we construct would qualify for these or other incentives 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
nuclear nuclear generating units are regulated by the nrc 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  set license conditions  shut down a nuclear unit or take some combination of these actions  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
our nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages  repairs  uprates and certain other modifications 
cr is currently undergoing an extended outage for normal refueling and maintenance as well as a project to increase its generating capability and to replace two steam generators 
during preparations to replace the steam generators  workers discovered a delamination within the concrete of the outer wall of the containment structure 
pef is finalizing the root cause determination of the delamination event and the necessary repair plans 
at present  pef does not have a firm return to service date for cr  finalized repair estimates and replacement power costs  or the impact of insurance recovery 
however  the costs to repair the delamination and associated costs of an outage extension  such as fuel  purchased power and maintenance  could be material 
based on the current understanding of the cause of the delamination event and the conceptual repair strategy  pef expects that cr will return to service in mid the nrc operating licenses for pec s nuclear units are currently operating under licenses that expire between and the nrc has granted pec year renewals of the licenses for its nuclear units  which extend the operating licenses to expire between and the nrc operating license held by pef for cr currently expires in december on march   the nrc docketed  or accepted for review  pef s application for a year renewal on the operating license for cr  which would extend the operating license through  if approved 
docketing the application does not preclude additional requests for information as the review proceeds  nor does it indicate whether the nrc will renew the license 
the license renewal application for cr is currently under review by the nrc with a decision expected in potential new construction while we have not made a final determination on nuclear construction  we continue to take steps to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
during  pec and pef filed col applications to potentially construct new nuclear plants in north carolina and florida 
the nrc estimates that it will take approximately three to four years to review and process the col applications 
we have focused on the potential construction in florida given the need for more fuel diversity in florida and anticipated federal and state policies to reduce ghg emissions as well as existing state legislative policy that is supportive of nuclear projects 
on january   we announced that pec selected a site at harris to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pec s application submission 
on february   pec filed its col application with the nrc for two additional reactors at harris 
on april   the nrc docketed  or accepted for review  the harris application 
docketing the application does not preclude additional requests for information as the review proceeds  nor does it indicate whether the nrc will issue the license 
no petitions to intervene have been admitted in the harris col application 
if we receive approval from the nrc and applicable state agencies  and if the decisions to build are made  a new plant would not be online until at least see energy demand above 
on december   we announced that pef selected a greenfield site at levy to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pef s application submission 
in  pef completed the purchase of approximately  acres for levy and associated transmission needs 
in  both the levy county planning commission and the board of commissioners voted unanimously in favor of pef s requests to change the comprehensive land use plan 
on may   the florida department of community affairs issued its final determination that the amendments to the levy county comprehensive plan are in compliance with land use regulations 
in  pef submitted filings for two key state approvals 
first  on march   pef filed a petition for a determination of need for levy with the fpsc 
the fpsc issued a final order granting pef s petition for levy on august  second  on june   pef filed its application for site certification with the fdep 
certification addresses permitting  land use and zoning  and property interests and replaces state and local permits 
certification grants approval for the location of the power plant and its associated facilities such as roadways and electrical transmission lines carrying power to the electrical grid  among others 
certification does not include licenses required by the federal government 
on january   the fdep filed a favorable staff analysis report in advance of certification hearings 
the technical proceedings concluded on march   and the administrative law judge issued a recommended order on certification on may  the power plant siting board  comprised of the governor and the cabinet  issued the levy certification on august  on july   pef filed its col application with the nrc for two reactors 
pef also completed and submitted a limited work authorization request for levy concurrent with the col application 
on october   the nrc docketed  or accepted for review  the levy application 
docketing the application does not preclude additional requests for information as the review proceeds  nor does it indicate whether the nrc will issue the license 
on february   pef received the nrc s schedule for review and approval of the col 
one joint petition to intervene in the licensing proceeding was filed with the nrc within the day notice period by the green party of florida  the nuclear information and resource service and the ecology party of florida 
on april   the atomic safety licensing board aslb heard oral arguments on whether any of the joint interveners proposed contentions will be admitted in the levy col proceeding 
on july   the aslb issued a decision accepting three of the contentions submitted 
the admitted contentions involved questions about the storage of low level radioactive waste  the potential impacts of plant construction and operation on the aquifer and surrounding waters and the potential impact of salt water drift from cooling tower operation 
pef s appeal of the aslb s decision was denied and a hearing on the contentions will be conducted in other col applicants have received similar petitions raising similar potential contentions 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef expects a schedule shift for the commercial operation dates of the levy nuclear units 
pef s initial schedule anticipated the ability to perform certain site work pursuant to a limited work authorization from the nrc prior to col receipt 
however  in  the nrc staff determined that certain schedule critical work that pef had proposed to perform within the limited work authorization scope will not be authorized until the nrc issues the col 
consequently  excavation and foundation preparation work will be shifted until after col issuance 
this factor alone resulted in a minimum month schedule shift later than the originally anticipated to timeframe 
additional schedule shifts are likely given  among other things  the permitting and licensing process  state of florida and macro economic conditions  and recent fpsc dsm and energy efficiency goals and other decisions 
uncertainty regarding access to capital on reasonable terms could be another factor to affect the levy schedule 
in light of the regulatory schedule shift and other factors  our anticipated capital expenditures for levy will be significantly less in the near term than previously planned 
later in  pef will file its annual nuclear cost recovery filing with the fpsc  which will reflect our latest plan regarding levy 
as discussed below  the schedule shift will reduce the near term capital expenditures for the project and also reduce the near term impact on customer rates 
the schedule shift will also allow more time for certainty around federal climate change policy  which is currently being debated 
we believe that continuing  although at a slower pace than initially anticipated  is a reasonable and prudent course at this early stage of the project 
we still consider levy as pef s preferred baseload generation option  taking into account cost  potential carbon regulation  fossil fuel price volatility and the benefits of fuel diversification 
along with the fpsc s annual prudence reviews  we will continue to evaluate the project on an ongoing basis based on certain criteria  including public  regulatory and political support  adequate financial cost recovery mechanisms  customer rate impacts  project feasibility and availability and terms of capital financing 
pef signed the epc agreement on december   with westinghouse electric company llc and stone webster  inc for two westinghouse ap nuclear units to be constructed at levy 
more than half of the approximate billion contract price is fixed or firm with agreed upon escalation factors 
the total escalated cost for the two generating units was estimated in pef s petition for the determination of need for levy to be approximately billion 
this total cost estimate includes land  plant components  financing costs  construction  labor  regulatory fees and the initial core for the two units 
an additional billion was estimated for the necessary transmission equipment and approximately miles of transmission lines associated with the project 
the epc agreement includes various incentives  warranties  performance guarantees  liquidated damage provisions and parent guarantees designed to incent the contractor to perform efficiently 
for termination without cause  the epc agreement contains exit provisions with termination fees  which may be significant  that vary based on the termination circumstances 
we anticipate amending the epc agreement due to the schedule shift previously discussed but cannot predict the impact such amendment might have on the project s cost  if any 
florida regulations allow investor owned utilities such as pef to recover prudently incurred site selection costs  preconstruction costs and the carrying cost on construction cost balance of a nuclear power plant prior to commercial operation 
the costs are recovered on an annual basis through the ccrc 
such amounts will not be included in a utility s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
the nuclear cost recovery rule also has a provision to recover costs should the project be abandoned after the utility receives a final order granting a determination of need 
these costs include any unrecovered construction work in progress at the time of abandonment and any other prudent and reasonable exit costs 
in addition  the rule requires the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
in  pef sought and received approval from the fpsc to recover levy preconstruction and carrying charges of million as well as site selection costs of million through the ccrc 
in  pef received approval to defer until the recovery of million of these costs see note c 
on october   the fpsc approved the recovery of million of preconstruction costs  carrying costs and incremental o m incurred or anticipated to be incurred during and the projected costs associated with levy as part of the total million fpsc approved recovery of nuclear costs through the ccrc see note c 
at december   pef s unrecovered investment in levy totaled million  of which million is recoverable in retail rates through the florida nuclear cost recovery rules  including million of construction work in progress  of which million was reflected as a regulatory asset pursuant to accelerated regulatory recovery of nuclear costs and million was reflected as a deferred fuel regulatory asset 
the remaining million is apportioned to pef s wholesale jurisdiction and would be recovered through pef s wholesale rates 
if levy is deferred or cancelled  pef may incur additional contract suspension  termination and or exit costs that would increase its unrecovered investment 
the magnitude of these contract suspension  termination and exit costs cannot be determined at this time 
pec s jurisdictions also have laws encouraging nuclear baseload generation 
south carolina law includes provisions for cost recovery mechanisms associated with nuclear baseload generation 
north carolina law authorizes the ncuc to allow annual prudence reviews of baseload generating plant construction costs and inclusion of construction work in progress in rate base with corresponding rate adjustment in a general rate case while a baseload generating plant is under construction see other matters regulatory environment 
spent nuclear fuel matters under federal law  the doe is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste 
we have a contract with the doe for the future storage and disposal of our spent nuclear fuel 
delays have occurred in the doe s proposed permanent repository to be located at yucca mountain  nev 
the obama administration has determined that yucca mountain  nev  is not a workable option for a nuclear waste repository and will discontinue its program to construct a repository at this site in the administration will continue to explore alternatives 
debate surrounding any new strategy likely will address centralized interim storage  permanent storage at multiple sites and or spent nuclear fuel reprocessing 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
the nrc has proposed revisions to its waste confidence findings that would remove the provisions stating that the nrc s confidence in waste management  underlying the licensing of reactors  is based in part on a permanent repository being in operation by instead  the nrc states that repository capacity will be available within to years beyond the licensed operation of all reactors  and that used fuel generated in any reactor can be safely stored on site without significant environmental impact for at least years beyond the licensed operation of the reactor 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
on september   the nrc proposed licensing requirements for storage of spent nuclear fuel  which would clarify the term limits for specific licenses for independent spent fuel storage installations and for certificates of compliance for spent nuclear fuel storage casks 
the agency proposal would formalize the site by site exemption the nrc has used for renewal applications requesting more than the current year duration 
the initial and renewal terms of a specific installation license would be effective for a period of up to years 
similarly  the proposed rule would allow applicants for certificates of compliance to request initial and renewal terms of up to years  provided they can demonstrate that all design requirements are satisfied for the requested term 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
with certain modifications and additional approvals by the nrc  including the installation and or expansion of on site dry cask storage facilities at pec s robinson nuclear plant robinson  brunswick and cr  the utilities spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel generated by their respective systems through the expiration of the operating licenses  including any license renewals  for their nuclear generating units 
harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license 
see note d for information about the complaint filed by the utilities in the united states court of federal claims against the doe for its failure to fulfill its contractual obligation to receive spent fuel from nuclear plants 
failure to open the yucca mountain or other facility would leave the doe open to further claims by utilities 
environmental matters we are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes  and other environmental matters 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to our business and operations and believe we have all necessary permits to conduct such operations 
hazardous and solid waste management the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  authorize the epa to require the cleanup of hazardous waste sites 
this statute imposes retroactive joint and several liability 
some states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  have similar types of statutes 
we are periodically notified by regulators  including the epa and various state agencies  of our involvement or potential involvement in sites that may require investigation and or remediation 
there are presently several sites with respect to which we have been notified of our potential liability by the epa  the state of north carolina  the state of florida or potentially responsible parties prp groups 
various organic materials associated with the production of manufactured gas  generally referred to as coal tar  are regulated under federal and state laws 
pec and pef are each prps at several manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
we are also currently in the process of assessing potential costs and exposures at other sites 
these costs are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses see notes and 
both pec and pef evaluate potential claims against other prps and insurance carriers and plan to submit claims for cost recovery where appropriate 
the outcome of potential and pending claims cannot be predicted 
hazardous and solid waste management matters are discussed in detail in note a 
we accrue costs to the extent our liability is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
because the extent of environmental impact  allocation among prps for all sites  remediation alternatives which could involve either minimal or significant efforts  and concurrence of the regulatory authorities have not yet reached the stage where a reasonable estimate of the remediation costs can be made  we cannot determine the total costs that may be incurred in connection with the remediation of all sites at this time 
it is probable that current estimates could change and additional losses  which could be material  may be incurred in the future 
as discussed in other matters regulatory environment  as of january   dams at utility fossil fired power plants  including dams for ash ponds  are subject to the north carolina dam safety act s applicable provisions  including state inspection 
until the state agency responsible for dam safety inspects each of the affected dams  we cannot predict if additional safety related measures will be required 
however  these dams have been subject to periodic third party inspection in accordance with prior applicable requirements 
the epa and a number of states are considering additional regulatory measures that may affect management  treatment  marketing and disposal of coal combustion products  primarily ash  from each of the utilities coal fired plants 
revised or new laws or regulations under consideration may impose changes in solid waste classifications or groundwater protection environmental controls 
compliance plans and estimated costs to meet the requirements of new regulations will be determined when any new regulations are finalized 
we are also evaluating the effect on groundwater quality from past and current operations  which may result in operational changes and additional measures under existing regulations 
these issues are also under evaluation by state agencies 
detailed plans and cost estimates will be determined if these evaluations reveal that corrective actions are necessary 
in june  the epa evaluated information about ash impoundment dams nationwide and posted a listing of utility ash impoundment dams that are considered to have high hazard potential  including two of pec s ash impoundment dams 
a high hazard potential rating is not related to the stability of those ash ponds but to the potential for harm should the impoundment dam fail 
as noted above  all of the dams at pec s coal ash ponds have been subject to periodic third party inspection 
in september  the epa rated the high hazard potential impoundments  as well as other impoundments  from unsatisfactory to satisfactory based on their structural integrity and associated documentation 
only dams rated as unsatisfactory would be considered to pose an immediate safety threat  but none of the facilities received an unsatisfactory rating 
in total  six of pec s ash pond dams  including one high hazard potential impoundment  were rated as poor based on the contract inspector s desire to see additional documentation and their evaluations of vegetation management and minor erosion control 
inspectors applied the same criteria to both active and inactive ash ponds  despite the fact that most of the inactive ash impoundments no longer hold water and do not pose a risk of breaching and spilling 
pec has completed several of the recommendations for the active ponds and other recommendations are under way 
we are working with the north carolina dam safety program to evaluate the remaining recommendations 
we do not expect mitigation of these issues to have a material impact on our results of operations 
air quality and water quality we are  or may ultimately be  subject to various current and proposed federal  state and local environmental compliance laws and regulations  which likely would result in increased capital expenditures and o m expenses 
additionally  congress is considering legislation that would require reductions in air emissions of nox  sulfur dioxide so  co and mercury 
some of these proposals establish nationwide caps and emission rates over an extended period of time 
this national multipollutant approach to air pollution control could involve significant capital costs that could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
control equipment installed pursuant to the provisions of cair  cavr and mercury regulations  which are discussed below  may address some of the issues outlined above 
pec and pef have been developing an integrated compliance strategy to meet the requirements of the cair  cavr and mercury regulation see discussion of the court decisions that impacted the cair  the delisting determination and the camr below 
the cavr requires the installation of best available retrofit technology bart on certain units 
however  the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
clean smokestacks act in june  the clean smokestacks act was enacted in north carolina requiring the state s electric utilities to reduce the emissions of nox and so from their north carolina coal fired power plants in phases by pec currently has approximately  mw of coal fired generation capacity in north carolina that is affected by the clean smokestacks act 
on march   pec filed its annual estimate with the ncuc of the total capital expenditures to meet emission targets under the clean smokestacks act by the end of  which were approximately billion at the time of the filing 
as discussed in other matters regulatory environment  north carolina enacted a law in july that abbreviates the certification process for a public utility to construct a new natural gas plant as long as the public utility permanently retires the existing coal units at that specific site 
the law gives pec the option to seek certification  construct a new natural gas plant and retire existing coal units  with resulting reduced emissions  in time to comply with the clean smokestacks act s emission targets 
as discussed in note b on october   the ncuc issued an order granting pec a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a mw combined cycle natural gas fueled electric generating facility at a site in wayne county  nc  to replace three coal fired generating units at the site that have a combined generating capacity of approximately mw 
pec projects that the generating facility would be in service by january on december   pec filed with the ncuc a plan to retire  no later than december  all of its coal fired generating facilities in north carolina that do not have scrubbers 
these facilities total approximately  mw at four sites 
pec modified its clean smokestacks act compliance plan to remove retrofitting pec s sutton plant with emission reduction technology from the plan 
accordingly  pec filed a revised estimate with the ncuc totaling billion of capital expenditures to meet the clean smokestacks act emission targets 
we are continuing to evaluate various design  technology  generation and fuel options  including retiring some coal fired plants that could change expenditures required to maintain compliance with the clean smokestacks act limits subsequent to o m expenses increase with the operation of pollution control equipment due to the cost of reagents  additional personnel and general maintenance associated with the pollution control equipment 
pec is allowed to recover the cost of reagents and certain other costs under its fuel clause  all other o m expenses are currently recoverable through base rates 
two of pec s largest coal fired generating units the roxboro no 
and mayo units impacted by the clean smokestacks act are jointly owned 
in  pec entered into an agreement with the joint owner to limit their aggregate costs associated with capital expenditures to comply with the clean smokestacks act and recognized a liability related to this indemnification see note b 
clean air interstate rule the cair issued by the epa on march   required the district of columbia and states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  to reduce nox and so emissions 
the cair set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nox and beginning in and  respectively  for so states were required to adopt rules implementing the cair  and the epa approved the north carolina cair  the south carolina cair and the florida cair in the air quality controls installed to comply with the requirements of the nox state implementation plan call rule under section of the clean air act nox sip call and clean smokestacks act  as well as plans to replace a portion of pec s coal fired generation with gas fueled generation  largely address the cair requirements for our north carolina units at pec 
pef met the phase i requirements for nox and anticipates meeting the phase i requirements of cair for nox and so with a combination of emission reductions generated by in service emission control equipment and emission allowances 
pef s cr equipment was placed in service on december   and pef s cr equipment is expected to be placed in service in on july   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc court of appeals issued its decision on multiple challenges to the cair  which vacated the cair in its entirety 
on december   the dc court of appeals remanded the cair  without vacating the rule  for the epa to conduct further proceedings consistent with the dc court of appeals prior opinion 
this decision leaves the cair in effect until such time that it is revised or replaced 
the epa informed the dc court of appeals that development and finalization of a replacement rule could take approximately two years 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
under an agreement with the fdep  pef will retire crystal river units no 
and coal fired steam turbines cr and cr and operate emission control equipment at cr and cr cr and cr will be retired after the second proposed nuclear unit at levy completes its first fuel cycle  which was anticipated to be around pef is required to advise the fdep of any developments that will delay the retirement of cr and cr beyond the originally anticipated completion date of the first fuel cycle for levy unit accordingly  pef has advised the fdep of an expected shift in the levy schedule as discussed in other matters nuclear potential new construction 
we are currently evaluating the impacts of the levy schedule 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
clean air mercury rule on march   the epa finalized two separate but related rules the camr that set mercury emissions limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  and encouraged a cap and trade approach to achieving those caps  and a delisting rule that eliminated any requirement to pursue a maximum achievable control technology mact approach for limiting mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
on february   the dc court of appeals vacated the delisting determination and the camr 
the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal of the dc court of appeals decision in january as a result  the epa subsequently announced that it will develop a mact standard consistent with the agency s original listing determination 
the three states in which the utilities operate adopted mercury regulations implementing the camr and submitted their state implementation rules to the epa 
the north carolina mercury rule contains a requirement that all coal fired units in the state install mercury controls by december   and requires compliance plan applications to be submitted in the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
clean air visibility rule on june   the epa issued the final cavr 
the epa s rule requires states to identify facilities  including power plants  built between august and august with the potential to produce emissions that affect visibility in specially protected areas  including national parks and wilderness areas  designated as class i areas 
to help restore visibility in those areas  states must require the identified facilities to install bart to control their emissions 
pec s bart eligible units are asheville units no 
and no 
 roxboro units no 
 no 
and no 
 and sutton unit no 
pef s bart eligible units are anclote units no 
and no 
 cr and cr the reductions associated with bart begin in as discussed above  on december   pef and the fdep announced an agreement under which pef will retire cr and cr as coal fired units 
the cavr included the epa s determination that compliance with the nox and so requirements of the cair could be used by states as a bart substitute to fulfill bart obligations  but the states could require the installation of additional air quality controls if they did not achieve reasonable progress in improving visibility 
the dc court of appeals december  decision remanding the cair maintained its implementation such that cair satisfies bart for so and nox 
should this determination change as the cair is revised  cavr compliance eventually may require consideration of nox and so emissions in addition to particulate matter emissions for bart eligible units 
we are assessing the potential impact of bart and its implications with respect to our plans and estimated costs to comply with the cavr 
on december   the fdep finalized a regional haze implementation rule that goes beyond bart by requiring sources significantly impacting visibility in class i areas to install additional controls by december  however  the fdep has not determined the level of additional controls pef may need to implement 
the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
compliance strategy both pec and pef have been developing an integrated compliance strategy to meet the requirements of the cair  the cavr  mercury regulation and related air quality regulations 
the air quality controls installed to comply with the requirements of the nox sip call and clean smokestacks act  as well as plans to replace a portion of pec s coal fired generation with gas fueled generation  resulted in a reduction of the costs to meet pec s cair requirements 
pec has completed installation of controls to meet the nox sip call requirements 
the nox sip call is not applicable to sources in florida 
expenditures for the nox sip call included the cost to install nox controls under programs by north carolina and south carolina to comply with the federal eight hour ozone standard 
the fpsc approved pef s petition to develop and implement an integrated clean air compliance plan to comply with the cair  camr and cavr and for recovery of prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve this strategy through the ecrc see discussion above regarding the vacating of the camr and remanding of the cair 
pef s april  filing with the fpsc for true up of final environmental costs included a review of the integrated clean air compliance plan  which reconfirmed the efficacy of the recommended plan and included an estimated total project cost of approximately billion to be spent through  to plan  design  build and install pollution control equipment at the anclote and crystal river plants 
as discussed in note c  on august   pef filed for recovery of costs through the ecrc  and the fpsc approved pef s filing on november  additional costs may be incurred if pollution controls are required in order to comply with the requirements of the cavr  as discussed above  or to meet revised compliance requirements of a revised or new implementing rule for the cair 
subsequent rule interpretations  increases in the underlying material  labor and equipment costs  equipment availability  or the unexpected acceleration of compliance dates  among other things  could result in significant increases in our estimated costs to comply and acceleration of some projects 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
environmental compliance cost estimates environmental compliance cost estimates are dependent upon a variety of factors and  as such  are highly uncertain and subject to change 
factors impacting our environmental compliance cost estimates include new and frequently changing laws and regulations  the impact of legal decisions on environmental laws and regulations  changes in the demand for  supply of and costs of labor and materials  changes in the scope and timing of projects  various design  technology and new generation options  and projections of fuel sources  prices  availability and security 
costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses 
the outcome of future petitions for recovery cannot be predicted 
our estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly 
we cannot predict the impact that the epa s further cair proceedings will have on our compliance with the cavr requirements and will continue to reassess our plans and estimated costs to comply with the cavr 
the timing and extent of the costs for future projects will depend upon final compliance strategies

all environmental compliance projects under the first phase of clean smokestacks act emission reductions  which included projects at pec s asheville  lee  mayo and roxboro plants  have been placed in service 
on december   pec filed with the ncuc a plan to retire no later than december   all of its coal fired generating facilities in north carolina that do not have scrubbers 
these facilities total approximately  mw at four sites 
additional projects requiring material environmental compliance costs may be implemented in the future to meet compliance requirements 
to date  expenditures at pef for cair regulation primarily relate to environmental compliance projects at cr and cr the cr project was placed in service on december   and the cr project is expected to be placed in service in as a result of changes in the scope of work related to estimation of costs for compliance with the cair and the uncertainty regarding the epa s further cair proceedings  the delisting determination and the camr discussed above  pef is currently unable to estimate certain costs of compliance 
however  pef believes that future costs to comply with new or subsequent rule interpretations could be significant 
compliance plans and estimated costs to meet the requirements of new regulations will be determined when those new regulations are finalized 
north carolina attorney general petition under section of the clean air act in march  the north carolina attorney general filed a petition with the epa  under section of the clean air act  asking the federal government to force fossil fuel fired power plants in other states  including south carolina  to reduce their nox and so emissions 
the state of north carolina contends these out of state emissions interfere with north carolina s ability to meet national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone and particulate matter 
in  the epa issued a final response denying the petition  and the north carolina attorney general filed a petition in the dc court of appeals seeking a review of the agency s denial 
in  the dc court of appeals remanded the epa s denial to the agency for reconsideration 
the outcome of the remand proceeding cannot be predicted 
national ambient air quality standards in  the epa announced changes to the naaqs for particulate matter 
the changes in particulate matter standards did not result in designation of any additional nonattainment areas in pec s or pef s service territories 
environmental groups and states filed a joint petition with the dc court of appeals arguing that the epa s particulate matter rule does not adequately restrict levels of particulate matter  especially with respect to the annual and secondary standards 
on february   the dc court of appeals remanded the annual and secondary standards to the epa for further review and consideration 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
in  the epa revised the hour primary and secondary standards for the naaqs for ground level ozone 
additional nonattainment areas may be designated in pec s and pef s service territories as a result of these revised standards 
on may   a number of states  environmental groups and industry associations filed petitions against the revised naaqs in the dc court of appeals 
the epa requested the dc court of appeals to suspend proceedings in the case while the epa evaluates whether to maintain  modify or otherwise reconsider the revised naaqs 
in september  the epa announced that it is reconsidering the level of the ozone naaqs 
the epa originally indicated plans to designate nonattainment areas for these standards by march however  the epa announced that it will stay those designations until after its reconsideration has been completed 
on january   the epa announced a proposed revision to the primary ozone naaqs 
in addition  the epa proposed a cumulative seasonal secondary standard 
the epa plans to finalize the revisions by august   and to designate nonattainment areas by august the proposed revisions are significantly more stringent than the current naaqs 
should additional nonattainment areas be designated in our service territories  we may be required to install additional emission controls at some of our facilities 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on january   the epa announced a revision to the primary naaqs for nitrogen dioxide 
since  when the first naaqs were promulgated  the standard for nitrogen dioxide has been an annual average 
the epa has retained the annual standard and added a new hour naaqs 
in conjunction with proposing changes to the standard  the epa is also requiring an increase in the coverage of the monitoring network  particularly near roadways where the highest concentrations are expected to occur due to traffic emissions 
the epa plans to designate nonattainment areas by january currently  there are no monitors reporting violation of the new standard in pec s or pef s service territories  but the expanded monitoring network will provide additional data  which could result in additional nonattainment areas 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on december   the epa proposed a new hour naaqs for sulfur dioxide 
the current primary naaqs on a hour average basis and annual average would be eliminated under the proposed rule 
a hour standard in the proposed range is a significant increase in the stringency of the standard and it would increase the risk of nonattainment  especially near uncontrolled coal fired facilities 
should additional nonattainment areas be designated in our service territories  we may be required to install additional emission controls at some of our facilities 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
new source review the epa is conducting an enforcement initiative related to a number of coal fired utility power plants to determine whether changes at those facilities were subject to new source review requirements or new source performance standards under the clean air act 
we were asked to provide information to the epa as part of this initiative and cooperated in supplying the requested information 
the epa has undertaken civil enforcement actions against unaffiliated utilities as part of this initiative 
some of these actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring expenditures by these unaffiliated utilities  several of which included reported expenditures in excess of billion for retrofit of pollution control equipment 
these settlement agreements have generally called for expenditures to be made over extended time periods  and some of the unaffiliated utilities may seek recovery of the related costs through rate adjustments or similar mechanisms 
water quality general as a result of the operation of certain pollution control equipment required to comply with the air quality issues outlined above  new sources of wastewater discharge will be generated at certain affected facilities 
integration of these new wastewater discharges into the existing wastewater treatment processes is currently ongoing and will result in permitting  construction and treatment requirements imposed on the utilities now and into the future 
the future costs of complying with these requirements could be material to our or the utilities results of operations or financial position 
on september   the epa announced that it had completed a multi year study of power plant wastewater discharges and concluded that current regulations have not kept pace with changes in the electric power industry since the regulations were issued in  including addressing impacts to wastewater discharge from operation of air pollution control equipment 
as a result  the epa has announced that it plans to revise the regulations that govern wastewater discharge  which may result in operational changes and additional compliance costs in the future 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
section b of the clean water act section b of the clean water act section b requires cooling water intake structures to reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts 
the epa promulgated a rule implementing section b in respect to existing power plants in july a number of states  environmental groups and others sought judicial review of the july rule 
in  the us court of appeals for the second circuit issued an opinion and order remanding many provisions of the rule to the epa  and the epa suspended the rule pending further rulemaking  with the exception of the requirement that permitted facilities must meet any requirements under section b as determined by the permitting authorities on a case by case  best professional judgment basis 
several parties filed petitions for writ of certiorari to the us supreme court 
on april   the us supreme court issued its opinion holding that the epa  in selecting the best technology pursuant to section b  does have the authority to reject technology when its costs are wholly disproportionate to the benefits expected 
also  the us supreme court held that epa s site specific variance procedure contained in the july rule was permissible in that the procedure required testing to determine whether costs would be significantly greater than the benefits before a variance would be considered 
as a result of these developments  our plans and associated estimated costs to comply with section b will need to be reassessed and determined in accordance with any revised or new implementing rule after it is established by the epa 
costs of compliance with a revised or new implementing rule are expected to be higher  and could be significantly higher  than estimated costs under the july rule 
our cost estimates to comply with the july rule were million to million  including million to million at pec and million to million at pef 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
other environmental matters global climate change growing state  federal and international attention to global climate change may result in the regulation of co and other ghgs 
as discussed under other matters regulatory environment  on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of this bill would establish a national cap and trade program to reduce ghg emissions as well as a national reps 
the us senate is considering similar proposals 
final legislation will depend upon changes made during the legislative process to the provisions and the manner in which key provisions are implemented  including for the regulation of carbon 
in addition  the obama administration has begun the process of regulating ghg emissions through use of the clean air act 
on april   the us supreme court ruled that the epa has the authority under the clean air act to regulate co emissions from new automobiles 
on december   the epa announced that six ghgs co  methane  nitrous oxide  hydrofluorocarbons  perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride pose a threat to public health and welfare under the clean air act 
a number of parties have filed petitions for review of this finding in the dc court of appeals 
the full impact of final legislation  if enacted  and additional regulation resulting from other federal ghg initiatives cannot be determined at this time  however  we anticipate that it could result in significant cost increases over time for which the utilities would seek corresponding rate recovery 
we are preparing for a carbon constrained future and are actively engaged in helping shape effective policies to address the issue 
as discussed under other matters regulatory environment  in the state of florida passed comprehensive energy legislation  which includes a directive that the fdep develop rules to establish a cap and trade program to regulate ghg emissions that would be presented to the legislature no earlier than january the fdep is currently in the process of studying ghg policy options and the potential economic impacts  but it has not developed a regulation for the consideration of the legislature 
as discussed under clean smokestacks act  on july   the governor of north carolina signed into law a bill that may impact pec s clean smokestacks act compliance plans 
while state level study groups have been active in all three of our jurisdictions  we continue to believe that this issue requires a national policy framework one that provides certainty and consistency 
our balanced solution as discussed in other matters energy demand is a comprehensive plan to meet the anticipated demand in the utilities service territories and provides a solid basis for slowing and reducing co emissions by focusing on energy efficiency  alternative energy and state of the art power generation 
there are ongoing efforts to reach a new international climate change treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol 
the kyoto protocol was adopted in by the united nations to address global climate change by reducing emissions of co and other ghgs 
although the treaty went into effect on february   the united states has not adopted it 
in december  the united nations framework convention on climate change convened the th conference of the parties to conduct further negotiations on ghg emissions reductions 
at the conclusion of the conference  a number of the parties  including the united states  entered into a nonbinding accord calling upon the parties to submit emission reduction targets for to the united nations framework convention on climate change secretariat by the end of january on january   president obama submitted a proposal to reduce the us ghg emissions in the range of percent below levels by  subject to future congressional action 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by the kyoto protocol  potential new international treaties or federal or state proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
the cost impact of legislation or regulation to address global climate change would depend on the specific legislation or regulation enacted and cannot be determined at this time 
prior to  the epa received waiver requests from a number of states to allow those states to set standards for co emissions from new vehicles 
the epa denied those requests 
on january   the obama administration requested the epa to review those denials of waiver requests 
on june   the epa granted california s waiver request  enabling the state to enforce its ghg emissions standards for new motor vehicles  beginning with the current model year 
additional states may set similar standards as a result of the decision 
the impact of this development cannot be predicted 
on september   the epa issued the final ghg emissions reporting rule  which establishes a national protocol for the reporting of annual ghg emissions 
facilities that emit greater than  metric tons per year of ghgs must report emissions by march of each year beginning in for year emissions 
because the rule builds on current emission reporting requirements  compliance with the requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the utilities 
synthetic fuels tax credits historically  we had substantial operations associated with the production of coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under section of the internal revenue code the code section and as redesignated effective as section k of the code section k as discussed below 
the production and sale of these products qualified for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements were satisfied 
qualifying synthetic fuels facilities entitled their owners to federal income tax credits based on the barrel of oil equivalent of the synthetic fuels produced and sold by these plants 
the synthetic fuels tax credit program expired at the end of  and the synthetic fuels businesses were abandoned and reclassified to discontinued operations 
legislation enacted in redesignated the section tax credit as a general business credit under section k of the code effective january  the previous amount of section tax credits that we were allowed to claim in any calendar year through december   was limited by the amount of our regular federal income tax liability 
section tax credit amounts allowed but not utilized are carried forward indefinitely as deferred alternative minimum tax credits 
the redesignation of section tax credits as a section k general business credit removed the regular federal income tax liability limit on synthetic fuels production and subjects the credits to a one year carry back period and a year carry forward period 
total section k credits generated under the synthetic fuels tax credit program including those generated by florida progress prior to our acquisition were billion  of which billion has been used through december   to offset regular federal income tax liability and million is being carried forward as deferred tax credits

liquidity and capital resources overview pec has primarily used a combination of debt securities  commercial paper and its revolving credit agreement for liquidity needs in excess of cash provided by operations 
pec also participates in the utility money pool  which allows pec and pef to lend and borrow to and from each other 
see discussion of pec s credit ratings in progress energy credit rating matters 
pec expects to have sufficient resources to meet its future obligations through a combination of internally generated funds  commercial paper borrowings  money pool borrowings  its credit facility  long term debt  preferred stock and or contributions of equity from the parent 
cash flow discussion historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations in  net cash provided by operating activities increased when compared to the million increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million increase in the recovery of deferred fuel costs due to higher fuel rates in  million in lower net income tax payments and a million decrease in inventory purchases primarily driven by lower coal prices 
these impacts were partially offset by million of pension and other benefits contributions made in in  net cash provided by operating activities increased when compared to the million increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million increase in cash receipts from a wholesale customer due to the expiration of a prepayment agreement  income tax impacts including million in lower income tax payments  a million increase from accounts payable and payables to affiliates  largely driven by the timing of payments  a million increase from timing of customer collections  and a million increase from net interest payments 
these impacts were partially offset by a million decrease in the recovery of fuel costs  largely driven by an under recovery of fuels costs in  and a million increase in inventory purchases  primarily coal  driven by higher prices 
investing activities in  net cash used by investing activities increased million when compared with the increase was primarily due to a million increase in advances to affiliated companies and a million increase in gross property additions  partially offset by a million decrease in nuclear fuel additions 
property additions are primarily for normal construction activity and ongoing capital expenditures related to environmental compliance programs 
in  net cash used by investing activities increased million when compared with the increase was primarily due to a million increase from changes in advances to affiliated companies and a million decrease in net proceeds from available for sale securities and other investments 
available for sale securities and other investments include marketable debt securities and investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities increased million for when compared to the increase in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to the million in dividends paid to the parent in  the million net repayment of commercial paper in  the million issuance of commercial paper in and the million increase in the payment at maturity of long term debt in compared to these impacts were partially offset by a million increase in the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in compared to  as well as the million repayment of advances from affiliates in net cash used by financing activities decreased million for when compared to the decrease in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to million in net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in  million in dividends paid to the parent in  and outstanding commercial paper issuances of million  offset by a million change in advances from affiliated companies and a million increase in the retirement of long term debt 
on january   pec issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due a portion of the proceeds was used to repay the maturity of pec s million senior notes  due march  the remaining proceeds were used to repay pec s outstanding money pool balance and for general corporate purposes 
on june   pec entered into a seventy seventh supplemental indenture to its mortgage and deed of trust  dated may   as supplemented  in connection with certain amendments to the mortgage 
the amendments are set forth in the seventy seventh supplemental indenture and include an amendment to extend the maturity date of the mortgage by years 
the maturity date of the mortgage is now may  on march   pec amended its rca with a syndication of financial institutions to extend the termination date by one year 
the extension was effective on march  pec s rca is now scheduled to expire on june  on march   pec issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due the proceeds were used to repay the maturity of pec s million medium term notes  series d  due april   and the remainder was placed in temporary investments for general corporate use as needed 
on november   pec  the parent  as a well known seasoned issuer  and pef filed a combined shelf registration statement with the sec  which became effective upon filing with the sec 
the registration statement is effective for three years and does not limit the amount or number of various securities that can be issued 
see credit facilities and registration statements 
on august   due to extreme volatility in the commercial paper market  pec borrowed million under its million rca and paid at maturity million of its first mortgage bonds 
on september   pec used million of available cash on hand to repay a portion of the amount borrowed under the rca 
on october   pec repaid the remaining million of its rca loan using available cash on hand 
future liquidity and capital resources pec s estimated capital requirements for  and are approximately billion to billion  billion and billion  respectively  and primarily reflect construction expenditures to support customer growth  add regulated generation and upgrade existing facilities as discussed in progress energy capital expenditures 
pec expects to fund its capital requirements primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt  preferred stock and or contributions of equity from the parent 
in addition  pec has a million credit facility that supports the issuance of commercial paper 
access to the commercial paper market and the utility money pool provide additional liquidity to help meet pec s working capital requirements 
over the long term  meeting the anticipated load growth will require a balanced approach  including energy conservation and efficiency programs  development and deployment of new energy technologies  and new generation  transmission and distribution facilities  potentially including new baseload generation facilities in the carolinas toward the end of the next decade 
this approach will require pec to make significant capital investments 
see progress energy introduction strategy for additional information 
pec may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
pec has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which it may issue an unlimited number or amount of various long term debt securities and preferred stock

market risk and derivatives under its risk management policy  pec may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
contractual obligations pec is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years 
these contracts include financial arrangements such as debt agreements and leases  as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services 
in most cases  these contracts contain provisions for price adjustments  minimum purchase levels and other financial commitments 
the commitment amounts in the following table are estimates and therefore will likely differ from actual purchase amounts

investing activities in  net cash used by investing activities increased million when compared with the increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to a million decrease in settlements of advances to affiliates and a million increase in nuclear fuel additions  partially offset by a million decrease in property additions 
the decrease in property additions was driven by decreases in environmental compliance spending and completion of the bartow plant repowering project  partially offset by an increase in expenditures for nuclear projects 
in  net cash used by investing activities increased million when compared with the increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to a million increase in capital expenditures for utility property additions  partially offset by a million decrease from changes in advances to affiliated companies 
the increase in capital expenditures for utility property additions was primarily driven by a million increase in environmental compliance expenditures and a million increase in nuclear project expenditures  partially offset by a million decrease related to repowering the bartow plant to more efficient natural gas burning technology and a million decrease related to the hines facility  which was placed in service in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased million for when compared to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to pef s billion in net proceeds from issuance of long term debt in  outstanding commercial paper issuances of million in  and repayment of commercial paper outstanding of million in  partially offset by receipts of million in contributions from the parent in and million long term debt retirements in net cash provided by financing activities increased million for when compared to the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to pef s billion in net proceeds from issuance of long term debt and outstanding commercial paper issuances of million in  partially offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of million of long term debt in and a million increase in long term debt retirements

future liquidity and capital resources pef s estimated capital requirements for  and are approximately billion to billion  billion and billion  respectively  and primarily reflect construction expenditures to support customer growth  add regulated generation  upgrade existing facilities and add environmental control facilities as discussed in progress energy capital expenditures 
pef s estimated capital requirements include potential nuclear construction expenditures for levy 
forecasted potential nuclear construction expenditures are dependent upon  and may vary significantly based upon  the decision to build  regulatory approval schedules  timing and escalation of project costs  and the percentages of joint ownership 
because of anticipated schedule shifts  we anticipate amending the epc agreement see discussion in progress energy other matters nuclear potential new construction  and the forecasted capital expenditures reflect the anticipated impact of such amendment 
if levy is deferred or cancelled  pef may incur contract suspension  termination and or exit costs 
the magnitude of these contract suspension  termination and exit costs cannot be determined at this time  and  accordingly  are not included in forecasted capital expenditures 
potential nuclear construction expenditures are subject to cost recovery provisions in the utilities respective jurisdictions 
forecasted potential nuclear construction expenditures for  and include approximately million  million and million  respectively  of preconstruction expenditures  which are eligible for recovery under florida s nuclear cost recovery rule 
pef expects to fund its capital requirements primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt  preferred stock and or contributions of equity from the parent 
in addition  pef has a million credit facility that supports the issuance of commercial paper 
access to the commercial paper market and the utility money pool provide additional liquidity to help meet pef s working capital requirements 
at december   the current portion of pef s long term debt was million  which we expect to fund with long term debt issued in over the long term  meeting the anticipated load growth will require a balanced approach  including energy conservation and efficiency programs  development and deployment of new energy technologies  and new generation  transmission and distribution facilities  potentially including new baseload generation facilities in florida 
this approach will require pef to make significant capital investments 
pef may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
pef has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which it may issue an unlimited number or amount of various long term debt securities and preferred stock

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations see discussion under progress energy and notes a  b and c for information on pef s off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations at december  market risk and derivatives under its risk management policy  pef may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks related to changes in market conditions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have a risk management committee that includes senior executives from various business groups 
the risk management committee is responsible for administering risk management policies and monitoring compliance with those policies by all subsidiaries 
under our risk policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
such instruments contain credit risk to the extent that the counterparty fails to perform under the contract 
we minimize such risk by performing credit and financial reviews using a combination of financial analysis and publicly available credit ratings of such counterparties see note 
both pec and pef also have limited counterparty exposure for commodity hedges primarily gas and oil hedges by spreading concentration risk over a number of counterparties 
the following disclosures about market risk contain forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review item a  risk factors  and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
certain market risks are inherent in our financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
our primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt and commercial paper  fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to our ndt funds  changes in the market value of cvos and changes in energy related commodity prices 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with our operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
progress energy interest rate risk as part of our debt portfolio management and daily cash management  we have variable rate long term debt and typically have commercial paper and or loans outstanding under our rca facilities  which are also exposed to floating interest rates 
approximately percent and percent of consolidated debt had variable rates at december  and  respectively 
based on our variable rate long term debt balances at december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual pre tax interest expense change of approximately million 
based on our short term debt balances at december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an insignificant annual pre tax interest expense change 
from time to time  we use interest rate derivative instruments to adjust the mix between fixed and floating rate debt in our debt portfolio  to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with certain debt instruments and to hedge interest rates with regard to future fixed rate debt issuances 
the notional amounts of interest rate derivatives are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the exposure in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
we use a number of models and methods to determine interest rate risk exposure and fair value of derivative positions 
for reporting purposes  fair values and exposures of derivative positions are determined as of the end of the reporting period using the bloomberg financial markets system 
in accordance with gaap  interest rate derivatives that qualify as hedges are separated into one of two categories cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in cash flow due to fluctuating interest rates 
fair value hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate changes 
the following tables provide information at december  and  about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate long term debt and florida progress obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of trust 
the tables also include estimates of the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
for interest rate forward contracts  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual mandatory termination dates for to and thereafter and the related fair value 
notional amounts are used to calculate the settlement amounts under the interest rate forward contracts

marketable securities price risk the utilities maintain trust funds  pursuant to nrc requirements  to fund certain costs of decommissioning their nuclear plants 
these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
at december  and  the fair value of these funds was billion and billion  respectively  including million and million  respectively  for pec and million and million  respectively  for pef 
we actively monitor our portfolio by benchmarking the performance of our investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that the utilities regulated electric rates provide for recovery of these costs net of any trust fund earnings  and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect earnings 
see note for further information on the trust fund securities 
contingent value obligations market value risk in connection with the acquisition of florida progress  the parent issued million cvos 
each cvo represents the right of the holder to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuels facilities purchased by subsidiaries of florida progress in october the payments are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
the cvos are derivatives and are recorded at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
we perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market risk of the cvos 
the sensitivity analysis performed on the cvos uses quoted prices obtained from brokers or quote services to measure the potential loss in earnings from a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices over the next months 
at december  and  the cvo liability included in other liabilities and deferred credits on our consolidated balance sheets was million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical percent increase in the december  market price would result in a million increase in the fair value of the cvos and a corresponding increase in the cvo liability 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  coal  fuel oil  electricity and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of our ownership of energy related assets 
our exposure to these fluctuations is significantly limited by the cost based regulation of the utilities 
each state commission allows electric utilities to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines that such costs are prudent 
therefore  while there may be a delay in the timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered from the ratepayers  changes from year to year have no material impact on operating results 
in addition  most of our long term power sales contracts shift substantially all fuel price risk to the purchaser 
most of our physical commodity contracts are not derivatives or qualify as normal purchases or sales 
therefore  such contracts are not recorded at fair value 
we perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market risk of our derivative commodity instruments that are not eligible for recovery from ratepayers 
the following discussion addresses the stand alone commodity risk created by these derivative commodity instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge 
the sensitivity analysis performed on these derivative commodity instruments uses quoted prices obtained from brokers to measure the potential loss in earnings from a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices over the next months 
at december  and  substantially all derivative commodity instrument positions were subject to retail regulatory treatment 
see note for additional information with regard to our commodity contracts and use of derivative financial instruments 
economic derivatives derivative products  primarily natural gas and oil contracts  may be entered into from time to time for economic hedging purposes 
while management believes the economic hedges mitigate exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices  these instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are monitored consistent with trading positions 
the utilities have derivative instruments related to their exposure to price fluctuations on fuel oil and natural gas purchases 
substantially all of these instruments receive regulatory accounting treatment 
related unrealized gains and losses are recorded in regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets  respectively  on the balance sheets until the contracts are settled see note a 
after settlement of the derivatives and the fuel is consumed  realized gains or losses are passed through the fuel cost recovery clause 
during the years ended december   and  pec recorded a net realized loss of million  a net realized gain of million and a net realized loss of million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  pef recorded a net realized loss of million  a net realized gain of million and a net realized loss of million  respectively 
certain of our hedge agreements may result in the receipt of  or posting of  derivative collateral with our counterparties  depending on the daily derivative position 
fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to our return of collateral received and or our posting of collateral with our counterparty negatively impact our liquidity 
we manage open positions with strict policies that limit our exposure to market risk and require daily reporting to management of potential financial exposures 
at december   the fair value of pec s commodity derivative instruments was recorded as a million short term derivative liability position included in derivative liabilities and a million long term derivative liability position included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the pec consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the fair value of pec s commodity derivative instruments was recorded as a million short term derivative liability position included in derivative liabilities and a million long term derivative liability position included in other liabilities and deferred credits on the pec consolidated balance sheet

certain counterparties have held cash collateral in support of these instruments 
changes in natural gas prices and settlements of financial hedge agreements since december   have impacted the amount of collateral posted with counterparties 
pef s cash collateral asset included in derivative collateral posted on the pef balance sheet was million at december   compared to million at december cash flow hedges the utilities designate a portion of commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
from time to time we hedge exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of power for our forecasted sales 
realized gains and losses are recorded net in operating revenues 
we also hedge exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of fuel for fleet vehicles 
realized gains and losses are recorded net as part of fleet vehicle costs 
at december  and  neither we nor the utilities had material outstanding positions in such contracts 
the ineffective portion of commodity cash flow hedges was not material to our or the utilities results of operations for  and at december  and  the amount recorded in our or the utilities accumulated other comprehensive income related to commodity cash flow hedges was not material
