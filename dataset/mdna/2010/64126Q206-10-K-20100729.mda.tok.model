item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item herein 
management is of the opinion that inflation and changing prices  including foreign exchange fluctuations  will have little  if any  effect on our consolidated financial position or results of our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates involve the use of complicated processes  assumptions  estimates and or judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors and have identified the following critical accounting policies for the current fiscal year 
principles of consolidation we consolidate entities when we have the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of that entity and record the portion we do not own as minority interest 
the determination of our ability to control or exert significant influence over an entity involves the use of judgment 
we apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over  but do not control  the policies and decisions of an entity 
we use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity 
capitalized development costs we capitalize certain third party legal  professional  and other miscellaneous fees directly related to the procurement  evaluation and establishment of contracts for development projects 
development costs are recorded on the cost basis and are amortized over the estimated economic term of the contract 
we review each project on a quarterly basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates are appropriate 
if accumulated costs of a specific project exceed the net realizable value of such project or the project is abandoned  the costs are charged to earnings 
goodwill  other intangible  and other long lived assets in connection with our acquisition of the colorado grande casino on april   and the acquisition of the washington casinos on may   we have goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million  net of amortization 
goodwill represents a significant portion of our total assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise under the provisions of authoritative guidance 
we review goodwill at the reporting level unit  which is one level below an operating segment 
we review the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  based upon a multiple of estimated earnings 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment indicator exists and an estimate of the impairment loss is calculated 
the fair value calculation includes multiple assumptions and estimates  including the projected cash flows and discount rates applied 
changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment that could materially adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
all of our goodwill is attributable to reporting units within our gaming segment 
we use earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda as the measure for future earnings in our impairment test 
management estimates future ebitda based primarily on its projections of future revenues 
we utilized comparable industry average multiples of ebitda rates based on industry standards ranging from to times ebitda when we estimated fair values of our casinos as of april  during the fiscal there were significant declines in the us economies and in the casino industry overall  which led to declines in our revenues  margins and cash flows 
our sales and profitability declined throughout the year 
we considered the impact of these significant adverse changes in the economic and business climate as we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of april  the estimated fair values of our reporting unit were negatively impacted by significant reductions in estimated cash flows for the income approach 
our goodwill impairment analysis led us to conclude that there was a significant impairment of goodwill for the colorado grande and  accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of million to our operating results for the year ended april   for the impairment of our goodwill 
this million expense is included in the impairment of assets expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
this impairment charge did not have an impact on our liquidity  however it was a reflection of the overall downturn in our industry and decline in our projected cash flows 
long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  also comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when impairment indicators are present or when circumstances indicate that impairment may exist under authoritative guidance 
when management believes impairment indicators may exist  projections of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the use of and eventual disposition of long lived assets held for use are prepared 
if the projections indicate that the carrying values of the long lived assets are not recoverable  we reduce the carrying values to fair value 
for long lived assets held for sale  we compare the carrying values to an estimate of fair value less selling costs to determine potential impairment 
we test for impairment of long lived assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are measurable 
these impairment tests are heavily influenced by assumptions and estimates that are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
asset and investment impairments we evaluate an asset or investment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recovered 
these events include market declines that are believed to be other than temporary  changes in the manner in which we intend to use a long lived asset  decisions to sell an asset or investment and adverse changes in the legal or business environment such as adverse actions by regulators 
when an event occurs  we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on either i the long lived asset s ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis or ii the fair value of our investment in unconsolidated affiliates 
if an impairment is indicated or if we decide to exit or sell a long lived asset or group of assets  we adjust the carrying value of these assets downward  if necessary  to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
our fair value estimates are generally based on market data obtained through the sales process or an analysis of expected discounted cash flows 
the magnitude of any impairments are impacted by a number of factors  including the nature of the assets to be sold and our established time frame for completing the sales  among other factors 
we also reclassify the asset or assets as either held for sale or as discontinued operations  depending on  among other criteria  whether we will have any continuing involvement in the cash flows of those assets after they are sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable if we determine that we will not collect all or part of the outstanding balance 
we regularly review collectibility and establish or adjust our allowance as necessary using the specific identification method 
we make advances to third parties under executed promissory notes for project costs related to the development of gaming and entertainment properties 
due diligence is conducted by our management with the assistance of legal counsel prior to entering into arrangements with third parties to provide financing in connection with their efforts to secure and develop the properties 
repayment terms are largely dependent upon the operating performance of each opportunity for which the funds have been loaned 
interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective note 
if projected cash flows are not sufficient to recover amounts due  the note is evaluated to determine the appropriate discount to be recorded on the note for it to be considered a performing note 
if the note is performing  interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we review on a quarterly basis each of our notes receivable to evaluate whether the collection of such note receivable is still probable 
in our analysis  we review the economic feasibility and the current financial  legislative and development status of the project 
if our analysis indicates that the project is no longer economically feasible then the note receivable would be written down to its estimated fair value 
based on this policy  we established a million valuation allowance as of april  in regards to the receivable due from the gillman group 
revenue recognition we record revenues from casino operations  management fees  and interest on notes receivable on the accrual basis as earned 
the dates on which payments are collected may vary depending upon the term of the contracts or note receivable agreements 
interest income related to notes receivable is recorded when earned and its collectibility is reasonably certain 
the retail value of food and beverage and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances 
net revenues do not include the retail amount of food  beverage and other items provided gratuitously to customers 
we record the redemption of coupons and points for cash as a reduction of revenue 
these amounts are included in promotional allowances in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated cost of providing such complimentary services that is included in casino expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was as follows fiscal year ended april  april  food and beverage other total cost of complimentary services accrued jackpot liability we accrue jackpot liability as games are played under a matching concept of coin in 
as of april   we also maintain approximately  in player supported jackpot accrued liability  which are progressive games that customers fund and when a jackpot is hit it is paid from reserved funds 
income taxes income taxes are accounted using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences  using currently enacted tax laws  attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we record current income taxes based on our current taxable income  and we provide for deferred income taxes to reflect estimated future tax payments and receipts 
we account for tax credits under the flow through method  which reduces the provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits first become available 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based on our estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period 
the estimates utilized in recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision  either up or down  in future periods based on new facts or circumstances 
accrued litigation liability we assess our exposure to loss contingencies including legal matters 
if the potential loss is justified to be probable and estimable  we will provide for the exposure 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be impacted 
as of april   we did not record any accrued litigation liability 
share based compensation under asc topic  compensation stock compensation  the fair value and compensation expense of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing formula 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock over a preceding period commensurate with the expected term of the option 
the expected volatility considers factors such as the volatility of our share price 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing formula since we historically have not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
executive overview we were formed in and since  have primarily been a gaming company involved in financing  developing  owning and operating gaming projects 
our gaming facility operations are located in the united states of america us  specifically in the states of colorado and washington

the restricted cash consists of the million project fund referred to above and million of player supported jackpots psj 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will have adequate availability of cash resources to satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have made  and are in the process of making  arrangements to ensure that we have sufficient working capital to fund our obligations as they come due 
these potential funding transactions include divesting of non core assets and obtaining long term financing 
we believe that some or all of these sources of funds will be funded in a timely manner and will provide sufficient working capital for us to meet our obligations as they come due  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in divesting of the non core assets or achieving the desired level of working capital at terms that are favorable to us 
should cash resources not be sufficient to meet our current obligations as they come due  repay or refinance our long term debt and  acquire operations that generate positive cash flow  we would be required to curtail our activities and grow at a pace that cash resources could support which may require a restructuring of our debt or selling core assets of the company

new accounting pronouncements issued as of april   there are several new accounting standards and interpretations effective 
below is a discussion of significant standards that may impact us 
the hierarchy of general accepted accounting principles and the fasb accounting standard codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles replacement of fasb statement no 
in the current fiscal year  financial accounting standards board fasb finalized the fasb accounting standards codification codification or asc  which is effective for periods ending on or after september  accordingly  we have implemented the asc structure required by the fasb and any references to guidance issued by the fasb in these footnotes are to the asc  in addition to other forms of standards 
the asc does not change how we account for our transactions or the nature of the related disclosures made 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 which is now codified under asc topic asc 
asc establishes accounting and reporting standards with respect to the disclosure of a noncontrolling ownership interest in the statement of financial position within equity  the presentation of the share of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income  the accounting treatment of changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains a controlling interest and the accounting for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
asc is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the company currently has no noncontrolling ownership interests in consolidated subsidiaries and therefore is not impacted by asc disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which is now codified under asc topic asc expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities  and is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning may  asc relates specifically to disclosures  and does not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation we consolidate entities when we have the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of that entity and record the portion we do not own as minority interest 
the determination of our ability to control or exert significant influence over an entity involves the use of judgment 
we apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over  but do not control  the policies and decisions of an entity 
we use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity 
consolidations in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  which codified the previously issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
asu changes the consolidation analysis for variable interest entities vies and requires a qualitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie is based on whether the entity has the power to direct matters which most significantly impact the activities of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  of the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie 
the asu requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and also amends the events triggering a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
asu requires additional disclosures for vies  including disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement with vies  how a reporting entity s involvement with a vie affects the reporting entity s financial statements  and significant judgments and assumptions made by the reporting entity to determine whether it must consolidate the vie 
asu is effective for us beginning may  our adoption of asu will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
subsequent events in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events which is codified in fasb asc  subsequent events asc 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
we adopted asc in the second quarter of fiscal and evaluated all events or transactions through the date of this filing 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  which is codified in asc asc establishes principles and requirements to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition transaction and determines what information to disclose to investors regarding the business combination 
asc is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk  commodity price and equity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is credit risk concentrations 
we do not believe we are subject to material interest risk 
all of our borrowings are at fixed interest rates  thus an interest rate change would not have a significant impact on our operations
