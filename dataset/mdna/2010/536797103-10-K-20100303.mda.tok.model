table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with item business  item a 
risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview as discussed in overview in item  business above  we are a leading operator of automotive franchises and retailer of new and used vehicles and services 
as of march   we offered brands of new vehicles and all brands of used vehicles in stores in the united states and online at lithia 
com 
we sell new and used cars and light trucks  replacement parts  provide vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services and arrange related financing  service contracts  protection products and credit insurance 
we believe that the reorganization of chrysler and general motors gm impacted our sales levels relative to the overall market sales environment  particularly in the fourth quarter of the production shutdowns both manufacturers implemented over the summer  coupled with the high demand for vehicles due to the cars program  left inventories in extremely short supply 
popular vehicles such as ram pickup trucks and four door jeep wranglers were not available in sufficient quantities to match consumer demand 
additionally  chrysler has continued to experience declining market share in north america  providing fewer retail sales opportunities for our stores 
we believe the inventory shortages will be quickly corrected 
however  no assurances can be given that these issues will be contained to the near term  or that other problems related to the financial condition and product offering of these or our other manufacturers will not arise 
we have restructured our operations to align our costs with current industry vehicle sales levels 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from an increase in new vehicle sales above current levels 
we believe the actions we have taken over the past two years demonstrate the resiliency of our company 
however  no assurances can be given that industry sales will not experience a further decline  or that our restructuring plan was sufficient to meet our operating objectives in a declining market 
we continue to believe that the fragmented nature of the automotive dealership sector provides us with the opportunity to achieve growth through consolidation 
we have completed over acquisitions since our initial public offering in our acquisition strategy has been to acquire underperforming dealerships and  through the application of our centralized operating structure  improve store profitability 
we believe the current economic environment provides us with attractive acquisition opportunities 
additionally  our management team possesses substantial experience  with our key management executives having an average of over years experience in automotive retailing  and has demonstrated the ability to profitably operate stores and successfully integrate acquisitions 
manufacturer information historically  manufacturers have offered incentives on new vehicle sales through a combination of repricing strategies  rebates  lease programs  early lease cancellation programs and low interest rate loans to consumers 
through the first half of  this strategy continued 
however  in response to tightening in credit markets  we have seen a shift away from leasing and subsidized financing to dealer and consumer rebates and repricing strategies 
in  manufacturers reduced the number of vehicles being produced  including an idling of production at both chrysler and gm  to better match consumer demand 
as a result of this  as well as the weaker financial condition of manufacturers  fewer incentives were offered  and demand for vehicles declined 
consumers who had grown accustomed to large rebates to subsidize negative equity in their automotive loans were prevented from purchasing new cars  and demand for other models traditionally dependent on rebates to incentivize purchases was relatively weak 

table of contents in the second half of  financing companies such as banks and manufacturer captives gradually relaxed lending terms as used vehicle prices improved and defaults did not dramatically increase 
this increased support allowed more customers with lower credit scores to access auto loans than in late and early in the fourth quarter of  chrysler dramatically cut the level of both marketing and rebates on its vehicles  particularly as they began to re brand their cars to reflect the new identity of the company 
these reductions in dealer support  coupled with short supplies of vehicles  particularly of high demand models  impacted our operating results at the end of while we believe this to be a temporary issue that will be quickly corrected  no assurances can be provided that support levels and an improved supply of attractive vehicles will be adequate to reach previous sales levels 
reclassification of stores previously classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of  our management team re evaluated the decision to continue to classify certain stores as held for sale in light of the then current market conditions  prospects for economic recovery  improved company wide and individual store operating performance and overall capital needs 
specific factors taken into consideration were as follows a lack of available credit continued to prove challenging to prospective purchasers of our stores 
one of the primary problems was the lack of vehicle inventory floorplan financing  which is a basic requirement of the franchise agreement 
even for prospective purchasers with existing floorplan financing  obtaining mortgage financing on dealership real estate or committing to other significant capital investment proved exceedingly difficult 
continued economic uncertainty  including increasing unemployment  resulting in low consumer confidence and a prolonged reluctance to purchase big ticket items such as automobiles 
the dramatically decreased pool of potential purchasers further extended our store disposition time line 
the absence of qualified buyers reduced expected proceeds to levels significantly below the range of what we considered to be reasonable 
a restructuring of store operations in and accelerated in aligned our costs with current industry vehicle sales levels  and enhanced our liquidity position 
this restructuring improved operational performance at all locations  including those slated for divestiture 
improved operating performance at the stores held for sale  even on a constant valuation multiple  increased expected selling prices  which proved unobtainable given market conditions 
the reorganization of chrysler and gm resulted in the closure of four domestic stores that we had not selected for divestiture 
one of the original considerations for the restructuring we initiated in involved diversifying our portfolio to reduce dependence on domestic manufacturers  particularly chrysler and gm 
the unexpected closure of locations not selected for disposition accelerated this portfolio diversification and made some divestitures less critical 
throughout and  we generated cash through asset sales  mortgage financing and operational cash flows 
in  we retired our outstanding convertible notes as they matured 
also  in late  we completed a follow on equity offering raising approximately million 
we extended the maturity on our credit facility into late these actions reduced the immediate need for liquidity to ensure our ongoing operations and eliminated the need to dispose of assets to raise cash 
based on these factors  in the fourth quarter of  circumstances previously considered unlikely were deemed to have occurred  and our management team concluded that we no longer were committed to sell certain stores 
therefore  we no longer met the criteria necessary to continue to classify the stores as held for sale 
assets and related liabilities associated with stores were subsequently reclassified out of assets held for sale 
their associated results of operations were retrospectively reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations for all periods presented 

table of contents certain locations we had closed in and continued to have assets  primarily real estate  classified as held for sale 
given the evaluation of overall market conditions  including commercial real estate  and our improved liquidity  we reclassified seven properties where operations had ceased to held and used in the fourth quarter of impairment charges associated with these assets were reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations as a component of other asset impairment for all periods presented 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management 
while we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to assets held for sale  indefinite lived intangible assets  long lived assets  deferred tax assets  service contracts and other insurance contracts  and lifetime oil change and workers compensation self insurance 
we also have other key accounting policies for valuation of accounts receivable  expense accruals and revenue recognition 
however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable 
however  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
classification and valuation of assets and related liabilities held for sale an asset or disposal group  comprising of assets and related liabilities of a store expected to be disposed of in one transaction  is evaluated to determine if it meets the criteria for classification as held for sale 
if the required criteria are met  the asset or disposal group is reclassified to held for sale 
at each period end  we evaluate whether the criteria for continued classification as held for sale are met for each asset and disposal group 
the evaluation of these criteria involves judgment  including the period required to complete the disposition and the likelihood the plan for disposition will change 
the results of operations of our stores that have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale are reported in discontinued operations if the operations of the stores have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction  and we will not have significant continuing involvement in its operations after its disposal 
when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale  it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the fair value of a disposal group is determined for the group in the aggregate 
an impairment is recorded when the carrying amount of an asset or disposal group exceeds its fair value 

table of contents we utilize historical experience  current asset purchase agreements  feedback from prospective buyers and third party broker estimates of value to determine the proceeds we expect to receive for a disposal group 
for the real property component of a disposal group  we also consider fair value estimates based on a methodology utilizing gross profit generated by the disposal group in comparison to the percentage of average rent to gross profit for comparable asset groups elsewhere in the organization 
a future decline in store performance  changes in market conditions for commercial real estate  or the potential insolvency of a manufacturer could reduce the proceeds that will be received for the disposal group 
additionally  if disposal groups related to operations which are subsequently closed  the remaining assets  such as real estate and equipment  would need to be sold in the open market 
this could reduce the proceeds that will be received for the assets  as their highest and best use is predominantly as an operating new vehicle dealership 
any reduction in the expected proceeds for the eventual disposition of our assets held for sale could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   two stores were classified as held for sale 
both are gm stores that have been classified as held for sale for less than twelve months  and we believe it is probable that their divestiture will be completed  as they are currently under contract to be sold 
assets held for sale at december  included million in vehicle inventory and million in property and equipment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
indefinite lived intangible assets we are required to test our indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of franchise rights  for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we have determined that the appropriate unit of accounting for testing franchise rights for impairment is on an individual store basis 
we estimate the fair value of our franchise rights primarily using a discounted cash flow dcf model 
the forecasted cash flows used in the dcf model contain inherent uncertainties  including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates  margins  general operating expenses  and cost of capital 
we use primarily internally developed forecasts and business plans to estimate the future cash flows that each franchise will generate 
we have determined that only certain cash flows of the store are directly attributable to the franchise rights 
we estimate the appropriate interest rate to discount future cash flows to their present value equivalent taking into consideration factors such as a risk free rate  a beta  an equity risk premium  a small stock risk premium  and a store specific risk premium 
we also use third party brokers estimates to assist us in determining the fair value of our franchise rights  which are developed using marketplace data related to current actual transactions involving franchise rights 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that our franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of the related underlying business 
a future decline in store performance  change in projected growth rates  or margin assumptions and changes in discount rates could result in a potential impairment of one or more of our franchise rights  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
furthermore  in the event that a manufacturer is unable to remain solvent  we may be required to record a partial or total impairment on the remaining franchise value 
as of december   we had domestic franchise value totaling million and total franchise value of million 
as a result of the reorganization in bankruptcy of both chrysler and gm  we evaluated our franchise value rights for impairment in the second quarter of we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of no impairment charges were recorded based on our tests 
with the decision to reclassify certain assets from held for sale  impairment charges in the amount of million related to franchise value recorded while classified in held for sale have been reclassified to continuing operations 

table of contents in the second quarter of  based on our decision to dispose of approximately of our stores  an adverse change in the business climate  our reduced earnings and cash flow forecast and a significant decline in our market capitalization  we determined that our franchise value required an interim impairment test 
as a result of this impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
additionally  we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of no additional impairment charges were recorded based on the results of our annual impairment test 
with the decision to reclassify certain assets from held for sale  impairment charges in the amount of million related to franchise value recorded while in held for sale have been reclassified to continuing operations 
long lived assets we estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
a store is evaluated for recoverability if it has an operating loss in the current year and one of the prior two years 
if it meets this criterion  we estimate the projected undiscounted cash flows for each asset group based on internally developed forecasts 
if the undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the asset group  we determine the fair value of the asset group based on additional market data  including recent experience in selling similar assets 
we hold certain property for future development or investment purposes 
if a triggering event is deemed to have occurred  we evaluate this property for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value based on listing price less costs to sell and other market data including similar property that is for sale or has been recently sold  to the current carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the estimated fair value  an impairment is recorded 
although we believe our property and equipment and assets held and used are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
a future decline in store performance  change in projected growth rates  and changes in other margin assumptions could result in an impairment of long lived asset groups  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
currently  of our long lived assets are associated with stores operating domestic franchises and of our long lived assets are associated with corporate operations and stores operating import luxury franchises 
a continued decline in the commercial real estate market could result in a potential impairment of certain investment properties not currently used in operations 
due to the adverse change in the business climate  our reduced earnings and cash flow forecast  we performed impairment testing on long lived assets in both and as a result  we recorded the following impairments year ended december  long lived assets other assets impairments within selling  general and administrative total asset impairments see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
deferred tax assets as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
the principal components of our deferred tax assets are related to goodwill  allowances and accruals  deferred revenue and cancellation reserves 
the principal components of our deferred tax liabilities are related to depreciation on property and equipment  and inventories 

table of contents we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  and our projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
at december   we have not recorded any valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
if we are unable to meet the projected taxable income levels utilized in our analysis  and depending on the availability of feasible tax planning strategies  we might record a valuation allowance on a portion or all of our deferred tax assets in the future 
in the event that a manufacturer is unable to remain solvent  our operations may be impacted and we might record a valuation allowance on a portion or all of the deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
service contract and other insurance contracts we receive commissions from the sale of vehicle service contracts and certain other insurance contracts 
the contracts are sold through an unrelated third party  but we may be charged back for a portion of the commissions in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we sell these contracts on a straight commission basis  in addition  we may also participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as income upon receipt 
we record commissions at the time of sale of the vehicles  net of an estimated liability for future charge backs 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with estimated lives of the applicable contracts 
if future cancellations are different than expected  we could have additional expense or income related to the cancellations in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december  and  the reserve for future cancellations totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
a increase in expected cancellations would result in an additional reserve of approximately million 
lifetime oil change self insurance in march  we assumed from a third party the obligation to provide future lifetime oil service for a pool of existing contracts and began to self insure the majority of the lifetime oil contracts we sell 
payments we receive upon sale of the lifetime oil contracts are deferred and recognized in revenue over the expected life of the service agreement to best match the expected timing of the costs to be incurred to perform the service 
we estimate the timing and amount of future costs for claims and cancellations related to our lifetime oil contracts using historical experience rates and estimated future costs 
if our estimates of future costs to perform under the contracts exceed the existing deferred revenue  we record a charge in the statement of operations 
we perform our loss contingency analysis separately for the pool of assumed contracts and the pool of self insured contracts sold starting in march at december   we recorded a charge of million for expected costs in excess of revenue 
table of contents deferred related to the pool of assumed contracts 
any changes in assumptions about future costs expected to be incurred to service contracts could result in the recognition of additional charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
a change in expected claims costs per contract for the assumed pool of contracts would result in additional reserves of approximately million 
a change in expected claims per contract for the self insured sold contracts would not require any reserve 
at december   the remaining deferred revenue related to the assumed obligation and the new self insured sold contracts was million and million  respectively 
workers compensation self insurance we self insure a portion of our workers compensation insurance 
workers compensation insurance premiums are determined under a five year retrospective cost policy with our insurance carrier  whereby premium cost depends on claims experience 
we accrue premiums based on our historical experience rating and number of employees  although the actual claims can be something greater or less than the historical experience  which could cause our estimated liability to either be under or over accrued 
premiums are based on actual claims plus an insurance component 
we have a maximum exposure to claims in a given year  at which point additional claims are paid by the insurance carrier 
any changes in assumptions and claim experience could result in the recognition of additional charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results from operations 
at december  and  the workers compensation reserve totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
a increase in claims experience would result in additional workers compensation reserves of approximately million

for example  a store acquired in june would be included in same store operating data beginning in july  after its first full complete comparable month of operation 
thus  operating results for same store comparisons would include only the periods of july through december of both comparable years 
floorplan assistance is provided by manufacturers to specifically support store financing of new vehicle inventory 
under accounting standards  floorplan assistance is recorded as a component of new vehicle gross profit when the specific vehicle is sold 
however  as manufacturers provide this assistance to offset inventory carrying costs  we believe a comparison of floorplan interest expense to floorplan assistance can be used to evaluate the efficiency of our new vehicle sales relative to stocking levels 
the following table details the carrying costs for new vehicles and includes new and program vehicle floorplan interest net of floor plan assistance earned 
year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease floorplan interest expense new vehicles floorplan assistance included in cost of sales net new vehicle carrying costs year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease floorplan interest expense new vehicles floorplan assistance included in cost of sales net new vehicle carrying costs results of continuing operations for the year ended december   we realized a reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
for the years ended december  and  we realized a reported net loss of million  or per diluted share  and a reported net income of million  or per diluted share  respectively 
pro forma reconciliations due to the non cash charges related to asset impairments  reserve adjustments recorded and gains on extinguishment of debt  we are providing our results of operations excluding these items 
we believe that each of the non gaap financial measures provided improves the transparency of our disclosure  by presenting our results that exclude the impact of certain items that affect their period to period comparability 

table of contents the following table reconciles certain reported gaap income loss amounts per the statements of operations to the comparable non gaap income loss amounts year ended december  net income loss diluted net income loss per share continuing operations as reported asset impairments reserve adjustments gain on extinguishment of debt adjusted discontinued operations as reported impairments and disposal gain loss adjusted consolidated operations as reported adjusted the following further discusses the results of our operations in  and new vehicle revenues year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit within our business lines  new vehicle sales have been impacted most severely by the current recessionary environment 
weak consumer confidence and a lack of available credit have reduced demand for new vehicles 
the third quarter of experienced incremental improvement as a result of the cars program  which provided government sponsored rebates for consumers who elected to purchase a new vehicle with improved fuel economy 
throughout  chrysler experienced declining market share  from approximately at the beginning of the year to approximately at the end of the year 
given our significant exposure to chrysler stores  our new vehicle sales levels were impacted as competing brands commanded more of the overall market 
also in the fourth quarter of  a shortage of available chrysler product negatively impacted new vehicle sales levels 
the decline in new vehicle sales  excluding fleet  in compared to was primarily a result of the retail environment  but was exacerbated by our heavier domestic automaker exposure 
through the second quarter of  increasing gas prices pushed consumer demand towards smaller  more fuel efficient vehicles 
as gas prices decreased in the second half of  demand for heavier trucks and suvs returned 
however  this trend was more than offset by a decline in the overall macroeconomic 
table of contents environment  as the majority of automakers experienced double digit declines in sales when compared to the prior year 
the average price of new vehicles sold in increased slightly over the average prices for  but the number of vehicles sold was significantly lower 
vehicle prices increased in compared to due to a higher average invoice cost and also due to a shift away from the volume based strategy we adopted in prior years 
used vehicle revenues year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease retail revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit wholesale revenue wholesale units sold average selling price per wholesale unit year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease retail revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit wholesale revenue wholesale units sold average selling price per wholesale unit used vehicle retail unit sales have increased as consumers opt to purchase used vehicles instead of new vehicles  and as we increase the number of lower price  higher margin older used cars we sell 
we have focused our store personnel on maximizing retail used vehicle sales and reducing the number of used vehicles we wholesale after acquiring via trade in 
as a result of the shift in mix to more used vehicles and fewer new vehicles sold  our used retail to new vehicle sales ratio has improved from in to in the average price of used vehicles sold decreased in compared to as we worked through an inventory of vehicles that was not in high demand  a shift towards cars and away from trucks and as a reduction in available credit decreased the amount of financing customers could obtain  which resulted in lower average transactions 
finance and insurance year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease revenue revenue per retail unit year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease revenue revenue per retail unit the declines in finance and insurance sales were primarily due to fewer vehicles sold in compared to  as well as a decline in our penetration rate for finance and insurance products and the impact of restrictions on the overall loan amount to vehicle invoice cost  which can impact the ability of customers to finance the ancillary products we offer 
additionally  customers participating in the cars program elected to pay cash for their vehicle at a higher rate and purchased fewer extended warranties and other ancillary products than our traditional customers 

table of contents additionally  in the first quarter of  we discontinued the transfer of the obligation related to most of our lifetime lube  oil and filter insurance contracts to a third party 
as a result  beginning march   we no longer recognize revenue related to earned commissions at the inception of the contract but  instead  defer the full sale price of the contract and recognize the revenue over the expected life of the contract as services are provided 
this change improves our cash position as we retain of the contract sales price  but decreased our finance and insurance revenues by approximately per vehicle in compared to our finance and insurance sales were down in compared to  both on an overall basis and a same store basis  primarily due to the overall decline in vehicles sold combined with a decline in the average warranty and other finance product sales per retail unit 
this decline is primarily due to the tightening of credit markets  which limited the payment to income and debt to income ratios that are required by lenders  reducing the opportunity to add insurance and warranty products 
penetration rates for certain products were as follows finance and insurance service contracts lifetime oil change and filter service  body and parts revenue year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease revenue year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease revenue our service  body and parts business was also affected  albeit at a lesser magnitude than vehicle sales  by the challenging economic environment in and declining consumer confidence has caused customers to defer maintenance work and routine servicing for longer periods of time 
warranty work accounted for approximately of our same store service  body and parts sales in compared to in  which resulted in a decrease in same store warranty sales in compared to domestic brand warranty work decreased by  while import luxury warranty work decreased by in compared to the customer pay service and parts business  which represented of the total service  body and parts business in  was down on a same store basis compared to warranty work accounted for approximately of our same store service  body and parts sales in  which was higher than the customer pay service and parts business represented of the total service  body and parts business in  which was lower compared to these changes in mix resulted in relatively flat year to year comparisons 
gross profit gross profit decreased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the decreases in compared to and in compared to were due to decreased total revenues  partially offset by increases in our overall gross profit margins 

table of contents gross profit margins achieved were as follows year ended december  basis point change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall year ended december  basis point change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall a basis point is equal to th of one percent 
during  we focused attention on maximizing retail profit opportunities on each transaction in order to offset the decline in overall sales levels 
we also continued to adjust our vehicle inventories to respond to shifts in consumer demand driven by fuel prices and macroeconomic conditions 
these factors led to improved gross profit margins in most of our business lines 
we also focused on increasing the number of commodity sales in our service  body and parts business  including batteries  tires and wiper blades 
these sales  although at a lower gross profit margin  present an opportunity to offset declining revenues in future periods 
as discussed above  the decline in revenues is attributable to decreased units in operation from fewer vehicle sales in and and lower market share by our more prevalent domestic brands 
new vehicle gross profit margins were flat in compared to as negative effects of the challenging economic environment were offset by a shift in consumer demand to cars versus trucks and suvs 
our stores typically target a dollar amount of gross profit on each vehicle sale  rather than a percentage 
as such  when the average vehicle sale price declines but the gross profit remains consistent  gross profit margins are positively affected 
gross profit margins were up on new cars  while they were down on trucks and suvs as we lowered pricing on these vehicles in order to clear out older inventory 
given the reduced number of new vehicle sales transactions  we implemented training and focused our stores on maintaining the gross profit on each vehicle retailed 
this focus helped to offset the broader impact on revenues and gross margins due to the declining economy 
the challenging retail environment also led to the declines in gross profit margins in retail and wholesale used vehicle sales in compared to we adjusted the pricing on our used vehicle inventories due to a shift in the types of used vehicles in demand in an effort to reduce inventory levels and lower amounts outstanding on our credit facility 
also  the tightening of the credit markets affected the ability of customers to obtain financing  and reduced the overall amount of credit available to each customer 
as such  customers sought out lower priced used vehicles 
this shift  which improves gross profit margins as we target a specific dollar amount of gross profit per transaction rather than a percentage  helped to offset some of the pricing adjustments discussed above 
service  body and parts gross profit margins increased in compared to due to concentration on maximizing all profit opportunities through the sale of additional service work and fewer consumer discounts and promotions  partially offset by the continued shift to parts and accessories business and more competitive pricing on service work in order to emphasize volume 

table of contents goodwill and other asset impairment charges we are required to test our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
in addition  long lived assets held and used by us and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
as discussed above  we recorded asset impairment charges in  and asset impairments recorded as a component of continuing operations consist of the following in thousands december  goodwill intangible assets long lived assets other assets costs to sell total asset impairments in addition  we recorded impairment charges on certain other assets of million and million in and  respectively  as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
after the above charges  and the allocation of goodwill based on the stores classified in discontinued operations  our remaining balance in goodwill was zero 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a includes salaries and related personnel expenses  facility lease expense  advertising net of manufacturer cooperative advertising credits  legal  accounting  professional services and general corporate expenses 
year ended december  sg a as a of revenue sg a as a of gross profit sg a decreased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the changes in sg a as a percentage of revenue and gross profit were primarily due to a lower basis  offset by cost reduction measures 
while we have improved sg a as a percentage of gross profit in as a result of better matching our cost structure with our current revenue levels  we anticipate further improvements in the future as new vehicle sales levels improve  generating more gross profit 
the third quarter of also benefited as a result of the cars program  which provided government sponsored rebates for consumers who elected to purchase a new vehicle

depreciation and amortization other  is comprised of depreciation expense related to furniture  tools and equipment and signage and amortization of certain intangible assets  including customer lists and non compete agreements 
depreciation and amortization increased million and million  respectively  in compared to and in compared to the increase in was due primarily to a million charge to record depreciation related to assets reclassified from held for sale 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated 
when assets previously classified as held for sale are reclassified to held and used  they are valued at the lower of their fair value or their net book value assuming depreciation had not been halted 
this million charge is offset by lower property and equipment balances as a result of the disposition of stores and the impairment of property and equipment during and operating income loss operating income loss was  and of revenue  respectively  in  and was negatively affected by lower revenues over which to spread our sg a  partially offset by higher gross profit margins due to a shift in revenue sources and our improved cost structure 
the operating losses in were due primarily to the asset impairment charges discussed above 
floorplan interest expense given the disruptions in the credit markets  captive finance companies have experienced increases in capital cost and decreases in availability of funds 
we have not experienced any disruption in our inventory flooring arrangements 
floorplan interest is typically tied to a benchmark rate such as libor or prime  plus a credit spread 
credit spreads have increased by to basis points in  with certain lending restrictions on aged inventories 
no assurances can be given that we will not experience disruptions in available credit for new vehicle inventories in the future 
floorplan interest expense decreased million in compared to a decrease of million resulted from declines in the average benchmark interest rates on our floorplan facilities and a decrease of million resulted from decreases in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities 
ineffectiveness from hedging interest rate swaps resulted in a decrease of million 

table of contents floorplan interest expense decreased million in compared to a decrease of million resulted from lower average interest rates and a decrease of million resulted from slightly lower average balances outstanding 
these factors were partially offset by an increase of million related to our interest rate swaps 
other interest expense other interest expense includes interest on our senior subordinated convertible notes  debt incurred related to acquisitions  real estate mortgages and our working capital  acquisition and used vehicle line of credit 
other interest expense decreased million in compared to a decrease of million related to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our debt in compared to and a decrease of million related to a decrease in the average outstanding balances 
the decrease in the average outstanding balances resulted primarily from the repayment of million of our senior subordinated notes in the third and fourth quarters of and the remaining million in the first and second quarters of offsetting these decreases was a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest in compared to of million 
other interest expense increased million in compared to changes in the average outstanding balances resulted in an increase of approximately million and a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest in compared to resulted in a million increase 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to the weighted average interest rate on our debt 
capitalized interest on construction projects totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and other income  net other income  net was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a gain in and of million and million  respectively  was due to the early retirement of our convertible notes 
additionally  a gain of approximately million in is related to the result of a binding arbitration 
income tax expense our effective tax rate was in  in and in our federal income tax rate is and our state income tax rate is currently  which varies with the mix of states where our stores are located 
we also have certain non deductible expenses and other adjustments that impact our effective rate 
in and  the effect of non deductible expenses was magnified by a decline in income due to the slower sales environment 
in  a large permanent item related to the impairment of goodwill associated with a prior corporate acquisition reduced the rate 
liquidity and capital resources principal needs our principal needs for liquidity and capital resources are for capital expenditures  working capital and debt repayment 
historically  we have also used capital resources to fund our cash dividend payment and for acquisitions 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements  financing of real estate and the proceeds from public equity and private debt offerings to finance operations and expansion 
in addition  during  and we generated million  million and million  respectively  through the sale of assets and stores and the issuance of long term debt  net of debt repayments 

table of contents on october   we sold  shares of our class a common stock in a public offering at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds  after underwriting commissions  of million 
we also granted to the underwriters of the public offering a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares to cover over allotments  if any 
the option to purchase the shares was exercised by the underwriters in its entirety  resulting in total gross proceeds of million and net proceeds  after underwriting commissions and other expenses  of million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital and potential acquisitions of additional dealerships and related businesses 
prior to such use  we are using the proceeds to pay down amounts outstanding under our working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility the credit facility  one or more flooring lines of credit or selected mortgage debt 
we have a million credit facility with us bank national association  which expires october  we currently have million outstanding under this facility 
we are pursuing an extension of the maturity date on the credit facility and believe we will be successful in this endeavor 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in unfloored new vehicles that could be financed immediately for cash 
these amounts  combined with projections for future cash flows  are expected to be more than sufficient to retire the outstanding balance on the credit facility in the event we are unable to extend the maturity date beyond based on these factors and our normal operational cash flow  we believe we have sufficient availability to accommodate our capital needs 
in addition to the above sources of liquidity  potential sources of additional liquidity include the placement of subordinated debentures or loans  additional store sales or additional other asset sales 
we will evaluate all of these options and may select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the availability and cost of capital  although no assurances can be provided that these capital sources will be available to us in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us

table of contents debt covenants we are subject to certain financial and restrictive covenants for all of our debt agreements 
the covenants restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness  making investments  selling or acquiring assets and granting security interests in our assets 
the credit facility stipulates the following financial covenants a minimum tangible net worth requirement of million  a minimum vehicle equity requirement of million  a fixed charge coverage ratio of through december   through june  and for periods thereafter  and a liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed as of december   our tangible net worth was approximately million  our vehicle equity was million  our fixed charge coverage ratio was and our liabilities to tangible net worth was we were in compliance with the credit facility financial covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants in our credit facility and other debt agreements 
however  no assurances can be provided that we will continue to remain in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants 
in the event that we are unable to meet the financial and restrictive covenants  we would enter into a discussion with the lenders to remediate the condition 
if we were unable to remediate or cure the condition  a breach would give rise to certain remedies under the agreement  the most severe of which is the termination of the agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed  including the triggering of cross default provisions to other debt agreements 
inventories and flooring notes payable our days supply of new vehicles is six days below our historical december balances and days below our december  levels 
this decrease compared to last year is a result of our divestiture activity and efforts to bring new inventory levels down 
in connection with the decreased inventories  our new vehicle flooring notes payable decreased to million at december  from million at december  new vehicles are financed at approximately of invoice cost 
our days supply of used vehicles was down three days compared to our historical december balances at december   and nine days below our december  balances 
used vehicle sales have not experienced the severe decline that new vehicle sales have 
we believe our current used vehicle inventory levels are appropriate given our projected sales volumes and the shift in consumer demand away from new vehicles

in the event we undertake a significant capital commitment in the future  we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances  construction financing and borrowings on our credit facility 
upon completion of the projects  we would anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended  although no assurances can be provided that these financings will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
we anticipate approximately million in non financeable capital expenditures in the next one to three years for various new facilities and other construction projects currently under consideration 
non financeable capital expenditures are defined as minor upgrades to existing facilities  minor leasehold improvements  the percentage of major construction typically not financed by commercial mortgage debt  and purchases of furniture and equipment 
we will continue to evaluate the advisability of the expenditures given the current weak economic environment  and anticipate a prudent approach to future capital commitments 
share repurchase plan in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather in certain of our markets and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance is expected to be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt  consumer confidence and manufacturer sales incentives  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
the magnitude of the seasonal improvement we have typically experienced in march did not occur in the first quarter of this is similar to our experience in  where the seasonally strong second and third quarters of the year were relatively flat compared with the first quarter of the third quarter of experienced an incremental improvement as a result of the cars program 
the fourth quarter of experienced a decline in sales due to both normal seasonal weakness  as well as a lack of inventory availability at our chrysler locations 
our current operational plan assumes that vehicle sales in will remain consistent with levels  and that chrysler s market share will remain consistent with levels 
however  no assurances can be provided that our plan will be achieved  or that a further deterioration in the economic environment will not occur

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory and certain real estate holdings 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are tied to either the one or three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations  therefore  expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable  variable rate mortgage notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding at december  fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall because we could refinance for a lower rate 
conversely  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
at december   we had million of long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet  with maturity dates of between april and october based on discounted cash flows  we have determined that the fair market value of this long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we have effectively changed the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of our flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not engage in interest rate speculation using derivative instruments 
typically  we designate all interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
as of december   we had outstanding the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective june  a ten year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  
table of contents effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month  effective may  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  and effective may  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month 
we receive interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum as reported in the wall street journal 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
these amounts related to our cash flow hedges are recorded as deferred gains or losses in our consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
changes to the fair value of discontinued cash flow hedges are recognized into earnings as a component of floorplan interest expense 
at december   the fair values of all of our agreements was a liability of million 
the estimated amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months was million at december  ineffectiveness occurs when the amount of change in fair market value of the swap is greater than the change in fair market value of the hypothetical derivative 
any ineffectiveness will be reflected in the floorplan interest expense in our statement of operations in the period in which it occurs 
in  and  we recorded a gain loss related to ineffectiveness of million  million and million  respectively 
in  we determined that the original forecasted transaction for certain of the de designated cash flow hedges became probable of not occurring 
therefore  we reclassified into earnings a gain of approximately million as a reduction of flooring interest expense at that time 
additionally  we de designated and re designated all of our outstanding interest rate swaps when significant changes in our underlying floorplan debt occurred with the chrysler and gm restructuring 
this de designation and re designation did not have an impact on earnings at the time  but may increase ineffectiveness in the future 
risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations  as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows
