management overview we are a global intimate apparel company with a portfolio of established  well known brands  top selling products and an iconic heritage 
we design  source and market an extensive range of intimate apparel products  including bras  panties and shapewear 
we sell our products through multiple distribution channels  including department stores and national chain stores  mass merchants including warehouse clubs  other including specialty retailers  off price retailers  foreign distributors and licensees  our company operated outlet stores and our websites 
we sell our products under some of the most recognized brands in the intimate apparel industry 
our maidenform  control it  flexees  lilyette  luleh  rendezvous and subtract are sold in department stores and national chain stores 
our bodymates  inspirations  self expressions and sweet nothings are distributed through mass merchants 
these mass merchant brands leverage our product technology  but are separate brands with distinctly different logos 
in addition to our owned brands  we also supply private brands to certain department stores and national chain stores  mass merchants and retailers 
trends in our business we operate in two segments  wholesale and retail 
our wholesale segment includes both our domestic and international wholesale markets 
our retail segment includes our company operated outlet stores and our websites 
we have identified near term opportunities for growth and operational improvements  as well as challenges  including general macro economic conditions that may affect our customers and our business 
in particular  management believes that there are many factors influencing the intimate apparel industry  including but not limited to consistent demand for foundation garments  consumer demand for innovative and leading brands  sourcing and supply chain efficiencies  continued growth of the mass merchant channel  pressure from retailers brought about by the consolidation in the retail industry  increases in the cost of the raw materials used in intimate apparel products and uncertainty surrounding import restrictions 
form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on or address these trends by  among other things continuing to launch innovative products  increasing our presence in department stores and national chain stores through the use of maidenform  control it  flexees  lilyette  luleh  rendezvous  subtract and private brands  expanding distribution of our donna karan and dkny licensed brands  expanding shapewear awareness  increasing our presence in the mass merchant channel through the use of our  bodymates  inspirations  self expressions  sweet nothings  private brands and other brands for new customers  expanding our international presence  increasing consumer identification with our brands through further marketing investments  marketing  rather than manufacturing our brands  making selective acquisitions  entering into license agreements  and developing and marketing new products that will complement our existing products or distribution channels  and merchandising  marketing and selling private brand products to selected retailers 
wholesale segment department stores and national chain stores 
the department stores and national chain stores are where we generally sell the maidenform  control it  flexees and lilyette brands 
we plan to continue to invest in increasing our net sales with department store customers  which we believe is important to our long term positioning in the channel 
there has been a trend toward consolidation of department stores 
we expect the rate of our future net sales growth with department stores to be moderated by the reduction in both the number of department store customers and the number of doors distinct locations operated by a particular retailer operated by these customers 
we have grown our market share significantly in the past several years with national chain stores 
we have customers located outside the united states that purchase our maidenform  flexees and lilyette brands 
the majority of these net sales are included in the department stores and national chain stores channel 
in  we added new customers  such as bloomingdale s and nordstrom  within this channel as a result of our license agreement for the donna karan and dkny brands 
this agreement grants us the rights to design  source and market a full collection of donna karan and dkny women s intimate apparel products 
mass merchants 
the mass merchant channel includes both mass merchants and warehouse clubs 
we intend to improve our penetration with mass merchants through the use of our brands bodymates  inspirations  self expressions  sweet nothings  and private brands 
we have experienced significant growth in this channel over the past several years and expect to achieve significant growth in the future as we are able to increase both the floor space and number of doors in which our products are sold 
we expect that both our net sales to this channel and our net sales to this channel as a percentage of our total net sales are likely to increase over time 
the volume and mix of net sales of our brands and of private label in the mass merchant channel can vary from period to period based upon strategic changes that our customers may implement from time to time 
net sales to customers in the mass channel that are located outside the united states are included in this channel 
other 
net sales from other channels  include sales to specialty retailers  off price retailers  foreign distributors and royalty income from licensees 
we supply private brands to specialty retailers as opportunities present themselves and we continually evaluate this i maidenform brands  inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued channel for opportunities 
the volume and mix of net sales of private label in the other channel can vary significantly from period to period based upon new product introductions 
we selectively target strategic acquisitions  licensing opportunities or brand start ups to grow our consumer base and would utilize any acquired companies and licenses to complement our current products  channels and geographic scope 
we believe that acquisitions and licenses can enhance our product offerings to retailers and provide growth opportunities 
we believe we can leverage our core competencies such as product development  brand management  logistics and marketing to create significant value from the acquired businesses and licenses 
on may   we entered into a new women s intimate apparel license agreement for the donna karan and dkny brands and we launched the brand in the first quarter of retail segment we believe our retail sales volume is driven by our ability to service our existing consumers and obtain new consumers  as well as overall general macro economic conditions that can affect our consumers and ultimately their levels of overall spending and choice of retail channel for their purchases 
additionally  identifying optimal retail outlet locations  favorable leasing arrangements  and improving our store productivity are factors important to growing our retail segment s net sales 
we also sell our products through our websites  www 
maidenform 
com and www 
maidenform 
co 
uk 
although we currently do not generate a significant amount of net sales through these sites  we do expect it to continue to grow 
our objectives in our retail segment are to continue to increase the productivity of our portfolio of stores through effective merchandising and focused advertising  as well as selectively closing less productive locations and potentially opening new stores in more productive locations 
even in those situations where we selectively close less productive outlet stores and do not open a new store in that region  we believe those consumers still purchase many of our maidenform brands from our other outlet stores  our websites or our wholesale segment customers that carry these brands 
historically  we have primarily sold excess and  to a lesser extent  obsolete inventories through our outlet stores at a higher margin than that achieved through other liquidation alternatives 
definitions in reviewing our operating performance  we evaluate both the wholesale and retail segments by focusing on each segment s operating income  cash flows from operations and inventory turns 
net sales 
our net sales are derived from two operating segments  wholesale and retail 
net sales from the wholesale segment are recognized when the customer takes possession and are recorded net of cooperative advertising allowances  sales returns  sales discounts  and markdown allowances provided to our customers 
net sales in our retail segment are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise at the point of sale in our stores and for our internet sales  net sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
cost of sales 
we outsource all manufacturing of the products we sell and  therefore  the principal elements of our cost of sales are for finished goods inventories purchased from our sourced vendors 
included in cost of sales and affecting our overall gross margins are freight expenses from the manufacturers to our distribution centers in situations where such expenses are charged separately 
also included in cost of sales is the cost of warehousing  labor and overhead related to receiving and warehousing at our distribution centers  and depreciation of assets related to our receiving and warehousing in our distribution centers 
direct labor  cost of fabrics  as well as raw materials for fabrics  are the primary components driving the overall cost of our sourced finished goods inventories from our sourcing vendors 
form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
our sg a includes all of our marketing  product development  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses for both the wholesale and retail segments which include our retail outlet store payroll and related benefits 
general and administrative expenses include management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  distribution  rent  insurance and legal costs 
additionally  depreciation related to the shipping function in our distribution centers and our corporate office assets such as furniture  fixtures  and equipment  as well as amortization of intellectual property  are included in sg a 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which recognizes the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of the events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the tax benefit 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are recorded 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
for more information  see the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
net operating loss carryforwards nols enable a company to apply nols incurred during a current period against a future period s profits in order to reduce cash tax liabilities in those future periods 
in periods when a company is generating operating losses  its nols will increase 
the tax effect of the nols is recorded as a deferred tax asset 
if the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the nols  it records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
additionally  section of the internal revenue code section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize its nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain existing stockholders and  or  new stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points during a three year testing period 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased to reflect both recognized and deemed recognized built in gains that occur during the sixty month period after the ownership change 
our nols are subject to section limitations

our department stores and national chain stores channel primarily consists of sales of our maidenform  control it  flexees  lilyette  luleh  rendezvous  subtract and private brands on a worldwide basis to customers within this category 
within the mass merchant channel  we sell brands such as bodymates  inspirations  self expressions  sweet nothings and private brands that are primarily dedicated to specific customers 
these brands are all sold on a worldwide basis to mass merchants and  to a lesser degree  warehouse clubs 
our remaining sales are grouped within a channel designated as other and include private brand products sold to specialty retailers and all brand sales to off price retail stores 
in addition  we include licensing income as well as sales to foreign distributors in our other channel

our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flows from operations  our existing cash balance and borrowings  if any  under our revolving loan defined below 
we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents as of january  and january   respectively 
we generated positive cash from operations of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we continued to strengthen our cash position while managing our balance sheet when compared to the prior year 
additionally  we elected not to make any voluntary prepayments on our long term debt and chose not to repurchase our common stock in further deterioration in the financial markets could lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers  contract manufacturers or trade customers and consequently  could disrupt our business 
however  we believe that  absent unforeseen circumstances  our existing cash balances and available borrowings under the revolving loan  along with our future cash flow from operations  will enable us to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
in  we expect to spend a total of approximately million on capital expenditures  driven by information technology upgrades  including system enhancements specifically related to our corporate  distribution and retail operations

borrowings are limited by the borrowing base  which consists of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory 
the borrowings and other obligations under the credit facility and the guarantees are collateralized by a first priority perfected lien  subject to certain permitted liens  on substantially all of the personal property assets and certain real property of the borrower and guarantors

operating activities 
in  and  we generated million  million and million  respectively  of cash flow from operations 
this change was primarily driven by the cash provided by operations resulting from changes in working capital 
the increase in inventory and accounts payable was a result of several factors including  among other things  new product initiatives  higher sales volume and our desire to increase our inventory levels for higher customer fulfillment of orders and to take advantage of incremental sales opportunities and meet ongoing sales demand of our products 
accounts receivable increased as a result of higher wholesale net sales and the timing of cash collections 
the decrease in cash flow from operations during was primarily due to a decrease in net income resulting from the unfavorable economic conditions partially offset by reduced expenses and a use of cash from operations resulting from changes in working capital 
the decrease in inventory and accounts payable was primarily a result of supply chain management and the timing of cash payments 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to lower fourth quarter sales when compared to the prior year and the timing of cash collections

the use of cash for investing activities in was primarily for the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the opening of our second leased distribution center 
financing activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million in compared to cash flows used in financing activities of million in and million in during  we benefited from increased proceeds and tax benefits related to equity award activity 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities for is a result of our decision not to make any voluntary prepayments on our long term debt and electing not to repurchase our common stock in as we did in contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at january  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in fiscal thereafter total in millions long term debt interest on long term debt obligations under capital lease operating leases total financial obligations other contractual obligations purchase obligations total financial obligations and commitments the interest rate assumed was the rate in effect at january  includes amounts classified as interest expense and sg a under capital leases 
the operating leases included in the above table consist of minimum rent payments and do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  or variable costs such as maintenance  insurance or taxes 
includes amounts classified as royalties  advertising and marketing obligations 
i maidenform brands  inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligations category above relates to commitments for inventory and raw material purchases 
amounts reflected in our audited consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable or other current liabilities are excluded from the table above 
as of january   our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties amounted to million before federal and  if applicable  state effect 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the schedule of cash contractual obligations because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments of these liabilities 
in addition to the total contractual obligations and commitments included in the table above  we have pension and postretirement benefit obligations included in other non current liabilities  as further described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension and postretirement plans during off balance sheet arrangements 
our most significant off balance sheet financing arrangements as of january  are non cancelable operating lease agreements  primarily for our company operated outlet stores  our corporate headquarters and our leased distribution centers located in shannon  ireland and fayetteville  north carolina 
we do not participate in any off balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose us to unrecorded financial obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that require our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we provide reserves for accounts receivable that may not be realized as a result of uncollectibility  sales returns  markdowns  and other customer allowances 
reserves are determined based on historical experience  credit quality  age of accounts receivable balances  and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
we believe that our reserves provide reasonable assurance that such balances are reflected at net realizable value 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of wholesale inventory is based on standard costs  which approximate first in  first out fifo  while the cost of product acquired from third parties for sale through our retail segment is based on the retail inventory method 
we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are evaluated by us for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances exist 
we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment exists 
at january   we had zero cumulative impairment losses 
we allocate our goodwill to our reporting units 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
to determine the fair values  we use both a discounted cash flow approach and a market approach 
in reviewing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment  we compare the carrying amount of such asset to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value using discounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset 
when the estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset s fair value and its carrying amount 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the performance of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests are subject to significant judgment in determining the estimation of future cash flows  discount rates  and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and intangible assets with finite lives  are periodically reviewed and evaluated by us when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets  this evaluation is based on the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the related assets 
should such evaluation result in us concluding that the carrying amount of long lived assets has been impaired  an appropriate write down to their fair value is recorded 
revenue recognition 
net sales from the wholesale segment are recognized when the customer takes possession  at which time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer and persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
in the case of sales by our retail operations  net sales are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise at the point of sale in our stores and for our internet sales  net sales are recognized when the products are received by the customer 
reserves for sales returns  markdown allowances  cooperative advertising  discounts and other customer deductions are provided when sales are recorded or when the commitment is incurred 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method which recognizes the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of the events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the tax benefit 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recorded 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
this assessment requires us to consider all available positive i maidenform brands  inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
accrued expenses 
accrued expenses for health insurance  workers compensation insurance  incentive compensation  professional fees  and other outstanding obligations are based on actual commitments 
these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
benefit plans including postretirement plans 
the long term rate of return for our pension plan is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing 
historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
current market factors  such as inflation and interest rates  are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
we employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk 
risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status and corporate financial condition 
the assets of our pension plan are held in pooled separate accounts and are invested in mutual funds consisting of a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities 
we use this investment approach in order to meet its diversification and asset allocation goals 
furthermore  equity investments are diversified across domestic and foreign stocks  as well as growth  value  and small and large capitalizations 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews  annual liability measurements and periodic asset liability studies 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plan in at january   we used a discount rate assumption of based upon the index fund that closely matches our expected pension benefit payouts 
at january   we used a long term rate of return assumption of based on the investment return of our pension plan assets  which are primarily in equity securities 
effective on january   the company s pension plan was frozen 
see notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the postretirement medical plans are unfunded plans 
we expect to contribute to the plans an amount equal to benefit payments to be made in which are estimated to be million 
we believe that changes in assumptions related to our postretirement plans would not materially impact our consolidated statements of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
recently issued accounting standards in august  the fasb issued authoritative accounting guidance guidance regarding how to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market is not available for that liability 
we adopted the provisions at our quarter ended october  and this adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb confirmed that the asc will become the single official source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap other than guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission for all non governmental entities 
the asc  which changes the referencing of financial standards  supersedes current authoritative guidance and is effective for interim and annual financial periods ending after september  the asc is not intended to change or alter existing gaap and did not change our accounting practices 
form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in may  the fasb issued guidance that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of financial statements 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for interim periods or fiscal years ending after september  we have adopted the provisions of this guidance at our quarter ended july  in april  the fasb issued guidance  which is intended to provide additional application guidance and enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities and additional guidelines for estimating fair value in accordance with additional guidance related to the disclosure of impairment losses on securities and the accounting for impairment losses on debt securities 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after june  we have adopted the provisions of this guidance at our quarter ended july  and this adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance to require disclosure of additional information about assets held in a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans 
specifically  this guidance requires an employer to disclose i investment policies and strategies including target allocation percentages  ii major categories of plan assets  iii inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and iv significant concentration of risk within plan assets 
the additional disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december   with earlier application permitted 
this adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we do not believe that we have significant foreign currency transactional exposures 
our net sales for the years ended  and in currencies other than us dollars were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during  our net sales were unfavorably impacted by million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
during the years and  our net sales were favorably impacted by million and million  respectively  due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our purchases are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the foreign currencies in which we have transactional exposures would be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
from time to time  we manage our interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps 
our existing swap contract matured on december  at january   our debt portfolio was comprised of variable rate debt  with no portion hedged 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would have had a million  million and million impact on our interest expense for  and  respectively 
commodity price risk 
we are subject primarily to commodity price risk arising from fluctuations in the market prices of raw materials used in the garments purchased from our sourcing vendors if they pass along these increased costs 
during the past five years  there has been no significant impact from commodity price fluctuations  nor do we currently use derivative instruments in the management of these risks 
on a going forward basis  fluctuations in crude oil prices or petroleum based product prices may also influence the prices of the related items such as chemicals  dyestuffs  man made fibers and foam  and transportation costs 
any raw material price increase would increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass our higher costs on to our customers 
inflation risk 
we are affected by inflation and changing prices from our suppliers primarily through the cost of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material in recent years 
we do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the future  volatile crude oil and gasoline prices may impact our product and freight costs  consumer confidence and disposable income 
seasonality 
we have not experienced any significant seasonal fluctuations in our net sales or our profitability
