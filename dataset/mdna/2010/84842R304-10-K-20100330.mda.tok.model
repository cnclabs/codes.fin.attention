item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates via two segments  biospherics and health sciences 
biospherics seeks to develop a single proprietary product for commercial application 
health sciences provides technical and regulatory consulting services to food  consumer products  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as providing technical support to the biospherics segment 
biospherics engages in product development of d tagatose 
the company s focus is on the non food uses of d tagatose 
our efforts have been to explore whether d tagatose is an effective treatment for type diabetes  as a prospective first in class drug candidate 
d tagatose is believed to depress elevations of blood sugar levels in diabetic patients by increasing glycogen synthesis while decreasing glycogen utilization  resulting in an improvement of blood sugar control and modulation of hbac 
the company intends to continue to develop d tagatose and simultaneously search for a sale  license  partner  or other strategic alliance to fully take d tagatose through the fda approval process and to bring d tagatose to market 
we are hopeful that as we proceed with our development efforts  incremental successes may afford us the opportunity to achieve such a strategic alliance 
the company is conducting two clinical trials under an fda investigational new drug ind application process a phase trial to determine safety and efficacy of d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes  and a phase dose range trial to evaluate the effectiveness of lower doses of d tagatose in treating type diabetes 
the dose range trial and the efficacy portion of the phase trial are expected to be completed in mid to late  and the safety portion of the phase trial is expected to be completed in early the company expects to incur substantial development costs  without substantial corresponding revenue 
the company intends to finance its development activities through the remaining proceeds received from the sale of infospherix and the november stock placement  as well as additional funds it may seek to raise through the sale of additional stock 
results of operations compared with revenue and direct costs revenue and direct contract costs are primarily related to the company s health sciences business  which started in july and has experienced a steady growth in business with new clients representing of the growth between years 
the consulting business generally provides services on either a fixed price basis or a time and expenses basis  charging hourly rates for each staff member involved in a project  based on his or her skills and experience 
engagement agreements typically provide for monthly billing and payment within thirty days of receipt  and permit clients to terminate engagements at any time 
no substantial revenue is expected from the biospherics segment until the company is successful in selling or licensing its technology 
research and development research and development expenditures relate solely to the biospherics segment and consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  and other expenses related to our efforts to commercialize d tagatose 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
the clinical trials in the use of d tagatose for the treatment of type diabetes are the primary focus of the biospherics segment 
the r d expenditures for and consisted of both the phase clinical trial and a related phase dose range study 
the increase between years is related to the expansion of the phase trial to india and the related increase in the number of subjects participating in the trials 
a minimum of participants must complete the phase trial in accord with the current protocol 
the dose range trial and the efficacy portion of the phase trial will likely be completed in mid to late  and the safety portion of the phase trial will likely be completed in early  based on current enrollment and retention numbers 
the new drug application nda could be filed as early as mid the fda review process typically takes between one and two years to complete 
approval of an nda is at the discretion of the fda 
in june  the company received the first batch of fda current good manufacturing practice cgmp d tagatose  us pharmacopeia usp grade 
the d tagatose will be used to satisfy the chemistry  manufacturing and control cmc requirements of its nda to the fda 
a drug master file dmf has been submitted to the fda and spherix has a letter of authorization to refer to the dmf in its nda 
this and subsequent batches are being used in the ongoing clinical trials 
in december  the company entered into a manufacturing support and supply agreement with inalco spa of italy 
under the agreement the company committed to the purchase of metric tons of d tagatose 
the entire purchase commitment of  was realized an expense in of this amount  was paid in  with the remaining balance payable in an additional  of d tagatose  separate from the above manufacturing support and supply agreement  was also purchased in from inalco 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive finance and other administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including facilities related expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs between and are primarily related to the expansion of the company s commercialization efforts of d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes 
these plans include the formation of regional advisory boards  with the first one held in october interest interest revenue in and was primarily derived from interest earned on the net proceeds of the sale of the infospherix subsidiary in august and from the net proceeds of our november equity offering 
interest income between years has decreased with the decrease in funds available for investing and the lower rates of return available in the market 
income tax the income tax expense is related to the release of the million escrow balance in november in connection with the sale of the infospherix subsidiary in discontinued operations on august   the company completed the sale of infospherix for million million at closing and million following a month escrow period  pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated june  the million escrow balance was recorded as a gain on sale of the discontinued segment when it was realized in november the sale was conducted to allow spherix to focus substantially all of its efforts on biospherics 
the results of operations of the discontinued infospherix segment  including the costs to sell the segment  are as follows interest revenue gain on sale of segment income from discontinued operations before taxes sales backlog the company s backlog as of december  and consisting solely of backlog from the health sciences business was approximately  and million  respectively 
the company bills for its consulting services primarily on a time and expense basis and these amounts represent estimated contract values 
further  the company s consulting contracts are generally terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by clients 
as a result  backlog at any particular time is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported 
estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
spherix s critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results  and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such policies are discussed below 
accounting for taxes and valuation allowances we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carry forwards 
these deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the company s losses and its accumulated deficit  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all the existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and subsequently  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
this guidance is effective for interim periods ending after september  we adopted this guidance for the period ended september   with no effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the three and nine months ended september  in october  the fasb issued asc update no 
 which amends the revenue recognition topic of the codification 
this update provides amendments to the criteria in subtopic of the codification for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
as a result of those amendments  multiple deliverable arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under existing us gaap 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
the amendments will also eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and will require that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a stand alone basis 
these amendments will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this update might have on our results of operations and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued asc update no 
 which amends the software topic of the codification 
the amendments in this update change the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in subtopic of the codification 
in addition  the amendments in this update require that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance 
in that regard  the amendments provide additional guidance on how to determine which software  if any  relating to the tangible product also would be excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
the amendments also provide guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software 
the amendments also provide further guidance on how to allocate arrangement consideration when an arrangement includes deliverables both included and excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
these amendments will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this update might have on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination 
the guidance establishes principles stipulating how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured under a method established by the guidance referred to as the acquisition method 
the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements related to the nature and financial impact of business combinations 
we adopted this guidance as of january  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for consolidation  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the guidance clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the guidance also requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of income  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
it also provides guidance when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
we adopted this guidance as of january  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for earnings per share  which establishes that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
in contrast  the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents that the holder will forfeit if the award does not vest  does not constitute a participation right and such an award does not meet the definition of a participating security in its current form that is  prior to the requisite service having been rendered for the award 
we adopted this guidance as of january  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for financial instruments 
the guidance requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements

in may  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  we adopted this guidance for the period ended june   and the company is not aware of any subsequent events that would require recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was million as of december  over the next months  the company expects that it will need to expend between million and million to complete the phase and phase trials and to fund its increased market development and commercialization activities 
the total cost of completing the trials is difficult to determine and can be affected by any number of factors including  but not limited to  the time to complete the trials 
the company will need to raise additional funds in to continue its operations 
any such fundraising will likely require the issuance of additional company equity securities and a purchaser of such securities will likely insist that such securities be registered securities 
in november  the company obtained net proceeds of approximately million in a registered direct primary offering 
the common stock issued in the offering and the common stock which may be issued upon exercise of warrants issued in the offering have been registered under a form s registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec in october pursuant to sec rules  the company may not be in a position to issue additional shares of its common stock in another registered direct primary offering under a form s registration statement until mid november thus  if the company wishes to conduct another registered direct primary offering before mid november  it will likely have to do so in whole or in part under a form s registration statement 
further  nasdaq rules require stockholder approval for certain stock issuances constituting or more of a company s issued and outstanding stock 
the company cannot be assured that it will be able to attract a purchaser of securities to raise the additional funds it will likely require in  that the company will be able to obtain any required stockholder approval  or that the company will be able to have a form s registration statement declared effective to complete such an offering
