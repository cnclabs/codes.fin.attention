item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended november   november  and october  overview the company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers  and manufacturers of fpds 
photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics  micro electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications 
thus  the company s selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications  particularly as it relates to the semiconductor industry s migration to more advanced design methodologies and fabrication processes 
the company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products produced using photomask technologies 
consequently  an increase in semiconductor or fpd sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales 
in addition  the reduced use of customized ics  reductions in design complexity  other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or designing semiconductors  or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or fpd designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and fpds increases 
advances in semiconductor and photomask design and semiconductor production methods could reduce the demand for photomasks 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn in that continued into  which had a negative impact on the company s operating results 
the company s operating results were also negatively impacted by the global recession  which could also impact the company s operating results 
the global semiconductor industry is driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer driven applications of high performance semiconductor devices including  but not limited to  communications and mobile computing solutions 
the company is typically required to fulfill its customer orders within a short period of time  sometimes within hours 
this results in the company having a minimal level of back log orders  typically one to two weeks 
the company cannot predict the timing of the industry s transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy  but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future  beneficially and adversely affecting its business  financial condition and operating results in the near term 
the company s ability to remain successful in these environments is based upon achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader  an efficient solutions supplier  and a company able to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure 
the effects of the worsening global economy and the tightening credit market are also making it increasingly difficult for the company to obtain external sources of financing to fund its operations 
the company faces challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness 
the company continues to evaluate financing alternatives  delay capital expenditures and evaluate further cost reduction initiatives 
the company is focused on improving its competitiveness by advancing its technology and reducing costs 
in addition  the company increased its high end manufacturing capability in with the commencement of production at its nanofab facility us nanofab in boise  idaho 
in order to lower its operating costs and increase its manufacturing efficiencies  the company ceased the manufacture of photomasks at its facility in manchester  uk  in january and at its facility in shanghai  china  in july as of december  state of the art production for semiconductor masks is considered to be nanometer and lower for ics  and generation and above process technologies for fpds  while nanometer is currently in volume production 
currently  however  nanometer and above geometries and generation and below process technologies for fpds constitute the majority of designs being fabricated in volume today 
the company expects nanometer designs to continue to move to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal  and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business through investments in manufacturing processes and technology in the global regions where its customers are located 
the photomask industry has been  and is expected to continue to be  characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to continually anticipate  respond to  and utilize changing technologies 
in particular  the company believes that  as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller  it will be required to manufacture even more complex optically enhanced reticles  including optical proximity correction and phase shift photomasks 
additionally  demand for photomasks has been  and could in the future be  adversely affected by changes in methods of semiconductor manufacturing which could affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized  such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application specific ics 
furthermore  increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers  such as direct write lithography  could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks 
as of the end of fiscal  direct write lithography has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks  as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production  and the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of alternative semiconductor design methodologies 
however  should direct write or any other alternative methods of transferring ic designs to semiconductor wafers be done without the use of photomasks  the company s business and results of operations would be materially  adversely affected 
if the company is unable to anticipate  respond to  or utilize these or other changing technologies due to resource  technological or other constraints  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities but generally command higher average selling prices asps 
the company s capital expenditure payments for new facilities and equipment aggregated approximately million for the three fiscal years ended november   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
while the company intends to continue to make the required investments to support the technological demands of its customers and position itself for future growth  its level of investment  when compared to recent years  decreased significantly in fiscal  and the company expects that its level of capital expenditures will continue at this reduced level for the next several years 
the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ics and other related products built using comparable photomask based process technologies has been  and continues to be  capital intensive due to the need to maintain a technology based infrastructure 
the company s integrated global manufacturing network  which consists of nine manufacturing sites  and its employees represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base 
should sales volumes decrease based upon the flow of design releases from the company s customers  the company may have excess or underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins  or result in write offs from asset impairments 
the vast majority of photomask units produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries of nanometers or larger for ics  and generation technologies or lower for fpds 
at these geometries  the company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the company s competitors that is not available to the company 
semiconductor fabrication also occurs below nanometer for ics  and generation and above for fpds 
in september the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds from the offering were million which were reduced by underwriting commissions and other expenses to yield net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce outstanding amounts under the company s credit facility 
also in september the company issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes which mature on october  note holders may convert each  principal amount of notes to shares of stock equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock on or before september  the conversion rate may be increased in the event of a make whole fundamental change as defined in the prospectus supplement filed by the company on september  and the company may not redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity date 
the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million  which were used to reduce outstanding amounts under the company s credit facility 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  the company issued warrants to intel capital corporation to purchase a total of  shares of the company s common stock   of which were at an exercise price of per share and  at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire on september   and were issued to intel capital corporation  an affiliate of intel corporation  in consideration for an agreement between the company and intel corporation to share technical and operations information regarding the development of the company s products  the capabilities of the company s photomask manufacturing lines and the alignment of photomask toolsets 
intel capital corporation also invested in the company s convertible debt offering described above 
in the third quarter of the company ceased the manufacture of photomasks at its shanghai  china facility 
through the end of fiscal  the company recorded total restructuring charges related to this action of million  including million related to asset write downs  primarily for the shanghai manufacturing facility whose fair value was determined by management using a market approach 
approximately seventy five employees were affected by this action 
the total after tax restructuring charge is expected to range between million to million through its completion in fiscal in the first quarter of the company ceased the manufacture of photomasks at its manchester  uk facility and in connection therewith  restructuring charges primarily for termination costs and asset write downs of million million net of tax were incurred in fiscal approximately eighty five employees were affected by this action 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges of million for certain of its long lived assets and wrote off all million of its goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of a capital lease agreement commenced for the us nanofab facility 
quarterly lease payments  which bore interest at were million through january this lease was cancelled in the third fiscal quarter of  at which time the company and micron technologies  inc the lessor entered into a new lease agreement for the facility 
under the provisions of the new lease agreement  quarterly lease payments were reduced from million to million  the term of the lease was extended from december  to december   and ownership of the property will not transfer to the company at the end of the lease term 
as a result of the new lease agreement  the company reduced its lease obligation and the carrying value of its assets under capital leases by approximately million 
the lease will continue to be accounted for as a capital lease until the end of its original lease term on december  for the additional two years of the new lease term  the lease will be accounted for as an operating lease

net sales percent change to to ic fpd total net sales net sales for decreased to million as compared to million for the decrease was primarily associated with the global recession which led to reduced demand for ic and fpd photomasks 
accordingly  sales of ic photomasks decreased by million  primarily related to decreases in both units and asps for mainstream photomasks  and fpd photomasks decreased by million  primarily related to decreased sales of high end fpd photomasks 
high end photomask applications  which typically have higher asps  include photomask sets for ic products using nanometer and below technologies and for fpd products using g and above technologies 
during  sales of high end photomasks totaled million as compared to million in total sales of high end fpd photomasks decreased by million  while sales of high end ic photomasks increased by million 
by geographic area  net sales in as compared to decreased by million or in asia  increased by million or in north america  and decreased by million or in europe 
as a percent of total sales in  sales were in asia  in north america and in europe 
net sales for increased to million as compared to million for the increase is related to increased sales of fpd photomasks of million  primarily related to increased sales of high end fpd photomasks  substantially offset by reduced sales of ic photomasks of million associated with decreased units and asps for mainstream photomasks 
during  sales of high end photomasks totaled million 
by geographic area  net sales in as compared to increased by million or in asia  decreased by million or in north america  and decreased by million or in europe 
as a percent of total sales in  sales were in asia  in north america and in europe 
gross margin percent change to to gross margin gross margin gross margin percentage decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of a year over year decrease in net sales 
the company operates in a high fixed cost environment and  to the extent that the company s revenues and utilization increase or decrease  gross margin will be positively or negatively impacted 
gross margin percentage decreased to in from in primarily due to costs relating to the company s increased manufacturing base  including costs associated with the us nanofab which commenced operations in the second fiscal quarter of  and reduced asps for ic photomasks  principally mainstream 
the decreased gross margin was partially mitigated by increased high end revenues  primarily for fpd photomasks 
selling  general and administrative expenses percent change to to s  g a expense of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in  compared with million in the decrease was primarily related to reduced compensation costs due in part  to reduced employee head count  cost reduction programs and to certain us nanofab costs reported in selling  general and administrative expenses prior to its commencing production in q 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million in  as compared to million in the decrease was related to certain us nanofab costs reported in costs of sales since production commenced in the second quarter of fiscal  and reduced compensation expense  due in part to reduced headcount and cost reduction programs 
research and development percent change to to r d expense of net sales research and development expenditures consist primarily of global development efforts of high end process technologies for advanced sub wavelength reticle solutions for ic and fpd technologies 
research and development expenses decreased in as compared to primarily due to reduced advanced development activity  principally in asia  as a result of a downturn in the semiconductor industry in fiscal consolidation  restructuring and related charges in the third quarter of fiscal  the company ceased the manufacture of photomasks at its shanghai  china facility 
in connection with this restructuring  the company recorded a total restructure charge of million in fiscal  primarily comprised of impairments of the facility and manufacturing equipment 
approximately employees are expected to be affected by this restructuring 
the company expects the total after tax cost of this restructure to range between million to million through its completion in fiscal the company is currently in negotiations to sell its shanghai  china facility 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company ceased the manufacture of photomasks at its manchester  uk facility 
this initiative began with the recording of a million charge for the impairment of certain long lived assets at the facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and includes additional charges of million incurred in fiscal  primarily for employee termination costs and asset write downs 
approximately employees were affected by this plan 
the total after tax cost of this restructure  which was completed in fiscal  was million 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy as its sales volume is dependent upon customer requirements which have become more concentrated in asia and to a lesser extent in the us this ongoing assessment could result  in the future  in facilities closures  asset redeployment  workforce reductions  and the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be predicated by market conditions and customer requirements 
impairment of long lived assets in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of its manchester  uk facility to its estimated fair value  which was determined by management using a market approach 
as a result of the company s projected undiscounted future cash flows related to certain of its asset groups located in europe and asia being less than the carrying value of those assets  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal the carrying value of the assets determined to be impaired were reduced to their fair values  determined based upon market conditions  the income approach which utilized cash flow projections  and other factors 
impairment of goodwill through the third quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a sustained  significant decline in its stock price 
as a result of the decline in stock price  the company s market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets during the third quarter of fiscal due to the decrease in its market capitalization and quarterly net losses incurred through the third quarter of fiscal  management tested the company s goodwill for impairment 
the results of the test indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to the company s goodwill and  accordingly  the company wrote off all million of its goodwill in fiscal gains on sales of facilities in september  the company sold its manchester  uk manufacturing facility for million and realized a gain of million million net of tax 
in january  the company sold its austin  texas manufacturing and research and development facility for million and realized a gain of million 
other income expense interest expense investment and other income expense  net total other income expense interest expense increased in as compared to due to increased interest rates associated with increased borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility coupled with higher interest rates and fees associated with bank amendments in fiscal the outstanding balance of the company s variable rate debt was reduced substantially during the quarter ended november  with net proceeds from its common stock and convertible debt offerings 
investment and other income expense  net decreased in as compared to  primarily due to less favorable foreign currency transaction results 
interest expense increased in as compared to  primarily as a result of increased interest rates and increased outstanding debt balances 
investment and other income  net decreased in as compared to  primarily due to reduced interest income associated with lower cash and investment balances  which were offset by increased foreign currency gains 
income tax benefit provision income tax provision benefit effective income tax rate the income tax provision for the fiscal year ended november  was million or of the loss before income taxes 
the income tax provision benefit differs from the amount that would result from applying the federal statutory income tax rate of to the company s loss before income taxes primarily due to the company s inability to realize a full income tax benefit in jurisdictions where valuation allowances were recorded 
in korea  various investment tax credits have been utilized to reduce the company s effective income tax rate 
the company s tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of ongoing and future examinations and has provided accruals for tax contingencies 
the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
the valuation allowance increased million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
pklt  the company s fpd manufacturing facility in taiwan  is accorded a tax holiday which expires in december in addition  the company has been accorded a tax holiday in china which is expected to expire in the availability of these tax holidays did not have a significant impact on the company s decision to increase its asian presence which was in response to fundamental changes taking place in the semiconductor industry that the company serves 
these tax holidays had no dollar or per share effect on the  or fiscal years 
as semiconductor fabrication has migrated to asia  in large part from the united states  the company has followed  in order to avoid a severe loss of business 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries  which represents the minority interest in earnings losses principally related to the company s non wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the company s ownership in its subsidiary in taiwan was at november  and november  the decrease in minority interest expense is primarily due to decreased net income of the company s non wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan 
the company s ownership in its subsidiary in korea was at november  and november  liquidity and capital resources november  november  october  in millions in millions in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments total net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities as of november  the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million as of november  the company s working capital increased million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase was primarily related to decreases in accounts payable resulting from reductions in obligations for accrued capital expenditures  and for a decrease in the current portion of long term borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to increased losses as a result of reduced sales 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a net loss incurred in fiscal as compared to net income in fiscal  and lower year over year accounts payable and accrued liability balances 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal decreased to million  as compared to million in  primarily due to capital expenditures decreasing year over year by million 
capital expenditures were higher in fiscal primarily relating to equipment for the us nanofab which began production in capital expenditures for the   and fiscal years were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditure payments for fiscal to be approximately million to million  primarily related to investment in high end ic manufacturing capability 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal increased to million  as compared to million in  primarily due to a year over year decrease in proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of million as compared to million in fiscal  and is primarily comprised of million in net repayments of long term borrowings 
these repayments were primarily made with million in net proceeds from convertible debt and common stock offerings  with cash generated by operations of million and proceeds from the sale of the manchester facility of million 
cash used in financing activities in was primarily related to the company s redemptions of its million outstanding convertible subordinated notes on april   offset in part by million net borrowings on its revolver 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities in was primarily attributable to the decrease in the company s payments to micron 
on june   the company and a group of financial institutions entered into a credit agreement  which allows for borrowings under various currencies 
in and the credit agreement was amended and on may  the maturity date of the agreement was changed from july  to january  and the aggregate commitment was amended and reduced to million 
per the credit agreement  the bank debt repayments primarily from the net proceeds of the convertible debt and common stock offerings  further reduced the aggregate commitment and as of november  the aggregate commitment was million 
on january  the aggregate commitment will be further reduced to million 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets located in the united states as well as stock held by the company of certain of its subsidiaries 
the cash interest rate on the outstanding debt balance is the greater of libor or two percent  plus a spread  as defined 
fourth quarter payment in kind pik interest  which accrues on the outstanding debt balance  is one percent and increases fifty basis points per quarter to a maximum of two and one half percent 
the pik interest can be paid during the term of the credit facility or at maturity 
in addition  the company entered into a warrant agreement with its lenders for five percent million shares of its common stock 
forty percent of the warrants were exercisable upon issuance  with twenty percent increments exercisable after october   april   and october  at an exercise price of per share 
approximately  warrants were exercised since the warrants were issued 
provisions which allow the company to cancel up to sixty percent of the outstanding warrants by early payment of defined amounts of the amended credit facility were effectuated during the fourth fiscal quarter of and  as of the end of fiscal  million of these warrants remained outstanding and exercisable 
the warrant agreement also includes a net cash settleable put provision exercisable starting in may and a call provision exercisable starting in may  both of which are exercisable only if the company s common stock is not traded on a national exchange or if its credit facility  which matures on january   is not paid in full by another financing facility new credit facility  debt and or equity securities  or capital contributions or with other funds 
as a result of the aforementioned net cash settleable put provisions  the warrants were recorded as a liability included in other liabilities during the quarter ended august  and are subsequently being reported at their fair value 
in conjunction with the credit facility discussed above  the company also entered into a term loan agreement in the us dated june  with an aggregate commitment of million 
the term loan has the same interest rate terms  maturity date and covenants as the credit facility discussed above 
in june  the company borrowed million under the term loan and used the proceeds of this facility to repay the remaining outstanding balances of its foreign loans in china 
under the terms of the term loan agreement  million is due on january  and the remaining balance is due by january  it is the company s intention to pay the million due on january  by utilizing funds available under its credit facility and  therefore  the company has classified the million as a long term borrowing as of november  the credit facility s financial covenants include  among other items as defined a senior leverage ratio  total leverage ratio  minimum fixed charge ratio  maximum capital expenditures limitation  and a six month minimum ebitda covenant 
cash received as a result of certain defined events is required to be used to pay down the outstanding loan balance and reduce the available commitment of the credit facility by the same amount 
in addition  the credit facility requires minimum unrestricted cash balances  as defined  at the end of each quarter 
should the company default on any of its long term borrowings  a cross default would occur on its other long term borrowings  unless amended or waived 
on september  the company sold  through a public offering  million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes which mature on october  note holders may convert each  principal amount of notes to shares of stock equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock on or before september  the conversion rate may be increased in the event of a make whole fundamental change as defined in the prospectus supplement and the company may not redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity date 
the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million  which were used to reduce outstanding amounts under the company s credit facility 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  on september  the company also sold  through a public offering  approximately million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds from the offering were million which were reduced by underwriting commissions and other expenses to yield net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce outstanding amounts under the company s credit facility 
net proceeds of the company s convertible debt and common stock offerings of approximately million  cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of the manchester  uk facility of million were used to reduce the amount of borrowings under the credit facility from million to its november  balance of million  which included the above mentioned pik interest 
as of november   the company s available credit under its credit facility was million of which million was borrowed and million was unused and available 
all borrowings under the credit facility are due on january  on may   the company entered into a new lease agreement with micron the lessor for the us nanofab 
under the provisions of the new lease agreement  quarterly lease payments were reduced and  as compared to the prior lease agreement  resulted in cash savings for the company of approximately million in fiscal the company s liquidity is highly dependent on its sales volume  cash conversion cycle  and the timing of its capital expenditures  as it operates in a high fixed cost environment 
depending on conditions in the ic semiconductor and fpd market  the company s cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash may not be adequate to meet its current and long term needs for capital expenditures  operations and debt repayments 
historically  in certain years the company has used external financing to fund these needs 
due to conditions in the credit markets  some financing instruments used by the company in the past may not be currently available to it 
the company is evaluating alternatives to increase its capital  delaying capital expenditures and evaluating further cost reduction initiatives 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to it on commercially favorable terms should its capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash  and cash available under its credit facility 
at november   the company had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately million  which include approximately million related to capital expenditures  primarily for investment in high end ic manufacturing capability 
the company intends to use its working capital and cash generated from operations to finance its capital expenditures 
cash requirements the company s cash requirements in fiscal will be primarily to fund operations  including capital spending and debt service 
the company believes that its cash on hand  cash generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next months 
the company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed its cash available from operations  existing cash  and cash available under its credit facility 
contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies the company s future contractual obligations as of november  payments due total less than year years years more than years long term borrowings operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations interest total as of november   the company had recorded an accrual for tax contingencies of million which was not included in the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments relating to such liabilities  and it was not practical to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period when such liabilities might be paid 
off balance sheet arrangements under the operating agreement relating to the mp mask joint venture  through may   the company may be required to make additional capital contributions to the joint venture of up to a maximum amount as defined in the operating agreement 
through the end of fiscal year  the company has contributed million to the joint venture  and has received two distributions from the joint venture totaling million 
stock based compensation total stock based compensation expense for the year ended november  was million  as compared to million for the year ended november   substantially all of which is in selling  general and administrative expenses 
no compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory  and no income tax benefit has been recorded 
as of november   total unrecognized compensation cost of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average amortization period of years 
business outlook a majority of the company s revenue growth has come from  and is expected to continue to come from  the asian region as customers increase their use of manufacturing foundries located outside of north america and europe 
additional revenue growth is also anticipated from north america and europe as a result of utilizing technology licensed under the company s technology license with micron 
the company s korean and taiwanese operations are non wholly owned subsidiaries  therefore a portion of earnings generated at each location is allocated to the minority shareholders 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy and monitor its market capitalization  sales volume and related cash flows from operations 
this ongoing assessment could result in future facilities closures  asset redeployments  additional impairments of intangible or long lived assets  workforce reductions  or the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be based on market conditions and customer requirements 
the company s future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained in this filing involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
while various risks and uncertainties have been discussed  a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
application of critical accounting procedures the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant accounting estimates include those used in the testing of long lived assets for potential impairment  and those used in developing income tax provisions  allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory valuation allowances  restructuring reserves and valuation models 
the company s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time they are made 
changes in accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results reported by the company may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period in which they are determined 
fair value of financial instruments the fair values of the company s short term and long term investments and its convertible senior notes are estimated by management based upon reference to quoted market prices and other available market information 
the fair values of the company s cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  certain other current assets and current liabilities  and variable rate borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short term maturities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company records derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the company does not engage in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of operations  or as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  among other criteria  the derivative must be a hedge of an interest rate  price  foreign currency exchange rate  or credit risk  expected to be highly effective at the inception of the hedge and be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item during the term of the hedge  and formally documented at the inception of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of  and during the term of each hedge 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  except as explained below under impairment of long lived assets  are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance  as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature are charged to operations as incurred  while those which improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods 
the company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property  plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn  plant closures  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of a technology license agreement  a supply agreement  acquisition related intangibles  and prior to july   goodwill 
these assets  except as explained below  are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis or another method that more fairly represents the utilization of the assets 
the future economic benefit of the carrying values of intangible assets that are subject to amortization are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows or market factors  and an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined 
the company tested goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not have reduced the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill was tested for impairment using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit was compared to its carrying value 
for purposes of testing impairment  the company is a single reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets  goodwill was considered not impaired and no further testing was required 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step of the impairment test was performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill required a valuation of the reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of its goodwill  goodwill was deemed impaired and was written down to the extent of the difference 
in connection with the company s latest test  the company wrote off all of its million of goodwill in its third fiscal quarter of impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the assets 
the carrying values of the assets determined to be impaired are reduced to their estimated fair values 
fair values of the impaired assets would generally be determined using a market or income approach 
investment in joint venture investments in joint ventures over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence and that  in general  are at least percent owned are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income loss of the joint venture 
an impairment loss would be recognized whenever a decline in the value of such an investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in judging other than temporary  the company would consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investment  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the investee  and the company s longer term intent of retaining the investment in the investee 
income taxes the income tax provision benefit is computed on the basis of the various tax jurisdictions income or loss before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required if realization is not likely by considering future market growth  forecasted operations  future taxable income  and the amounts of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate 
current income tax exposure is identified and temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and financial reporting purposes are assessed 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not more likely than not 
accordingly  income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations are impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recording a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in its tax returns 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company uses judgment when estimating the effect on revenue of discounts and product warranty obligations  both of which are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
warranties and other post shipment obligations for a day period  the company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specification 
however  the company s liability is limited to repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option 
the company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment 
accordingly  customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant 
however  the company records a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated warranty returns based on historical experience 
the company s specific return policies include accepting returns for products with defects  or products that have not been produced to precise customer specifications 
at the time of revenue recognition  a liability is established for these items 
sales taxes the company presents it revenues in the consolidated statements of operations net of sales taxes  if any excluded from revenues 
stock based compensation the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment primarily codified under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc on october   using the modified prospective method 
subsequently  compensation expense is recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
the company recognizes expense for all stock based compensation with graded vesting granted on or after october  on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
for awards with graded vesting granted prior to october   the company recognized compensation cost over the vesting period following accelerated recognition as if each underlying vesting date represented a separate award 
stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
the company adopted the alternative transition method provided in fasb staff position no 
r for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation 
determining the appropriate option pricing model and calculating the grant date fair value of stock based awards requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and the expected term of options granted 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock options 
the company estimates stock price volatility based on daily averages of its historical volatility over a term approximately equal to the grant s estimated option life 
the expected term of options and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
effect of new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
which provides amended guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
changes the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
under asu no 
 the selling price for each deliverable in a multiple deliverable arrangement will  in order of preference and when available  be based on vendor specific objective evidence  third party evidence  or estimated selling price 
asu no 
prescribes that estimated selling price be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a stand alone basis  and eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
asu no 
also significantly expands the disclosures related to multiple deliverable arrangements  and is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june with early adoption permitted

sfas no 
 in addition to other requirements  requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s financial performance and  mandates ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company records derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the company does not engage in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the condensed consolidated statement of operations  or as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  among other criteria  the derivative must be a hedge for an interest rate  price  foreign currency exchange rate  or credit risk  expected to be highly effective at the inception of the hedge and be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item during the term of the hedge  and formally documented at the inception of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of  and during the term of each hedge 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations and is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates of such currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  operating margins and retained earnings 
the functional currencies of the company s asian subsidiaries are the korean won  new taiwan dollar  singapore dollar and the chinese renminbi 
the functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are the british pound  the euro 
the company attempts to minimize its risk of foreign currency transaction losses by producing its products in the same country in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency  and by managing its working capital 
in some instances  the company may sell or purchase products in a currency other than the functional currency of the country where it was produced 
there can be no assurance that this approach will continue to be successful  especially in the event of a significant adverse movement in the value of any foreign currencies against the us dollar 
in recent years the company experienced significant foreign exchange losses on these transactions in its statements of operations 
the company s primary net foreign currency exposures as of november  included the korean won  the japanese yen  the singapore dollar  the new taiwan dollar  the british pound  the euro and the chinese renminbi 
as of november   a adverse movement in the value of these currencies against the us dollar would have resulted in a net unrealized pre tax loss of million 
the company does not believe that a change in the exchange rates of other non us dollar currencies would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april   the company s korean subsidiary entered into a foreign currency rate swap contract which  under the terms of the contract  effectively converted a million interest bearing intercompany loan denominated in us dollars to korean won 
the intercompany loan was repaid and the related swap was settled during the year ended november  interest rate risk at november   the company had million in variable rate borrowings  and cash and cash equivalents of million which bore interest at variable rates  resulting in approximately million in net variable rate financial assets at november  and approximately million in net variable rate financial liabilities at november  which were subject to interest rate risk 
a change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in or
