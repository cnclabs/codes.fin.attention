today  four companies form the core of allied motion 
the companies  emoteq  motor products  stature electric and premotec offer a wide range of standard motors  encoders and drives for original equipment manufacturers oem and end user applications 
a particular strength of each company is its ability to design and manufacture custom motion control solutions to meet the needs of its customers 
the company has made considerable progress in implementing its corporate strategy  with the driving force of electro magnetic  mechanical and electronic motion technology know how 
the company s commitment to allied s systematic tools  or ast for short  is driving continuous improvement in quality  delivery  cost and growth 
ast utilizes a tool kit to effect desired changes through well defined processes such as strategy deployment  target marketing  value stream mapping  material planning  standard work and single minute exchange of dies 
outlook despite the challenges allied motion faced in as a result of the economic downturn  the company returned to profitability in the third and fourth quarter 
conditions have improved since the second quarter and management continues its efforts to foster additional growth in revenues and profitability 
as announced in the fourth quarter of  the company relocated its copi encoder production capabilities from chatsworth  california to the emoteq facility in tulsa  oklahoma 
this move was completed in the fourth quarter and management continues to work with customers to provide a smooth transition 
this decision will provide the company with the ability to meet customers needs by providing more integrated system solutions

the company has a strong balance sheet  and improved liquidity when compared with the previous year  a cash position  net of outstanding debt  that increased by approximately million in the company also maintained their position throughout of not cutting resources in electro magnetic  mechanical and electronic design capabilities  as its primary goal is to provide solutions that raise the bar with customers and provide important differentiating factors against competition 
the company s broad market diversification provides an opportunity to grow some markets even while some are flat or experiencing decline 
as certain markets are more recession proof than others  management will continue to make investments in the markets believed to be less affected in a recession than others 
one of the company s major challenges is to maintain and improve price competitiveness 
the company s customers are continually being challenged by their markets and competitors to be price competitive and they are requiring their suppliers to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest price possible 
currently  the company is producing some of its motor sub assemblies and finished products at sub contract manufacturing facilities in china and slovakia 
the company will continue to identify opportunities where production in low cost regions can improve profitability while delivering the same high quality products 
the company s products contain certain metals  and the company experiences fluctuations in the costs of these metals  particularly copper  steel and zinc  which are all key materials in its products 
the company has reacted by aggressively sourcing material at lower costs from asian markets and by passing on surcharges and price increases to customers

the company focuses on new product designs that design out cost  provide higher level  value added performance solutions and meet the needs of its served markets

it normally takes twelve months to get new products designed into new customer applications 
the company continues its focus on a one team sales force to more effectively leverage resources utilizing a company wide sales organization 
with the one team sales force selling all the company s products  management s expectation is that this capability provides opportunities to increase sales from existing customers and secure new business opportunities 
management believes the strategy developed for the company will accomplish its long term goals of increasing shareholder value through the continued strengthening of the foundation necessary to achieve growth in sales and profitability

table of contents impairment charges during the second quarter  the downturn in the global economy continued to adversely affect the overall results of the company 
the company experienced a drop in sales during the second quarter over the second quarter of  which was the result of continued sales declines in all industry sectors

non gaap measures ebitda is provided for information purposes only and is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes ebitda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by the company s management to measure the operating performance of the company s business because ebitda excludes charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings  as well as our provision for income tax expense 
for  ebitda also excludes impairment charges of  restructuring charges of  inventory adjustments recorded in the second quarter of  and net insurance recoveries of  net insurance recoveries in were  and are excluded from the ebitda before nonrecurring items 
accordingly  
table of contents the company believes that ebitda  before these nonrecurring items  provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business  apart from the expenses associated with its physical assets and capital structure 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the company s industry 
ebitda does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s calculation of ebitda  before nonrecurring items for and is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  net loss income interest expense benefit provision for income tax depreciation and amortization impairment charges restructuring charges inventory adjustments recorded in the second quarter net insurance recoveries income before interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and nonrecurring items ebitda  before nonrecurring items liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents increased  during to a balance of  at december  the company also paid down debt in by  which represents a  improvement in our cash and debt positions for during  operations provided  in cash compared to  in the decrease in cash provided from operations of  is primarily due to lower net income offset by the noncash impairment charges  changes in deferred taxes  the inventory adjustments recorded in the second quarter  along with reductions in working capital components as a result of the current economic downturn 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  for and  respectively  which is related to the purchase of property and equipment  net of property insurance proceeds from the fire loss that occurred in net cash used in financing activities was  for compared to  for the same period last year

the company s working capital  capital expenditure  and debt service requirements are expected to be funded from cash on hand  cash provided from operations and amounts available under the company s credit facilities 
restructuring charges related to the relocation of the company s copi operation to its emoteq facility have been funded  and are expected to be funded from cash on hand and cash provided from operations 
the company has a bank overdraft facility payable to a foreign bank with no monthly repayments required 
the facility had no outstanding balance as of december  the amount available under the overdraft facility was   at the december  exchange rate 
price levels and the impact of inflation the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies  lower costs of materials and surcharges passed on to customers 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees
