risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected and we may not be able to achieve our goals or expectations 
this annual report on form k also includes statements reflecting assumptions  expectations  projections  intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled uncertainty of forward looking statements and information included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our business can be highly cyclical and subject to seasonal and other variations that can result in significant differences in operating results from quarter to quarter 
for example  we typically experience lower gross and operating margins during winter months due to lower demand for our services and more difficult operating conditions 
additionally  our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  unfavorable regional  national or global economic and market conditions  a reduction in the demand for our services  the budgetary spending patterns of customers  increases in construction and design costs  the timing and volume of work we perform  the effects of adverse or favorable weather conditions  the termination or expiration of existing agreements  losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance  a change in the mix of our customers  contracts and business  payment risk associated with the financial condition of our customers  changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing and new agreements  implementation of various information systems  which could temporarily disrupt day to day operations  the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions  permitting  regulatory or customer caused delays  
table of contents decreases in interest rates we receive on our cash and cash equivalents  changes in accounting pronouncements that require us to account for items differently than historical pronouncements have  costs we incur to support growth internally or through acquisitions or otherwise  the timing and integration of acquisitions and the magnitude of the related acquisition and integration costs  and the timing and significance of potential impairments of long lived assets  goodwill or other intangible assets 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entire year 
the ongoing economic downturn and instability in the financial markets may adversely impact our customers future spending as well as payment for our services and  as a result  our operations and growth 
the us economy is still recovering from the recent recession  and growth in economic activity has slowed substantially 
the financial markets also have not fully recovered 
it is uncertain when these conditions will significantly improve 
stagnant or declining economic conditions have adversely impacted the demand for our services and resulted in the delay  reduction or cancellation of certain projects and may continue to adversely affect us in the future 
additionally  our customers may finance their projects through the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
the availability of credit remains constrained  and many of our customers equity values have not fully recovered from the negative impact of the recession 
a reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may continue to result in a reduction in our customers spending for our services and may also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels 
an economic downturn in any of the industries we serve may lead to less demand for our services 
because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries  a downturn in any of those industries would adversely affect our results of operations 
specifically  an economic downturn in any industry we serve could result in the delay  reduction or cancellation of projects by our customers as well as cause our customers to outsource less work  resulting in decreased demand for our services and potentially impacting our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels 
a number of other factors  including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve or a prolonged economic downturn or recession  could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past services 
for example  our telecommunications infrastructure services segment has been negatively impacted since mid by the slowdown in fiber deployment initiatives from customers such as at t and verizon  and we expect this slowdown will likely continue  at least in the near term 
we continue to see reduced spending in electric and natural gas distribution work under our electric power infrastructure services and natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services segments due to capital expenditure reductions by our customers 
another area of business under our natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services segment  gas gathering and pipeline installation and maintenance  has also declined during  which we believe is due to lower natural gas prices and capital constraints on spending by our customers 
consolidation  competition  capital constraints or negative economic conditions in the electric power  natural gas  oil and telecommunications industries may also result in reduced spending by  or the loss of  one or more of our customers 
project performance issues  including those caused by third parties  or certain contractual obligations may result in additional costs to us  reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
many projects involve challenging engineering  procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods  sometimes over several years 
we may encounter difficulties as a result of delays in designs  engineering information or materials provided by the customer 
table of contents or a third party  delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery  schedule changes  delays from our customer s failure to timely obtain permits or rights of way  weather related delays and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule 
in addition  we occasionally contract with third party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts 
any delay or failure by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs  or both 
we also may encounter project delays due to local opposition  which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests  to the siting of electric power  natural gas or oil transmission lines  solar or wind projects  or other facilities 
delays and additional costs may be substantial and  in some cases  we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays 
we may not be able to recover all of such costs 
failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties  including liquidated damages  and such amounts could exceed expected project profit 
in extreme cases  the above mentioned factors could cause project cancellations  and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar projects or at all 
such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers  adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts 
our customers may change or delay various elements of the project after its commencement or the project schedule or the design  engineering information  equipment or materials that are to be provided by the customer or other parties may be deficient or delivered later than required by the project schedule  resulting in additional direct or indirect costs 
under these circumstances  we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us 
we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to obtain  through negotiation  arbitration  litigation or otherwise  adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to customer requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely deliver items  such as engineering drawings or materials  required to be provided by the customer 
litigation or arbitration of claims for compensation may be lengthy and costly  and it is often difficult to predict when and for how much the claims will be resolved 
a failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record a reduction to amounts of revenue and gross profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage of completion accounting method 
any such adjustments could be substantial 
we may also be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of claims is pending  which could adversely affect liquidity and financial results in any given period 
under our contracts with our customers  we typically provide a warranty for the services we provide  guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and material 
the majority of our contracts have a warranty period of months 
as much of the work we perform is inspected by our customers for any defects in construction prior to acceptance of the project  the warranty claims that we have historically received have been minimal 
additionally  materials used in construction are often provided by the customer or are warranted against defects from the supplier 
however  certain projects  such as utility scale solar facilities  may have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that may be broader than the warranties we generally provide 
in these circumstances  if warranty claims occurred  it could require us to reperform the services or to repair or replace the warranted item  at a cost to us  and could also result in other damages if we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations 
in addition  we may be required under contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in materials we provide that we purchase from third parties 
while we generally require the materials suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we provide to the customers  if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us  we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials for which we are not reimbursed 
costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we currently generate a portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts 
we also expect to generate a greater portion of our revenues under this type of contract in the future as a result of the acquisition of price gregory  which conducts most of its work through fixed price arrangements  and as larger projects  such as electric power transmission build outs and utility scale solar facilities  become a more significant aspect of our business 
we must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed price contracts 
the actual cost of labor and 
table of contents materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated  and we may bear the risk of certain unforeseen circumstances not included in our cost estimates for which we cannot obtain adequate compensation 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal period 
our operating results can be negatively affected by weather conditions 
we perform substantially all of our services in the outdoors 
as a result  adverse weather conditions  such as rainfall or snow  may affect our productivity in performing our services or may temporarily prevent us from performing services 
the affect of weather delays on projects that are under fixed price arrangements may be greater if we are unable to adjust the project schedule for such delays 
a reduction in our productivity in any given period or our inability to meet guaranteed schedules may adversely affect the profitability of our projects  and as a result  our results of operations 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item hereof  a significant portion of our revenues is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  utilizing the cost to cost method 
this method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
this accounting method is generally accepted for fixed price contracts 
the percentage of completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined to be probable and reasonably estimatable  and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
further  a substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives 
penalties are recorded when known or finalized  which generally occurs during the latter stages of the contract 
in addition  we record cost recovery claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
actual collection of claims could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings 
in certain circumstances  it is possible that such adjustments could be significant 
we may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth 
our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by  among other factors  our ability to expand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving network needs  attract new customers  increase the number of projects performed for existing customers  hire and retain qualified employees  expand geographically  including internationally  and address the challenges presented by difficult economic or market conditions that may affect us or our customers 
in addition  our customers may cancel or delay or reduce the number or size of projects available to us due to their inability to obtain capital or pay for services provided  the risk of which has become evident in light of the continuing economic downturn 
many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control  and we cannot be certain that our strategies for achieving internal growth will be successful 

table of contents as a result of the acquisition of price gregory  our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected by risks associated with the natural gas and oil industry  such as price fluctuations and supply and demand for natural gas 
as a result of our acquisition of price gregory  our exposure to risks associated with providing services under our natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services segment have now increased due to the increase in the portion of our revenues attributable to these services 
these risks  which are not subject to our control  include the volatility of natural gas prices  the lack of demand for power generation from natural gas and a slowdown in the discovery or development of natural gas and or oil reserves 
specifically  lower natural gas and oil prices generally result in decreased spending by our natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services segment customers 
while higher natural gas and oil prices generally result in increased spending by these customers  sustained high energy prices could be an impediment to economic growth and could result in reduced spending by such customers 
additionally  higher prices will likely reduce demand for power generation from natural gas  which could result in decreased demand for the expansion of north america s natural gas pipeline infrastructure  and consequently result in less capital spending by these customers and less demand for our services 
further  if the discovery or development of natural gas and or oil reserves slowed or stopped  customers would likely reduce capital spending on transmission pipelines  gas gathering and compressor systems and other related infrastructure  resulting in less demand for our services 
if the profitability of our business under natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services segment were to decline  our overall profitability  results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from acquiring price gregory 
the success of our acquisition of price gregory will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from acquiring price gregory  including the significant expansion of our operations in our natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services segment  certain eliminations of redundant costs and cross selling opportunities with our other operations 
to realize these benefits  however  we must successfully integrate the operations and personnel of price gregory into our business 
if this integration is unsuccessful  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer or cost more to realize than expected 
because we and price gregory have previously operated as independent companies  it is possible the integration may result in the future loss of valuable employees  the disruption of our business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures  practices  policies and compensation arrangements 
furthermore  price gregory was formed on january  through a combination of hc price company and gregory cook construction  inc  both independently operated companies with separate ownership prior to the combination 
although substantial progress had been made at the time of the acquisition of price gregory  the integration of these two companies is continuing  and this integration may result in similar adverse impacts to our business 
if we are unable to successfully complete these integrations  we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of price gregory or we may be impacted negatively by the integration process  which could adversely affect our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
our business is highly competitive 
the specialty contracting business is served by numerous small  owner operated private companies  some public companies and several large regional companies 
in addition  relatively few barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business 
as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors 
competition in the industry depends on a number of factors  including price 
for example  we are currently experiencing the impacts of competitive pricing in certain of the markets we serve 
certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures and  therefore  may be able to provide their services at lower rates than we are able to provide 
in addition  some of our competitors have significant resources including financial  technical and marketing resources 
we cannot be certain that our competitors do not have or will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services 
similarly  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within the specialty contracting business or maintain our customer base at current levels 
we also may face competition from the in house service organizations of our existing or prospective 
table of contents customers 
electric power  natural gas  oil and telecommunications service providers usually employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services we do  and we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the future 
legislative actions and initiatives relating to electric power  renewable energy and telecommunications may fail to result in increased demand for our services 
demand for our services may not result from renewable energy initiatives 
while many states currently have mandates in place that require certain percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources  states could reduce those mandates or make them optional  which could reduce  delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states 
additionally  renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup 
the locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are not viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible 
furthermore  funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available  which may be further constrained as a result of the current tight credit markets 
these factors have resulted in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated and a delay in the construction of these projects and the related infrastructure  which has adversely affected the demand for our services 
these factors could continue to result in delays or reductions in projects  which could further negatively impact our business 
the arra provides for various stimulus programs  such as grants  loan guarantees and tax incentives  relating to renewable energy  energy efficiency and electric power and telecommunications infrastructure 
we cannot predict when programs under the arra will be implemented  the timing and scope of any investments to be made under these programs or whether these programs will result in increased demand for our services 
investments for renewable energy  electric power infrastructure and telecommunications fiber deployment under arra programs may not occur  may be less than anticipated or may be delayed  any of which would negatively impact demand for our services 
in addition  other current and potential legislative initiatives may not result in increased demand for our services 
for instance  certain provisions of the proposed american clean energy and security act aces act are intended to encourage electric power transmission and renewable energy projects 
however  it is uncertain whether the aces act  if enacted  will positively impact infrastructure spending in the long term 
specifically  the aces act may not result in the anticipated acceleration of future transmission projects or encourage the installation of renewable energy generation facilities  which could result in fewer electric power transmission and substation projects than anticipated and consequently adversely impact demand for our services 
it is not certain when or if these legislative initiatives  including the aces act  will be enacted or whether any potentially beneficial provisions will be included in the final legislation 
the energy policy act of energy act requires the power industry to meet certain federal reliability standards for its transmission and distribution systems and provides incentives to the industry to invest in and improve maintenance on its systems 
however  regulations implementing various components of the energy act that could affect demand for our services remain subject to uncertainty 
accordingly  the effect of these regulations  once finally implemented  cannot be predicted 
as a result  the legislation may not result in increased spending on electric power transmission infrastructure or increased demand for our services 
there are also a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals  including the aces act  to address greenhouse gas emissions  which are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
the outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could negatively affect the operations of our customers through costs of compliance or restraints on projects  which could reduce their demand for our services 
many of our contracts may be canceled on short notice or may not be renewed upon completion or expiration  and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such events 
we could experience a decrease in our revenue  net income and liquidity if any of the following occur our customers cancel a significant number of contracts or contracts having significant value  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  
table of contents we complete a significant number of non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects  or we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenue 
many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice  typically to days  even if we are not in default under the contract 
certain of our customers assign work to us on a project by project basis under master service agreements 
under these agreements  our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us 
our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us  which will be more likely if customer spending continues to decrease  for example  due to the current economic downturn 
many of our contracts  including our master service agreements  are opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms 
there can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re bid 
our business is labor intensive  and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ  train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy 
for instance  we may experience shortages of qualified journeyman linemen  who are integral to the provision of transmission and distribution services under our electric power infrastructure services segment 
in addition  in our natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services segment  there is limited availability of experienced supervisors and foremen that can oversee large transmission pipeline projects 
a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel creates competitive hiring markets and may result in increased labor expenses 
labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues 
backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits 
backlog is difficult to determine with certainty 
customers often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or release work to us  and many contracts may be terminated on short notice 
reductions in backlog due to cancellation of one or more contracts by a customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts included in backlog 
in the event of a project cancellation  we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog 
the backlog we obtain in connection with any companies we acquire may not be as large as we believed or may not result in the revenue or profits we expected 
in addition  projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time 
all of these uncertainties are heightened as a result of negative economic conditions and their impact on our customers spending 
consequently  we cannot assure you that our estimates of backlog are accurate or that we will be able to realize our estimated backlog 
our financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  several estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events  cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory  useful lives of assets  fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill  other intangibles and long lived asset impairments  valuation of derivative contracts  purchase price allocations  liabilities for self insured claims  convertible debt  revenue recognition for construction contracts and fiber optic licensing  share based compensation  operating results of reportable segments  provision for income taxes and calculation of uncertain tax positions 
actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents factors beyond our control may affect our ability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy  which may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy 
our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business 
we expect to face competition for acquisition opportunities  and some of our competitors may offer more favorable terms than us or have greater financial resources than we do 
this competition may limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non accretive to us 
acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant cash expenditures  the incurrence or assumption of debt or the issuance of securities 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  if we issue equity securities in connection with our acquisitions  we may dilute our earnings per share and our shareholders percentage ownership 
we may be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future 
as a part of our business strategy  we have acquired  and seek to acquire in the future  companies that complement or enhance our business 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully integrate each of these companies with our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
if we do not implement proper overall business controls  our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the companies we acquire and our overall profitability could be adversely affected 
integrating our acquired companies involves a number of special risks that could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  diversion of our management s attention from operational and other matters  difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies  risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities  loss of business due to customer overlap  risks arising from the prior operations of acquired companies  such as performance  safety or workforce issues  and potential disruptions of our business 
if one of our acquired companies suffers or has suffered customer dissatisfaction  performance problems or operational issues  the reputation of our entire company could suffer 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
when we acquire a business  we record an asset called goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business  including liabilities assumed  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire 
for example  in connection with the acquisition of price gregory  we recorded approximately million in goodwill and million of intangible assets based on the application of acquisition accounting 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  while intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the accounting literature provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non amortized intangible assets for impairment 
refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting polices for a detailed discussion 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow  
table of contents market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter 
if there is a decrease in market capitalization below book value in the future  this may be considered an impairment indicator 
any future impairments  including impairments of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of price gregory  and other past or future acquisitions  would negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized 
our profitability and financial operations may be negatively affected by changes in  or interpretations of  existing state or federal telecommunications regulations or new regulations that could adversely affect our fiber optic licensing segment 
many of our fiber optic licensing segment customers benefit from the universal service e rate program  which was established by congress in the telecommunications act and is administered by the universal service administrative company usac under the oversight of the federal communications commission fcc 
under the e rate program  schools  libraries and certain healthcare facilities may receive subsidies for certain approved telecommunications services  internet access and internal connections 
from time to time  bills have been introduced in congress that would eliminate or curtail the e rate program 
passage of such actions by the fcc or usac to further limit e rate subsidies could decrease the demand by certain customers for the services offered by our fiber optic licensing segment 
the telecommunications services we provide through our fiber optic licensing segment are subject to regulation by the fcc  to the extent that they are interstate telecommunications services  and by state regulatory agencies  when wholly within a particular state 
to remain eligible to provide services under the e rate program  we must maintain telecommunications authorizations in every state where we operate  and we must obtain such authorizations in any new state where we plan to operate 
changes in federal or state regulations could reduce the profitability of our fiber optic licensing segment  and delays in obtaining new authorizations could inhibit our ability to grow our fiber optic licensing segment in new geographic areas 
we could be subject to fines if the fcc or a state regulatory agency were to determine that any of our activities or positions are not in compliance with certain regulations 
if the profitability of our fiber optic licensing segment were to decline  or if the business of this segment were to become subject to fines  our overall results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected 
the business of our fiber optic licensing segment is capital intensive and requires substantial investments  and returns on investments may be less than expected for various reasons 
the business of our fiber optic licensing segment requires substantial amounts of capital investment to build out new fiber networks 
in  our proposed capital expenditures for our fiber optic licensing business is approximately million  million of which is related to committed licensing arrangements as of december  although we generally do not commit capital to new networks until we have a committed license arrangement in place with at least one customer  we may not be able to recoup our initial investment in the network if that customer defaults on its commitment 
even if the customer does not default or we add additional customers to the network  we still may not realize a return on the capital investment for an extended period of time 
furthermore  the amount of capital that we invest in our fiber optic network may exceed planned expenditures as a result of various factors  including difficulty in obtaining permits or rights of way or unexpected increases in costs due to labor  materials or project productivity  which would result in a decrease in the returns on our capital investments if licensing fees for the network were committed and could not be renegotiated 
new or developing technologies or significant competition in any of our markets could also negatively impact the business of our fiber optic licensing segment 
if any of the above events occur  it could adversely affect our results of operations or result in an impairment of our fiber optic network 

table of contents we extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and may enter into longer term deferred payment arrangements or provide other financing or investment arrangements with certain of our customers  which subjects us to potential credit or investment risk that could  if realized  adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we grant credit  generally without collateral  to our customers  which include electric power utilities  oil and gas companies  telecommunications and cable television system operators  governmental entities  general contractors  and builders  owners and managers of renewal energy facilities and commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states 
we may also agree to allow our customers to defer payment on projects until certain milestones have been met or until the projects are substantially completed  although we generally obtain some form of financial assurance to ensure payment 
in addition  we may provide other forms of financing or make investments in the projects we perform 
our payment arrangements with our customers subject us to potential credit or investment risk related to changes in business and economic factors affecting our customers 
some of our customers are currently experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the current economic downturn 
if significant customers file for bankruptcy or continue to experience financial difficulties  or if anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided or impairments of our investments 
in addition  material changes in any of our customer s revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them 
we are self insured against potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to employer s liability  general liability  auto and workers compensation claims  those policies are subject to deductibles ranging from million to million per occurrence depending on the insurance policy 
we are primarily self insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible 
we also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements  of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year 
losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  with assistance from third party actuaries 
these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate 
if we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in a given period 
during the ordinary course of our business  we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims  which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  named as a defendant in lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  workers compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief 
in addition  we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them  and  in some instances  we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third parties 
because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers infrastructure  we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on  even if our services are not the cause of such failures  and we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage  personal injury or system failure 
the outcome of any of these lawsuits  claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management s attention to the business 
payments of significant amounts  even if reserved  could adversely affect our reputation  liquidity and results of operations 

table of contents unavailability or cancellation of third party insurance coverage would increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt our operations 
we maintain insurance coverage from third party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits 
there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits 
in addition  our third party insurers could fail  suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise be unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage 
if any of these events occur  our overall risk exposure would increase and our operations could be disrupted 
for example  we have significant operations in california  which has an environment conducive to wildfires 
should our insurer determine to exclude coverage for wildfires in the future  we could be exposed to significant liabilities and potentially a disruption of our california operations 
if our risk exposure increases as a result of adverse changes in our insurance coverages  we could be subject to increased claims and liabilities that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the departure of key personnel could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and on senior management of our operating units  including the businesses we acquire 
although we have entered into employment agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our executive officers and certain other key employees  we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees  could negatively impact our ability to manage our business 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees 
our unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely affect our operations 
as of december   approximately of our hourly employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the acquisition of price gregory increased our unionized workforce  as substantially all of their hourly employees are unionized 
although the majority of the collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages  we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future 
strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue 
additionally  our collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies in multi employer pension plans 
to the extent those plans are underfunded  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the multi employer pension plan amendments act of  may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated 
furthermore  the pension protection act of added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after for multi employer plans that are classified as endangered  seriously endangered  or critical status 
for a plan in critical status  additional required contributions or benefit reductions may apply if a plan is determined to be underfunded  which could detrimentally affect our financial condition or results of operation 
we have received notifications regarding the funded status of certain multi employer plans to which price gregory contributes in certain states 
pursuant to the notifications  two plans were in critical status  one was in seriously endangered status and one was in endangered status  and in some cases additional contributions in the form of surcharges are required 
should we provide in the future a significant amount of services in areas that require us to utilize unionized employees covered by these affected plans  causing us to make substantial contributions  or should a determination be made that additional plans to which any of our operating units contribute are in a critical status requiring additional contributions  it could detrimentally affect our results of operations or financial condition if we are not able to adequately mitigate these costs 
our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons 
for instance  our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union based company 
additionally  we may increase our exposure to withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi employer pension plans to which an acquired company contributes 
for example  the acquisition of price gregory increased the number of unions in which we participate  as well as the number of multi employer pension plans to which we contribute  some of which are subject to notices of underfunded status as described above or may not otherwise be as well funded as other 
table of contents multi employer pension funds to which we contribute  potentially increasing our exposure to underfunded status  which could detrimentally affect our financial condition or results of operation 
approximately of our hourly employees are not unionized 
the new presidential administration has expressed strong support for proposed legislation that would create more flexibility and opportunity for labor unions to organize non union workers 
if passed  this legislation could result in a greater percentage of our workforce being subject to collective bargaining agreements  heightening the risks described above 
in addition  certain of our customers require or prefer a non union workforce  and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our non union labor crews were to become unionized  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
we may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to occupational health and safety matters 
our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace 
while we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure 
although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions  we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future 
serious accidents  including fatalities  may subject us to substantial penalties  civil litigation or criminal prosecution 
claims for damages to persons  including claims for bodily injury or loss of life  could result in substantial costs and liabilities  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations  our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects  and we could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities  including the us foreign corrupt practices act and other similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
while only a small percentage of our revenue is currently derived from international markets  we hope to continue to expand the volume of services that we provide internationally 
our international operations are presently conducted primarily in canada  but we have performed work in south africa  mexico and various other foreign countries  and we expect that the number of countries that we operate in could expand significantly over the next few years 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global markets  may adversely affect our customers  their demand for our services and their ability to pay for our services 
in addition  there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including  but not limited to  potential instability in international markets  changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations  currency fluctuations in foreign countries  political  economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex us and foreign laws and treaties  including tax laws and the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
these risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers or to operate our international business profitably  and our overall business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by our foreign activities 
the fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit us based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption to some degree  and  in certain circumstances  compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
further  we require our partners  subcontractors  agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they are obligated to comply with the fcpa and other anti bribery laws 
although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we  our employees and our agents comply with the fcpa and other anti bribery laws  there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our agents  employees and intermediaries 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or 
table of contents other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  detecting  investigating  and resolving actual or alleged fcpa violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 
our participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners 
as part of our business  we have entered into joint venture arrangements and may enter into additional joint venture arrangements in the future 
the purpose of these joint ventures is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the performance of particular projects 
success on these jointly performed projects depends in large part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations 
we and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures 
if a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations  including liabilities stemming from claims or lawsuits  we could be required to make additional investments  provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner s shortfall 
further  if we are unable to adequately address our partner s performance issues  the customer may terminate the project  which could result in legal liability to us  harm our reputation and reduce our profit on a project 
these risks have been heightened as a result of our assumption of additional joint venture arrangements in connection with our acquisition of price gregory 
we are in the process of implementing an information technology it solution  which could temporarily disrupt day to day operations at certain operating units 
we have begun to implement a comprehensive it solution that we believe will allow for a seamless interface between functions such as accounting and finance  human resources  operations  and fleet management 
continued development and implementation of the it solution will require substantial financial and personnel resources 
while the it solution is intended to improve and enhance our information systems  implementation of new information systems at each operating unit exposes us to the risks of start up of the new system and integration of that system with our existing systems and processes  including possible disruption of our financial reporting 
failure to properly implement the it solution could result in substantial disruptions to our business  including coordinating and processing our normal business activities  testing and recording of certain data necessary to provide oversight over our disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal controls over our financial reporting  and other unforeseen problems 
our dependence on suppliers  subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss in our operations 
on certain projects  we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services 
we also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment required to conduct our operations 
although we are not dependent on any single supplier  subcontractor or equipment manufacturer  any substantial limitation on the availability of required suppliers  subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our operations 
the risk of a lack of available suppliers  subcontractors or equipment manufacturers is heightened under the current turbulent market conditions and economic downturn 
to the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  we could experience losses in the performance of our operations 
our business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate management infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand 
future growth also could impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management  including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives 
to the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management  we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan 

table of contents opportunities within the government arena could subject us to increased governmental regulation and costs 
most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process 
as we pursue increased opportunities in the government arena  management s focus associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted away from other opportunities 
involvement with government contracts could require a significant amount of costs to be incurred before any revenues are realized from these contracts 
in addition  as a government contractor  we are subject to a number of procurement rules and other public sector liabilities  any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business 
government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
government agencies may review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if government agencies determine through these audits or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts  they will not reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs 
if government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  if the government were to even allege improper activity  we also could experience serious harm to our reputation 
many government contracts must be appropriated each year 
if appropriations are not made in subsequent years we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts 
a portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds 
we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds 
current or future market conditions  including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies  as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk  could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew  or substantially reduce the amount of  bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs 
these actions could be taken on short notice 
if our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding  our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other sureties  finding more business that does not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance  such as letters of credit or cash 
we may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all  which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances 
we have also granted security interests in various of our assets to collateralize our obligations to our sureties 
furthermore  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue or continue bonds on a project by project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds 
if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons  we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products  pcbs  fuel storage and air quality 
we perform work in many different types of underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil  some of which may contain pollutants 
these objects may also rupture  resulting in the discharge of pollutants 
in such circumstances  we may be liable for fines and damages  and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information 
as a result of our acquisition of price gregory  we expect an increase in the amount of work performed in and around environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers  lakes and wetlands 
in addition  we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture  resulting in the release of subsurface materials 
these subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
we also own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks that are above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 

table of contents in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in certain instances  we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties including predecessors or lessors for such cleanup and other obligations and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such obligations and liabilities 
however  such third party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs  and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities  or future obligations and liabilities  may have a material adverse effect on our business operations  financial condition or cash flows 
further  we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
there are also other legislative and regulatory proposals  including the aces act  to address greenhouse gas emissions 
these proposals  if enacted  could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations  additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities  or other regulatory actions 
any of these actions could result in increased costs associated with our operations and impact the prices we charge our customers 
for example  if new regulations are adopted regulating greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks  we could experience a significant increase in environmental compliance costs in light of our large rolling stock fleet 
in addition  if our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions  our reputation could suffer 
we may not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of has many requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting  including the requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
during  we continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these requirements 
as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was effective  however  there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in future years 
failure to maintain effective internal controls or the identification of significant internal control deficiencies in acquisitions already made or made in the future could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock and our other publicly traded securities  the reduced ability to obtain financing  the loss of customers  penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements 
if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights become obsolete  our competitive position could be adversely impacted 
we utilize a variety of intellectual property rights in our services 
we view our portfolio of proprietary energized services tools and techniques as well as our other process and design technologies as one of our competitive strengths  and we use it as part of our efforts to differentiate our service offerings 
we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented  or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we also license certain technologies from third parties  and there is a risk that our relationships with licensors may terminate or expire or may be interrupted or harmed 
if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights  or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us  our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced 
in addition  if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete  we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings  and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers 
as a result  our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations 
if we cannot secure funds in the future  including financing on acceptable terms  we may be unable to support our growth strategy or future operations 
we cannot readily predict the ability of certain customers to pay for past services  and the current economic downturn may negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
we also cannot readily predict the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts 
using cash for acquisitions limits our 
table of contents financial flexibility and makes us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
our existing credit facility contains significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility  including our ability to incur additional debt or conduct equity financings  and if we seek more debt we may have to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility 
when we seek additional debt or equity financings  we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all  in particular under the current volatile market conditions 
furthermore  our credit facility is based upon existing commitments from several banks 
with the current tight credit markets  banks have become more restrictive in their lending practices  and some may be unable or unwilling to fund their commitments  which may limit our access to the capital needed to fund our growth and operations 
we also rely on financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our trucks and trailers  support vehicles and specialty construction equipment 
the current credit market may cause certain of these financing companies to restrict or withhold access to capital to fund the leasing of additional equipment 
although we are not dependent on any single equipment lessor  a widespread lack of available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could negatively impact our future operations 
additionally  the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control  which will impact our ability to use equity to obtain funds 
a variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  including overall market conditions or volatility  a shortfall in our operating results from those anticipated  negative results or other unfavorable information relating to our market peers on the risk factors described in this annual report on form k 
the industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services we provide 
the electric power  gas and oil  telecommunications and cable television industries are undergoing rapid change as a result of technological advances that could  in certain cases  reduce the demand for our services  impair the value of our fiber optic network or otherwise negatively impact our business 
new or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for voice  video and data transmissions  and improvements in existing technology may allow our telecommunications infrastructure services segment customers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
our convertible subordinated notes may be convertible in the future  which  if converted  may result in dilution to existing stockholders  lower prevailing market prices for our common stock or cause a significant cash outlay 
as a result of our common stock satisfying the market price condition of our convertible subordinated notes  our convertible subordinated notes due notes have been convertible at the option of the holders at various times in the past 
the notes are not presently convertible  but may resume convertibility in future periods upon satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions 
we have the right to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon a conversion of the notes 
the number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based on a conversion rate of approximately 
in the event that all notes were converted for common stock  we would issue an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
the conversion of some or all of our notes into our common stock would dilute existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the possibility that the notes may be converted may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 
if we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash  the amount of cash payable upon conversion of the notes will be determined by the product of i the number of shares issuable for the principal amount of the converted notes at a conversion rate of approximately per share and ii the average closing price of our common stock during a day trading period following the holders unretracted election to convert the notes 
to the extent we decide to pay cash to settle any conversions and the average closing price of our common stock during this 
table of contents period exceeds for the notes  we would have to pay cash in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted  which would result in the recording of a loss on extinguishment of debt 
certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult 
the following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  as well as our stockholder rights plan and delaware law  could discourage potential proposals to acquire us  delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws  our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent  and we are subject to provisions of delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder

item legal proceedings we are from time to time a party to various lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions typically seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract and or property damages  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated
