item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a drug discovery and development company that is committed to leveraging our innovative signaling pathway drug technologies in seeking to develop next generation targeted cancer therapies 
we are building upon our experience in modulating signaling pathways  including the hedgehog signaling pathway  in our effort to develop our targeted cancer therapies 
we conduct our research programs both internally and through strategic collaborations 
our most advanced program is our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program under collaboration with genentech  inc  a wholly owned member of the roche group 
the lead drug candidate being developed under this program is gdc  a first in class orally administered small molecule hedgehog pathway inhibitor 
genentech and roche are currently conducting three clinical trials of gdc  including a pivotal phase ii trial in advanced basal cell carcinoma  or bcc  that was initiated in february and two phase ii clinical trials of gdc  in metastatic colorectal cancer and in advanced ovarian cancer  which were initiated in in addition to the ongoing clinical trials that genentech and roche are conducting  genentech and the national cancer institute  or nci  entered into a collaborative relationship that allows the nci to study gdc in additional potential cancer indications 
under this arrangement with nci  third party investigators began enrolling patients in a phase i clinical trial that is designed to evaluate dose and safety of gdc in young patients with medulloblastoma and a phase ii clinical trial to test the molecule in adult medulloblastoma patients 
a phase i clinical trial in pancreatic cancer patients and randomized phase ii clinical trials in small cell lung cancer and advanced stomach or gastroesophageal junction cancer patients were also initiated and an additional phase ii study is planned in glioblastoma multiforme patients under this nci arrangement 
furthermore  an investigator sponsored study evaluating gdc in patients with basal cell nevus gorlin syndrome also has been initiated 
our internal drug development efforts are focused on our targeted cancer programs that seek to inhibit multiple signaling pathways 
we believe that this approach of targeting multiple nodes in cancer signaling pathway networks may provide a better therapeutic effect than many of the cancer drugs currently marketed or in development since we believe that we are disrupting the cancer network environment in several additional important targets when compared to other cancer drugs 
our lead candidate from these programs is cudc  a small molecule compound that is currently in a dose escalation phase i clinical trial and is the first in class compound designed to simultaneously target histone deacetylase  or hdac  epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr  and human epidermal growth factor receptor  or her  all of which are validated cancer targets 
we have treated patients to date in this study and estimate that we will establish our maximum tolerated dose and complete this dose escalation study in the first half of we also expect that we will select another molecule from our preclinical portfolio in in july  we selected cudc  an hsp inhibitor  as a development candidate from our targeted cancer programs 
in august  we granted a worldwide  exclusive royalty bearing license to our hsp inhibitor technology  including cudc to debiopharm sa  a swiss pharmaceutical development company  
table of contents or debiopharm 
cudc has been renamed debio by debiopharm 
debiopharm will assume all future development responsibility and incur all future costs related to the development  registration and commercialization of products under the agreement 
debiopharm plans to open a phase i clinical trial evaluating the safety of debio in patients suffering from advanced solid tumors or lymphoma during the second quarter of since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  contingent cash payments  research and development funding from our corporate collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities and debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable and have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we devote substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we believe that near term key drivers to our success will include genentech s ability to continue to successfully advance its clinical trials for gdc  debiopharm s ability to initiate phase i clinical testing and advance debio into later stages of clinical development  our ability to continue to successfully enroll and treat patients in our phase i clinical trial for cudc  our ability to successfully enter into a material license or collaboration agreement for cudc or other of our proprietary drug candidates  and our ability to advance the preclinical development of other small molecule cancer drug candidates that we are developing under our proprietary pipeline of targeted cancer programs 
in the longer term  a key driver to our success will be our ability  and the ability of any current or future collaborator or licensee  to successfully commercialize drugs based upon our proprietary technologies 
collaboration agreements we are currently a party to a june collaboration with genentech relating to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor technologies  an april collaboration with genentech relating to the wnt signaling pathway  and an august license agreement with debiopharm relating to our hsp inhibitor technology 
our past and current collaborations have generally provided for research  development and commercialization programs to be wholly or majority funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional contingent cash payments if specified development and regulatory approval objectives are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaborations 
we are currently not receiving any research funding and we do not expect to receive such funding in the future from genentech or debiopharm under our current agreements with these parties 
we currently expect to incur only nominal research and development costs under our collaborations with genentech related to the maintenance of licenses 
in addition  as a result of our licensing agreements with various universities  we are obligated to make payments to these university licensors when we receive certain payments from genentech 
as of december   we have paid an aggregate of  related to such agreements 
we also expect to incur general and administrative costs associated with our share of intellectual property costs under our collaboration of the hedgehog pathway inhibitor program 
we do not expect to incur any material costs related to our hsp technologies subsequent to our entry into the august license agreement with debiopharm for these technologies 

table of contents our current collaboration agreements are summarized as follows genentech hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration 
under the terms of the june agreement with genentech  we granted genentech an exclusive  global  royalty bearing license  with the right to sublicense  make  use  sell and import small molecule and antibody hedgehog pathway inhibitors 
in november  genentech granted a sublicense to f 
hoffmann laroche  ltd roche for non us rights to gdc roche received this sublicense pursuant to an agreement between genentech and roche under which genentech granted roche an option to obtain a license to commercialize certain genentech products in non us markets 
genentech and roche have primary responsibility for worldwide clinical development  regulatory affairs  manufacturing and supply  formulation and sales and marketing 
we are not a party to this agreement between genentech and roche but we are eligible to receive cash payments for regulatory filing and approval objectives achieved and future royalties on products developed outside of the us  if any  under our june collaboration agreement with genentech 
the lead drug candidate being developed under our hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech is gdc  a first in class orally administered small molecule hedgehog pathway inhibitor 
genentech and roche are responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of gdc we are eligible to receive up to  in contingent cash payments under the collaboration for the development of gdc or another small molecule  assuming the successful achievement by genentech and roche of specified clinical development and regulatory objectives  of which we have received  to date 
in addition to these payments  we are also eligible for a royalty on sales of any hedgehog pathway inhibitor products that are successfully commercialized by genentech and roche 
for gdc  we are entitled to a mid to high single digit royalty  which escalates within this range with increasing product sales 
in certain specified circumstances  the royalty rate applicable to gdc may be decreased to a low to mid single digit royalty 
genentech wnt pathway collaboration 
in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genentech for discovery and development of small molecule compounds that modulate the wnt signaling pathway 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech an exclusive royalty bearing license to make  use and sell small molecule compounds that are modulators of the wnt pathway 
genentech paid us an up front license fee of  and funded  for research and development activities during the two year research term  which ended in march  at which time  genentech assumed responsibility for any future development of this program 
genentech has also agreed to make cash payments to us that are contingent upon the successful achievement of certain research  development  clinical and drug approval objectives  as well as royalties on net product sales if product candidates derived from the collaboration are successfully commercialized 
if genentech does not advance drug candidates generated under this collaboration beyond the discovery research stage  we are not entitled to receive any future cash payments under this collaboration 
we can not predict whether genentech will continue to pursue the development of drug candidates under the agreement or whether any development objectives for which we may be entitled to a cash payment will be achieved 
debiopharm hsp collaboration 
in august  we granted a worldwide  exclusive royalty bearing license to our hsp inhibitor technology  including cudc to debiopharm 
debiopharm has since renamed this candidate debio and will assume all future development responsibility and incur all future costs related to the development  registration and commercialization of products under the agreement 
as part of the consideration under the agreement  debiopharm paid us an up front license fee of  in addition  in february  we earned  upon approval from french regulatory authorities of debiopharm s clinical trial application  or cta  to begin phase i clinical trials 
we are eligible to receive up to an additional  if specified clinical development and regulatory approval objectives are met 
included in these future payments is a payment for debiopharm s treatment of the fifth patient in the corresponding phase i clinical trial  which we anticipate will begin in the second quarter of we are also eligible to receive royalties if any products under the license agreement are successfully developed and commercialized 
the license agreement also provides certain provisions for termination as it relates to both parties 

table of contents recent developments registered direct offering 
on january   we entered into a placement agent agreement with rbc capital markets corporation and rodman renshaw  llc relating to our registered direct offering  issuance and sale to a select group of investors of  units with each unit consisting of i one share of our common stock  par value per share and ii one warrant to purchase of a share of common stock at a price of per unit 
we received net proceeds from the sale of the units  after deducting offering expenses  of approximately  cta accepted for debio  in february  debiopharm notified us that french regulatory authorities had accepted its clinical trial application for debio as a result  we have earned an  payment from debiopharm under our august license agreement 
we expect that we will receive this payment during the first quarter of chugai to expand gdc development into japan market 
in february  we announced that chugai pharmaceutical co  ltd 
had exercised its right of first refusal for the development and commercialization in japan of gdc under an existing agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd 
gdc is being developed by genentech  inc  a wholly owned member of the roche group  under our collaboration agreement with genentech 
we believe that the combined development efforts of genentech  roche and chugai will provide significant opportunities for the development of gdc in the majority of the significant global pharmaceutical markets 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will largely depend on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate collaborators and the progress of drug candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  if any  the timing of the receipt of payments  if any  from new or existing collaborators and the cost and outcome of any preclinical development or clinical trials then being conducted 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december   together with the approximately  in net proceeds that we received under our january registered direct offering and the  that we earned upon debiopharm s february approval from european regulatory authorities of debiopharm s cta to begin phase i clinical trials  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the first half of our ability to continue funding our planned operations beyond the first half of is dependent on payments that we may receive from debiopharm or genentech upon the achievement of development and regulatory approval objectives  our ability to manage our expenses and our ability to raise additional funds through additional corporate collaborations  equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
we expect to end with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of to million  excluding any other potential payments from existing or new collaborators  for example  we are also is eligible to receive an additional payment from debiopharm upon the treatment of the fifth patient in its phase i clinical trial 
we expect that our expenses associated with the clinical development of cudc will increase  resulting in an overall increase in our research and development expenses for future periods as compared to prior years 
we expect that research and development expenses for the year ended december  will be to million and that general and administrative expenses will be to million 
these expense estimates include  to  and to million of stock based compensation expense for research and development and general and administrative expense  respectively 
actual stock based compensation expense for fiscal may be higher as the result of our issuance of additional awards as part of our planned compensation programs  consistent with past practices 
revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from our direct sale of products for several years  if ever 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from license fees  research and development payments  and other amounts that we have received from our strategic collaborators and licensees 
for the year 
table of contents ended december   each of the following parties accounted for a portion of our total revenue as follows genentech   or  and debiopharm   or 
we currently receive no research funding for our programs under our collaborations with genentech and debiopharm and we do not expect to receive such funding in the future under these collaborations 
accordingly  our only source of revenues and or cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments and funded research and development that we may receive under new collaboration agreements  if any  contingent cash payments for the achievement of development objectives  if any are met  under new collaborations or our existing collaborations with genentech and debiopharm  and royalty payments that are contingent upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon these collaborations 
our ability to enter into new collaborations and our receipt of additional payments under our existing collaborations with genentech and debiopharm cannot be assured  nor can we predict the timing of any such arrangements or payments  as the case may be 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop our drug candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel including stock based compensation expense as well as outside service costs including clinical research organizations and medicinal chemistry 
research and development expenses also include the costs of supplies and reagents  consulting  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we are currently incurring only nominal research and development expenses under our hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech related to the prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property portfolio and the maintenance of third party licenses to certain background technologies 
for each contingent payment  if any  received under the hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration  we would be obligated to make payments to certain third party licensors and recognize the related expense 
our research and development programs  both internal and under collaboration  are summarized in the following table product candidate primary indication collaborator licensee status hedgehog pathway inhibitor gdc gdc gdc advanced bcc metastatic colorectal cancer advanced ovarian cancer genentech genentech genentech pivotal phase ii phase ii phase ii targeted cancer programs cudc hdac  egfr  her inhibitor cancer internal development phase i debio formerly cudc hsp inhibitor cancer debiopharm cta accepted other targeted cancer programs cancer internal development preclinical in the chart above  pivotal phase ii means that genentech is currently treating human patients in a pivotal phase ii clinical trial  the primary objective of which is a therapeutic response in human patients 
the endpoints of this clinical trial  if positive  may serve as the basis for a future nda submission by genentech  or roche 
phase ii means that genentech is currently treating human patients in a phase ii clinical trial  the primary objective of which is a therapeutic response ie  for the metastatic colorectal cancer trial  progression free survival from randomization to disease progression or death 
phase i means that we are currently treating human patients in a phase i clinical trial  the principal purpose of which is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the compound being tested 
cta accepted means that french regulatory authorities have accepted the clinical trial application filed by debiopharm to begin phase i clinical trials in europe 
preclinical means that we are seeking to obtain evidence of therapeutic efficacy and safety in preclinical models of human disease of one or more compounds within a particular class of drug candidates 
because of the early stages of development of these programs  our ability and that of our collaborator and licensee to successfully complete preclinical and clinical studies of these drug candidates  and the timing of 
table of contents completion of such programs  is highly uncertain 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs which may affect our and our collaborators future results  including the scope  quality of data  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or our collaborators  the results of future preclinical and clinical trials  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our drug candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost and effectiveness of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our drug candidates 
any failure to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a further discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our research and development programs on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth above in part i  item a risk factors 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation expense and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  patent and accounting services 
patent costs include certain patents covered under collaborations  a portion of which is reimbursed by collaborators and a portion of which is borne by curis 
we incurred what we believe to be nonrecurring general and administrative expenses in  specifically as it related to an arbitration proceeding that we initiated against micromet  a former collaborator 
we entered into a settlement and release agreement with micromet in february  whereby micromet made a final payment of  to us in order to settle the dispute and discharge and terminate all future payment obligations that would have arisen under the june collaboration agreement 
during  we incurred approximately  in legal fees and expenses through the settlement date which will be applied against these proceeds 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates and judgments include the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition  the value of certain liabilities and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  codification topic  revenue recognition 
license fees and multiple element arrangements 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a relative performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the relative performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis and we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential  then the total payments under the arrangement  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation 
table of contents ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
substantive milestone payments 
our collaboration agreements may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort on our part is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and  a reasonable amount of time passes between the up front license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and therefore the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
in addition  the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and  as a result  any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable 
milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable of being achieved until such approval is received 
milestones tied to counter party performance are not included our revenue model until the performance conditions are met 
reimbursement of costs 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of fasb codification topic  revenue recognition  principal agent consideration  are met  the amounts are determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payments would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and therefore would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
we did not recognize any royalty revenues for the years ended december   or 
table of contents deferred revenue 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
significant judgments are required in the application of revenue recognition guidance 
for example  in connection with our existing and former collaboration agreements  we have historically recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue would be recognized 
short term deferred revenue would consist of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue  or applied against future co development costs  within the next fiscal year 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized in the next fiscal year would be classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate would be based on our operating plan as of the balance sheet date and on our estimated performance periods under the collaboration in which we have recorded deferred revenues 
if our operating plan or our estimated performance period would change  we could recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the reporting period 
as of december   we had  in short term deferred revenue and no long term deferred revenue related to our collaborations 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations have consisted of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates could change 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments were to change over the course of these agreements  it could affect the timing and amount of revenue that we would recognize and record in future periods 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  which generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and is now referred to as fasb codification topic  compensation stock compensation 
we have recorded employee stock based compensation expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we estimate that we will record approximately  to  in stock based compensation expense in  which includes approximately  in expense related to accelerated vesting of certain performance condition options 
these options immediately vest upon the consummation of a collaboration  licensing or other similar agreement regarding programs under our targeted cancer programs that includes an up front cash payment of at least  excluding any equity investment  subject to the employee s continued employment 
the compensation committee of our board of directors has determined that the  payment from debiopharm expected in the first quarter of  in addition to the  license fee paid in august  will satisfy the performance condition underlying these options as the total cash consideration received will equal  we have granted and expect that we may grant additional options in that could increase the amount of stock based compensation ultimately recognized 
the amount of the incremental employee stock based compensation expense attributable to employee stock options to be granted will depend primarily on the number of stock options granted  the fair market value of our common stock at the respective grant dates  and the specific terms of the stock options 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we used a black scholes pricing model 
this model requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price  
table of contents the expected term of the option  the grant date price of our common stock  the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividends on our common stock  which we do not anticipate paying for the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term 
of the variables above  we believe that the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
upon adoption  we were also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur  and record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest 
accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting  and recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate for each of the quarterly periods in  and this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary to reflect the actual forfeitures for the reporting period 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements for our financial assets and financial liabilities  which is now referred to as fasb codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
topic provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
gaap defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are i independent  ii knowledgeable  iii able to transact  and iv willing to transact 
gaap requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach  the income approach and or the cost approach 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts  such as cash flows or earnings  to a single present amount on a discounted basis 
the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset replacement cost 
valuation techniques should be consistently applied 
gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs  where available  and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities have been classified as level assets 
we do not hold any asset backed or auction rate securities 
short term accounts receivable and accounts payable are reflected in the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements at net realizable value  which approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
in general  fair value is based upon quoted market prices  where available 
while we believe our valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and goodwill 
in the ordinary course of our business  we incur costs that at times have been substantial related to property and equipment 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
if it were determined that the carrying value of our other long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure an impairment based on application of fasb codification topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a realignment of our research programs to focus on later stage preclinical drug development programs and de emphasize our earlier discovery research programs 
we revised our estimates of the depreciable lives on the remaining equipment currently being used in our discovery research programs as a result of two of our discovery programs ending 
in march  our bmp small molecule screening agreement with centocor a johnson johnson subsidiary concluded in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
the bmp small molecule screening program was the only remaining program utilizing the majority of our existing discovery screening equipment 
we determined that we would not fund the bmp small molecule program internally 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded additional property and equipment impairment charges of  because this discovery equipment could not be used on other ongoing programs 
we assess the impairment of identifiable long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually 
since january   we have applied fasb codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
topic requires us to perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in december  and  and determined that as of those dates our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in  and our discussion of our critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

our license revenues decreased slightly to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the prior year due to offsetting variances among our current and former licensees and collaborators 
we recognized  under our august license agreement with debiopharm related to our hsp technology 
this increase was offset by a decrease of  in license revenue recognized from the sale and assignment of our remaining bone morphogenetic protein assets to stryker corporation during the first quarter of in addition  we recognized license revenues of  in each of and upon the achievement of certain development objectives under our june collaboration with genentech 
offsetting the decrease in license revenues  research and development revenues increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the prior year primarily related to our license agreement with debiopharm  as we provided certain clinical materials in we currently receive no research funding for our programs under past or current collaborations as research funding concluded under our hedgehog agonist collaboration with wyeth in february we expect that our future research and development revenues under our current collaborations with genentech and debiopharm will be limited to expenses that we incur on their behalf for which each is obligated to reimburse us

the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily the result of a  decrease in spending related to cudc when compared to the same prior year period 
we incurred significant consulting and outside costs during the year ended december  as we prepared and filed the investigational new drug application for cudc with the fda 
costs incurred during the year ended december  were primarily comprised of costs associated with our ongoing phase i trial 
in addition  spending related to cudc decreased by  as a result of the license agreement entered into with debiopharm in august debiopharm has assumed all future costs related to this program as of the august effective date of our agreement 
the decrease in research and development expenses is also due to our implementation of a plan to decrease spending in various research and development expense areas  particularly preclinical research in areas other than in our targeted cancer programs 
spending reductions included decreases in contract medicinal chemistry and biology work that was being performed in china  and in personnel and occupancy costs 
in addition  our hedgehog agonist program under collaboration with wyeth concluded in february as a result of these decreases we decreased spending in our hedgehog agonist and discovery research programs by  to  during the year ended december  as compared to spending of  on these programs during offsetting these decreases was an increase of  in spending relating to our other targeted cancer programs from the prior year as we continue to conduct research in our ongoing efforts to select additional preclinical candidates for future development 
we expect that a majority of our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future will be incurred in support of our efforts to advance cudc and our other targeted cancer programs 
during the year ended december   we also incurred expenses of  related to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program as compared to  during the same period in the prior year  an increase of  we made  in payments to our university licensors in each of the years ending december  and relating to the contingent payments we received from genentech for the achievement of a clinical development objective during the respective periods 
we expect that future payment obligations related to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program will continue to fluctuate in relation to future payments under this collaboration

this increase was primarily due to increased spending for consulting and legal services 
fees for legal services increased  during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to costs associated with various matters  including  in preparation for an arbitration proceeding that we filed against a former collaborator in august in  we incurred approximately  in expenses related to this matter that will be net against the settlement proceeds of  that we received in february consulting services increased  primarily as the result of business development efforts used to facilitate the licensing agreement with debiopharm 
offsetting these increases  personnel costs decreased  due to pay decreases for executive officers implemented in the fourth quarter of in addition  other general and administrative costs decreased by  as a result of lower travel costs and stock based compensation  which decreased by  as a result of a decline in the grant date fair values of stock options awarded in compared to other income for the year ended december   interest income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or

research and development revenues decreased by  because all research funding for programs under collaboration concluded at various times beginning in march in addition  our license revenues decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to the recognition of  in revenue under our june hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech during resulting from changed facts and circumstances related to our joint steering committee performance obligations 
this amount had been previously deferred indefinitely 
in addition  we recorded  in license fee revenues received from genentech as a contingent cash payment during the year ended december   and we recorded  in license fee revenues received from genentech related to contingent cash payments received during the year ended december  license revenues recognized under our collaborations with procter gamble and wyeth decreased  and  respectively  as a result of the conclusion of these collaborations

this decrease was due to decreased spending on programs under collaborations offset by increased spending on our targeted programs  specifically cudc  which was selected as a development candidate in july spending on our collaborator funded programs with i genentech for the wnt signaling pathway  ii wyeth for the hedgehog agonist  and iii centocor for bmp small molecule agonists decreased by an aggregate amount of  as a result of the conclusion of the research funding for each of these programs at various times between march and february certain of these resources were reallocated across our internal targeted cancer programs 
our lead targeted drug development candidate  cudc  which was selected for clinical development in march and for which we initiated a phase i clinical trial in august  accounted for a decrease in spending of  offsetting these decreases  spending on our second development candidate  cudc  accounted for an increase in spending of  during the year ended december   we also incurred expenses of  an increase of  over the same prior year period  related to  in payments that we were required to make to our university licensors under our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program as a result of the  in contingent payments received from genentech for the achievement of clinical development objectives during during  we incurred payments to these university licensors of  related to this program

stock based compensation decreased  for the year ended december  as a result of the grant of stock options for a smaller number of shares  and related expense  awarded during compared to the prior year period 
in addition  legal services decreased  primarily due to costs associated with foreign patent applications in the prior year period  and employee costs decreased  for the year ended december   employee costs related to bonuses and k matching contribution costs were  we did not incur such costs during due to spending reductions taken in an effort to conserve cash 
in furtherance of these efforts  our executive officers reduced their respective salaries in october in exchange for stock options and restricted stock

at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  excluding restricted investments of  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations 
we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
while as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  material losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or marketable securities since december   no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or marketable securities or our ability to

further dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and or liquidity of marketable securities owned by us 
on january   we entered into a placement agent agreement with rbc capital markets corporation and rodman renshaw  llc relating to our registered direct offering  issuance and sale to a select group of investors of  units with each unit consisting of i one share of our common stock  par value per share and ii one warrant to purchase of a share of common stock at a price of per unit 
we received net proceeds from the sale of the units  after deducting offering expenses  of approximately  cash flows the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office and laboratory  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  laboratory supplies  consulting fees and legal fees 
during  we began incurring clinical costs associated with our phase i clinical trial of cudc we expect that costs associated with clinical studies will increase in future periods assuming that cudc advances into further stages of clinical testing and other of our targeted cancer drug candidates reach clinical trials 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash during the year ended december   including a decrease of  in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities  an increase of  in our accounts receivables and an increase of  in prepaid expenses and other current assets

offsetting these decreases were noncash items stock based compensation expense of  and depreciation of we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we continue to seek to advance our targeted cancer drug programs through preclinical testing and clinical development 
in addition  in the future we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensors based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and other specified objectives 
investing activities provided cash of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities resulted principally from  and  in net investment sales to fund ongoing operations for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents funding requirements we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we will require substantial funds to continue our research and development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals 
in particular  our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for working capital to support our research and development activities for cudc and other small molecules that we are seeking to develop from our pipeline of targeted cancer programs  and to fund our general and administrative costs and expenses 
we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the research funding portion of our collaboration agreements 
however  we have no current source of research funding revenue 
we expect that our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments and research and development funding that we may receive if we are able to successfully enter into new collaboration agreements  contingent cash payments that we may receive for the achievement of development objectives under any new collaborations or our existing collaborations with genentech and debiopharm  and royalty payments that are contingent upon the successful commercialization of products based upon these collaborations 
we may not be able to successfully enter into or continue any corporate collaborations and the timing  amount and likelihood of us receiving payments under such collaborations is highly uncertain 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will attain any further revenue under any collaborations or licensing arrangements 
we anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and working capital at december   together with the  in net proceeds from the registered direct offering we received in january and the  we expect to receive from debiopharm in march  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the first half of we currently have no planned material capital expenditures for our current facility lease expires december and we may choose to move to another facility in such a move may require that we make certain material capital expenditures for equipment and leasehold improvements to ensure that the facility meets our operating requirements 
our future capital requirements  however  may vary from what we currently expect 
there are a number of factors that may adversely affect our planned future capital requirements and accelerate our need for additional financing  many of which are outside our control  including the following unanticipated costs in our research and development programs  the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  the timing  receipt and amount of payments  if any  from current and potential future collaborators  the timing and amount of payments due to licensors of patent rights and technology used in our drug candidates  unplanned costs to prepare  file  prosecute  maintain and enforce patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and technology license fees  and unexpected losses in our cash investments or an inability to otherwise liquidate our cash investments due to unfavorable conditions in the capital markets 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings of debt or equity 
the market for emerging life science stocks in general  and the market for our common stock in particular  are highly volatile 
due to this and various other factors  including currently adverse general market conditions and the early stage status of our development pipeline  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may be dilutive or otherwise adversely affect other rights of our stockholders 
we also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators  licensees or other third parties 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our 
table of contents technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  whether through sales of debt or equity or through third party collaboration or license arrangements  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs  including some or all of our drug candidates 
contractual obligations as of december   we had future payments required under contractual obligations and other commitments  including an operating lease related to our facility  research services agreements  consulting agreements  and license agreements  as follows payment due by period amounts in s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations outside service obligations consist of agreements we have with outside labs  consultants and various other service organizations 
in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensees based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
these potential future obligations are not included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of fasb codification subtopic previously included within eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf 
the consensus to eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
eitf previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
under eitf  if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we will have to evaluate the impact of this standard on future revenue arrangements that we may enter into 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our current cash balances in excess of operating requirements are invested in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
this objective may be adversely affected by the recent economic downturn and volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
while as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  material losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or marketable securities since december   no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or marketable securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 
further dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and or liquidity of marketable securities owned by us 
our investments are investment grade securities  and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we currently have the ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to recover the fair value of the investment and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the fair value of the investment is recoverable 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a change in interest rate percentages would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income
