item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and securities  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings 
other significant sources of pre tax income are service charges on deposit accounts and other loan fees 
we also recognize income or losses from the sale of investments in years that we have such sales 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
charge offs  if any  are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and value of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations  and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
expenses 
the noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses  occupancy and equipment expenses  advertising and public relations expenses  regulatory fees and deposit insurance premiums and various other miscellaneous expenses 
salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes and expenses for health insurance and other employee benefits  and stock based compensation 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment  consist primarily of depreciation charges  furniture and equipment expenses  maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and costs of utilities 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to years 
advertising and public relations expenses include expenses for print  radio and television advertisements  promotions  third party marketing services and premium items 
regulatory fees and deposit insurance premiums are primarily payments we make to the fdic for insurance of our deposit accounts 
other expenses include expenses for supplies  telephone and postage  data processing  expenses related to other real estate owned by the bank  director and committee fees  professional fees  insurance and surety bond premiums and other fees and expenses 
noninterest expenses have also increased as a result of our strategy to expand our branch network 
these additional expenses consist of salaries and employee benefits and occupancy and equipment expenses 
over time  we anticipate that we will generate sufficient income to offset the expenses related to our new facilities and new employees  but we cannot assure you that our branch expansion will increase our earnings or that it will increase our earnings within a reasonable period of time 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance on a quarterly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the ots  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
such agency may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
for additional discussion  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed in accounting standards codification asc under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period  which would negatively affect earnings 
the company adopted the provisions of asc to account for uncertainty in income taxes effective july  implementation resulted in no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption 
the company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of june  and the company recognized no interest and penalties on the underpayment of income taxes during fiscal years june  and  and had no accrued interest and penalties on the balance sheet as of june  and the company has no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase with the next twelve months 
the company is no longer subject to us federal  state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before operating strategy our mission is to operate and grow a profitable  independent community oriented financial institution serving primarily retail customers and small businesses in our market areas 
we plan to continue our strategy of increasing core deposits through the expansion of our branch network and new deposit products  expanding our branch network and upgrading our existing branches  pursuing opportunities to increase and diversify our loan portfolio in our expanding market areas  applying disciplined underwriting practices to maintain a high quality loan portfolio  and continuing to increase our sale of non deposit investment products and services 
increasing core deposits through the expansion of our branch network and new deposit products historically  retail deposits are our primary source of funds for investing and lending 
however  in recent years  we have increased our reliance on municipal deposits significantly 
these municipal deposits represent tax and other revenues from the local gaming industry 
currently  our core deposits include all deposit account types except certificates of deposit and municipal deposits 
core deposits are generally lower in cost to us than certificate of deposit accounts  and they are generally less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate 
at june   core deposits represented of our total deposits 
expanding our branch network and upgrading our existing branches on june   united community bank completed the purchase of three branches from integra bank national association 
the purchase of the three branches has expanded the bank s footprint to include ripley county  indiana 
the new branches continue to be funded by cash generated by our business 
consequently  we did not need to borrow funds for these expansion projects 
we may continue to upgrade our current branch facilities and may pursue further expansion in southeastern indiana  northern kentucky or southwest ohio in future years through de novo branching  branch acquisitions and acquisitions of other financial institutions 
pursuing opportunities to increase and diversify our lending portfolio in our expanding market areas in recent years we have sought to diversify our loan portfolio beyond residential mortgage loans 
at june  our multi family and nonresidential real estate  land  consumer  commercial business  and construction loan portfolio was of our total loan portfolio 
during this period  we have taken advantage of the significant growth in both residential and nonresidential real estate development in our market and have originated loans in other market areas 
we expect to continue to expand all of our lending activities 
we expect that our loan portfolio  including our multi family and nonresidential real estate  commercial business and construction loan portfolio  will continue to increase 
applying disciplined underwriting practices to maintain the high quality of our loan portfolio we believe that high asset quality is a key to long term financial success 
we have sought to grow and diversify the loan portfolio  while maintaining a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk  using underwriting standards that we believe are conservative and diligent monitoring and collection efforts 
the recession in the local and national economy during the year ended june  has had a negative impact on the ability of some of our borrowers to repay their loans 
our nonperforming loans totaled million or of our total loans at june   compared to million or at june   and or at june  management does not believe that the recent increase in nonperforming loans is indicative of our current lending policies 
management is continuing to work with these borrowers to minimize the risk of loss to the bank  and has continued to implement more stringent lending standards in an effort to reduce nonperforming loans in the future 
continuing to increase noninterest income our profits rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings 
in order to decrease our reliance on interest rate spread income  we have pursued initiatives to increase noninterest income 
our primary recurring source of noninterest income has been services charges on deposit products and other services 
recent regulatory changes have restricted our ability to charge for other services 
we are continuing to review programs to enhance our service fee structure within the new regulatory environment 
balance sheet analysis loans 
our primary lending activity is the origination of loans secured by real estate 
we originate one to four family residential loans  multi family and nonresidential real estate loans and construction loans 
to a lesser extent  we originate commercial and consumer loans 
from time to time  as part of our loss mitigation process  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when we determine that greater economic value will ultimately be recovered under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
we may consider the borrower s payment status and history  the borrower s ability to pay upon a rate reset on an adjustable rate mortgage  size of the payment increase upon a rate reset  period of time remaining prior to the rate reset  and other relevant factors in determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty 
we do not offer  and have not previously offered  subprime  alt a  low doc  no doc loans or loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest only loans 
the largest segment of our loan portfolio is one to four family residential loans 
at june   these loans totaled million  or of total gross loans  compared to million  or of total loans  at june  as a percentage of the total loan portfolio  one to four family residential loans have decreased over the last two years  due to customers refinancing into lower fixed rate loans that are being sold to freddie mac 
multi family and nonresidential real estate and land loans totaled million and represented of total loans at june   compared to million  or of total loans  at june  our multi family and nonresidential real estate loan portfolio growth as a percentage of the overall portfolio in recent years is the result of one to four family loans being refinanced into lower fixed rates and sold to freddie mac 
construction loans totaled million  or of total loans  at june   compared to million  or of total loans  at june  the increase in construction loans is the result of having seven loans outstanding at june  compared to only five at june  commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans  at june   compared to million  or of total loans  at june  and million  or of total loans  at june  consumer loans totaled million  or of total loans  at june   compared to million  or of total loans  at june  the increase in the consumer loan portfolio for the year ended june  is attributable to the previously mentioned acquisition of three branches from integra bank

the increase in other income is attributable to the settlement of a claim in the current year 
the decrease in sale of loans is due to rates remaining relatively flat in the current year  while they decreased significantly in the prior year causing a significant increase of refinancing into longer term fixed rate loans that were sold to freddie mac

the acquisition related expenses in the current year relate to the expenses incurred with the acquisition of three branches from integra 
the increase in deposit insurance premiums is a result of increased deposit balances during the year  along with increased assessment rates due to the impact of the current economic environment on the deposit insurance fund 
the increase in employee compensation is the result of adding staff as our customer base has grown over the last year including the branch acquisition at the end of the year 
the decrease in provision for loss on the sale of other real estate owned is a result of the bank holding less real estate owned reo for sale in the current year than in the prior year

income tax expense increased  to a provision of  for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  the increase in expense was primarily due to an increase of  in income before taxes 
the effective tax rate for was compared to in the increase in the effective rate was attributable to tax exempt municipal bond income being a smaller portion of income before taxes in the current year 
risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities  that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
this strategy also emphasizes the origination of one to four family mortgage loans  which typically have lower default rates than other types of loans and are secured by collateral that generally tends to appreciate in value 
when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  we take a number of steps to attempt to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
when the loan becomes days past due  a late charge notice is generated and sent to the borrower and phone calls are made 
if payment is not then received by the th day of delinquency  a further notification is sent to the borrower 
if no successful workout can be achieved  after a loan becomes days delinquent  we may commence foreclosure or other legal proceedings 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure 
we may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances 
management reports to the board of directors monthly regarding the amount of loans delinquent more than days  all loans in foreclosure  all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider repossessed assets and loans that are days or more past due to be nonperforming assets 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become days delinquent at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed assets until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is initially recorded at the lower of its cost  or market  less estimate selling expenses 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
the following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated

no interest related to nonaccrual loans was included in interest income for the year ended june  federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the ots has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as special mention or substandard  we account for those classifications when establishing a general allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as doubtful or loss  we establish a specific allowance for the asset at that time 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated 
at june  dollars in thousands special mention assets substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets other than disclosed in the above tables  there are no other loans at june  that management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the increase in classified assets is due to the continued economic recession 
management believes there are adequate allowances and collateral securing these loans to cover losses that may result from these nonperforming loans 
all of the loans were more than days delinquent at june  troubled debt restructurings 
at june   the bank had thirteen loans categorized as troubled debt restructurings  totaling million 
at june   the bank had five loans categorized as troubled debt restructurings  totaling million 
at june  and  the bank had one loan for million that was categorized as both a nonperforming loan and a troubled debt restructuring 
there are no other commitments to lend additional amounts to these borrowers 
management has reduced the carrying value of all troubled debt restructurings to their fair market values  based upon differences between their agreed upon rates of interest and available market rates at the time of the loan 
delinquencies 
the following table provides information about delinquencies in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
at june  days past due days past due days past due days past due days past due days past due dollars in thousands residential real estate one to four family multi family nonresidential real estate and land consumer and other loans total analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
the recommendations for increases or decreases to the allowance are presented by management to the board of directors 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allowance on identified problem loans  and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
specific allowance required for identified problem loans 
we establish an allowance on certain identified problem loans based on such factors as the strength of the customer s personal or business cash flows  the availability of other sources of repayment  the amount due or past due  the type and value of collateral  the strength of our collateral position  the estimated cost to sell the collateral  and the borrower s effort to cure the delinquency 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
we establish a general allowance for loans that are not delinquent to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning percentages to each category 
the percentages are adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas and the national economy  staff lending experience  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  specific reserve and classified asset trends  delinquency trends and risk rating trends 
these loss factors are subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
as a result of our systematic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the loss factors we presently use to determine the reserve level were updated in based on various risk factors such as trends in underperforming loans  trends and concentrations in loans and loan volume  economic trends in our market area  particularly the impact of the gaming and tourism industry on the economy of our market area  the effect of which has become significant in recent periods 
in order to reflect trends in the composition of our loan portfolio and in our recent historical loan loss experience  we increased the allowance percentage on certain loan categories which demonstrated a higher risk of loss and decreased the allowance percentage on certain loan categories which demonstrated a lower risk of loss 
the update to the allowance percentages resulted in a decrease in the amount of the allowance allocated to loans secured by one to four family residential properties and an increase in the amount of the allowance allocated to loans secured by multi family real estate  nonresidential real estate and loans  commercial business loans and consumer loans 
we also identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans  classified loans and other loans that management may have concerns about collectability 
for individually reviewed loans  the borrower s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan or a shortfall in collateral value would result in our allocating a portion of the allowance to the loan that was impaired 
at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased to million at june  from million at june  the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated

furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that the ots  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
the ots may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes adjusting the maturities of borrowings  adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration  and generally selling in the secondary market newly originated conforming fixed rate  and year one to four family residential real estate loans and available for sale securities 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have an asset liability committee  which includes members of management and board members  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income 
net portfolio value analysis 
we use a net portfolio value analysis prepared by the ots to review our level of interest rate risk 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
these analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or and basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
because of the low level of market interest rates  these analyses are not performed for decreases of more than basis points 
the following table  which is based on information that we provide to the ots  presents the change in our net portfolio value at june  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on ots assumptions  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change 
net portfolio value dollars in thousands net portfolio value as of portfolio value of assets basis point bp change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp the ots uses various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity 
liquidity management 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demands  expected deposit flows  in particular municipal deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june  securities classified as available for sale whose market value exceeds our cost  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at june  total securities classified as available for sale were million at june  in addition  at june   we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately million from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
at june   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  consisting of million in mortgage loan commitments  million in commercial loan commitments  million in unused home equity lines of credit  million in commercial lines of credit  and  in letters of credit outstanding 
certificates of deposit due within one year of june  totaled million 
this represented of certificates of deposit at june  we believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before june  we believe  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
the following table presents certain of our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than years dollars in thousands at june  long term debt obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities 
our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit relationships 
occasionally  we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits

united community bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the ots  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at june   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see regulation and supervision regulation of federal savings associations capital requirements  and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  letters of credit and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently have no plans to engage in hedging activities in the future 
for the year ended june   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
