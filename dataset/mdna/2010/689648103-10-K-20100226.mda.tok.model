item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on july   otter tail corporation completed a holding company reorganization whereby otter tail power company otp  which had previously been operated as a division of otter tail corporation  became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent holding company named otter tail corporation formerly known as otter tail holding company 
the new parent holding company now known as otter tail corporation was incorporated in june under the laws of the state of minnesota in connection with the holding company reorganization 
references in this report to otter tail corporation and the company refer  for periods prior to july   to the corporation that was the registrant prior to the reorganization  and  for periods after the reorganization  to the new parent holding company  in each case including its consolidated subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires 
otter tail corporation and its subsidiaries form a diverse group of businesses with operations classified into six segments electric  plastics  manufacturing  health services  food ingredient processing and other business operations 
our primary financial goals are to maximize earnings and cash flows and to allocate capital profitably toward growth opportunities that will increase shareholder value 
meeting these objectives enables us to preserve and enhance our financial capability by maintaining desired capitalization ratios and a strong interest coverage position and preserving solid credit ratings on outstanding securities  which  in the form of lower interest rates  benefits both our customers and shareholders 
our strategy is to continue to develop a core regulated electric utility combined with a diversified multi industry platform 
reliable utility performance combined with growth opportunities at all our businesses provides long term value 
growing our core electric utility business provides a strong base of revenues  earnings and cash flows 
we look to our nonelectric operating companies to provide organic growth as well 
organic  internal growth comes from new products and services  market expansion and increased efficiencies 
we expect much of our growth in the next few years will come from utilizing expanded plant capacity from capital investments made in and we may also grow through acquisitions 
we adhere to strict guidelines when reviewing acquisition candidates 
our aim is to add companies that will produce an immediate positive impact on earnings and provide long term growth potential 
we believe that owning well run  profitable companies across different industries will bring more growth opportunities and more balance to our results 
in doing this  we also avoid concentrating business risk within a single industry 
all of our operating companies operate under a decentralized business model with disciplined corporate oversight 
we assess the performance of our operating companies over time  using the following criteria ability to provide returns on invested capital that exceed our weighted average cost of capital over the long term  and assessment of an operating company s business and potential for future earnings growth 
we are a committed long term owner and therefore we do not acquire companies in pursuit of short term gains 
however  we may divest operating companies that no longer fit into our strategy over the long term 
following  are highlights of our operations we achieved record annual net cash from operations of million 
our food ingredient processing segment reported record net income of million 
net income from our electric segment increased to million 
otp invested million in its third rate base wind farm 
this is a mw project which is a portion of the luverne wind farm in steele county  north dakota 
otp received grant proceeds of million under the american recovery and reinvestment act of related to its million investment in wind turbines at the luverne wind farm 
otp announced its withdrawal from participation in the planned construction of a to megawatt generating unit at its big stone plant site

increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates are important components of costs for companies in these segments 
any or all of these components could be impacted by inflation or other pricing pressures  with a possible adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
in recent years  our operating companies have faced 
table of contents strong inflationary and other pricing pressures with respect to steel  fuel  resin  lumber  concrete  aluminum and health care costs  which have been partially mitigated by pricing adjustments 
liquidity the following table presents the status of our lines of credit as of december  and december  in use on restricted due to available on available on december  outstanding december  december  in thousands line limit letters of credit otter tail corporation credit agreement otp credit agreement total on january   otp paid off the remaining million balance outstanding on its two year  million term loan that was originally due on may   using lower costs funds available under the otp credit agreement 
otp did not incur any penalties for the early repayment and retirement of this debt 
we believe we have the necessary liquidity to effectively conduct business operations for an extended period if current market conditions continue 
despite the recent economic recession  our balance sheet is strong and we are in compliance with our debt covenants 
we believe our financial condition is strong and that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  existing lines of credit  access to capital markets and borrowing ability because of solid credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
on may  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which we may offer for sale  from time to time  either separately or together in any combination  equity  debt or other securities described in the shelf registration statement 
equity or debt financing will be required in the period through given the expansion plans related to our electric segment to fund construction of new rate base investments  in the event we decide to reduce borrowings under our lines of credit  to refund or retire early any of our presently outstanding debt or cumulative preferred shares  to complete acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
also  our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside our control 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by changing interest rates on short term and long term debt and ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies  which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
our dividend payout ratio for the year ended december  was compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends to be declared and paid will depend on  among other things  our financial condition  cash flows from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects

table of contents business outlook we anticipate diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to

our current consolidated capital expenditures expectation for is in the range of million 
this compares with million of capital expenditures in we continue to explore investments in generation and transmission projects for the electric segment that could have positive impacts on our earnings and returns on capital 
contributing to our earnings guidance for are the following items we expect lower levels of net income from our electric segment in this decrease is due to continued soft wholesale power markets  lower afudc earnings as there are no large construction projects expected in  and increased operating and maintenance expense in due primarily to increased employee benefit costs 
expectations in also reflect an interim rate increase of approximately million in the minnesota jurisdiction 
we expect our plastics segment s performance to improve and be more in line with results 
we expect earnings from our manufacturing segment to improve in as a result of the following improved earnings are expected at btd in due to productivity improvements and cost reductions made in results at shoremaster are expected to be near breakeven in given the restructuring of costs that occurred in shoremaster continues to be affected by current depressed economic conditions and does not expect any improvement to overall business conditions until the economy starts to recover

table of contents critical accounting policies involving significant estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to consolidated financial statements 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives  asset impairment evaluations  tax provisions  collectability of trade accounts receivable  self insurance programs  unbilled electric revenues  accrued renewable resource and transmission rider revenues  valuations of forward energy contracts  service contract maintenance costs  percentage of completion and actuarially determined benefits costs and liabilities 
as better information becomes available or actual amounts are known  estimates are revised 
operating results can be affected by revised estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations and costs pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and expenses for our electric utility and corporate employees are determined by actuaries using assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and healthcare cost trend rates 
further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions is included in note to consolidated financial statements 
these benefits  for any individual employee  can be earned and related expenses can be recognized and a liability accrued over periods of up to or more years 
these benefits can be paid out for up to or more years after an employee retires 
estimates of liabilities and expenses related to these benefits are among our most critical accounting estimates 
although deferral and amortization of fluctuations in actuarially determined benefit obligations and expenses are provided for when actual results on a year to year basis deviate from long range assumptions  compensation increases and healthcare cost increases or a reduction in the discount rate applied from one year to the next can significantly increase our benefit expenses in the year of the change 
also  a reduction in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets in our funded pension plan or realized rates of return on plan assets that are well below assumed rates of return could result in significant increases in recognized pension benefit expenses in the year of the change or for many years thereafter because actuarial losses can be amortized over the average remaining service lives of active employees 
the pension benefit cost for for our noncontributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals will be in compared with used in in selecting the discount rate  we consider the yields of fixed income debt securities  which have ratings of aa published by recognized rating agencies  along with bond matching models specific to our plans as a basis to determine the rate 
subsequent increases or decreases in actual rates of return on plan assets over assumed rates or increases or decreases in the discount rate or rate of increase in future compensation levels could significantly change projected costs 
for  all other factors being held constant a increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pension benefit cost by  a decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pension benefit cost by  a increase in the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels would have increased our pension benefit cost by  a decrease in the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels would have decreased our pension benefit cost by  a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased our pension benefit cost by  increases or decreases in the discount rate or in retiree healthcare cost inflation rates could significantly change our projected postretirement healthcare benefit costs 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased our postretirement medical benefit costs by  see note to consolidated financial statements for the cost impact of a change in medical cost inflation rates 
we believe the estimates made for our pension and other postretirement benefits are reasonable based on the information that is known at the point in time the estimates are made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of variables and are subject to change 

table of contents revenue recognition our construction companies and two of our manufacturing companies record operating revenues on a percentage of completion basis for fixed price construction contracts 
the method used to determine the progress of completion is based on the ratio of labor costs incurred to total estimated labor costs at our wind tower manufacturer  square footage completed to total bid square footage for certain floating dock projects and costs incurred to total estimated costs on all other construction projects 
the duration of the majority of these contracts is less than a year 
revenues recognized on jobs in progress as of december  were million 
any expected losses on jobs in progress at year end have been recognized 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the percentage of completion accounting on uncompleted contracts is critical to the extent that any underestimate of total expected costs on fixed price construction contracts could result in reduced profit margins being recognized on these contracts at the time of completion 
forward energy contracts classified as derivatives otp s forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity are derivatives subject to mark to market accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
the market prices used to value otp s forward contracts for the purchases and sales of electricity and electricity generating capacity are determined by survey of counterparties or brokers used by otp s power services personnel responsible for contract pricing  as well as prices gathered from daily settlement prices published by the intercontinental exchange 
for certain contracts  prices at illiquid trading points are based on a basis spread between that trading point and more liquid trading hub prices 
these basis spreads are determined based on available market price information and the use of forward price curve models and  as such  are estimates 
the forward energy sales contracts that are marked to market as of december   are offset by forward energy purchase contracts in terms of volumes  delivery periods and delivery points 
otp s recognized but unrealized net gains on the forward energy purchases and sales marked to market on december  are expected to be realized on settlement as scheduled over the following years in the amounts listed in thousands total net gain allowance for doubtful accounts our operating companies encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  they record provisions for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the operating companies primarily utilize historical rates of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate  such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  operating companies compare identified credit risks with allowances that have been established using historical experience and adjust allowances accordingly 
in circumstances where an operating company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet financial obligations  the operating company records a specific allowance for bad debts to reduce the account receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
we believe the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is critical because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
during  million of bad debt expense of total revenue of billion was recorded and the allowance for doubtful accounts was million of trade accounts receivable as of december  general economic conditions and specific geographic concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense 
an increase or decrease in our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts based on one percentage point of outstanding trade receivables at december  would result in a million increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
although an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts on our operating companies accounts receivable is provided for  the allowance for doubtful accounts on the electric segment s wholesale electric sales is insignificant in proportion to annual revenues from these sales 
the electric segment has not experienced a bad debt related to wholesale electric sales largely due to stringent risk management criteria related to these sales 
nonpayment on a single wholesale electric sale could result in a significant bad debt expense 

table of contents depreciation expense and depreciable lives the provisions for depreciation of electric utility property for financial reporting purposes are made on the straight line method based on the estimated service lives to years of the properties 
such provisions as a percent of the average balance of depreciable electric utility property were in  in and in depreciation rates on electric utility property are subject to annual regulatory review and approval  and depreciation expense is recovered through rates set by ratemaking authorities 
although the useful lives of electric utility properties are estimated  the recovery of their cost is dependent on the ratemaking process 
deregulation of the electric industry could result in changes to the estimated useful lives of electric utility property that could impact depreciation expense 
property and equipment of our nonelectric operations are carried at historical cost or at the then current replacement cost if acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are depreciated on a straight line basis over useful lives to years of the related assets 
we believe the lives and methods of determining depreciation are reasonable  however  changes in economic conditions affecting the industries in which our nonelectric companies operate or innovations in technology could result in a reduction of the estimated useful lives of our nonelectric operating companies property  plant and equipment or in an impairment write down of the carrying value of these properties 
taxation we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities 
these tax obligations include income  real estate and use taxes 
these judgments could result in the recognition of a liability for potential adverse outcomes regarding uncertain tax positions that we have taken 
while we believe our liability for uncertain tax positions as of december  reflects the most likely probable expected outcome of these tax matters in accordance with the requirements of asc  income taxes  the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in additional adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
however  we do not believe such adjustments would be material 
deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
we assess our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance related to the probability of recovery of our deferred tax assets as we believe reductions in tax payments related to these assets will be fully realized in the future 
asset impairment we are required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may exceed its fair value and not be recoverable 
we apply the accounting guidance under accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment subsequent measurement  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard requires that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from a company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset 
we believe the accounting estimates related to an asset impairment are critical because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period reflecting changing business cycles and require management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
as of december  an assessment of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets and other intangibles indicated these assets were not impaired 
goodwill impairment goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to asc  goodwill subsequent measurement 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying amount  an impairment adjustment must be recorded 

table of contents we believe accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment are critical because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  asc requires goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
as of december  we have million of goodwill and million in nonamortizable trade names recorded on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of shoremaster and its subsidiary companies 
shoremaster produces and markets residential and commercial waterfront equipment  ranging from boatlifts and docks for lakefront property to full commercial marina projects 
the business has experienced reduced demand for its products due to the recent economic recession and has incurred net losses 
we considered these adverse developments in the business to be an indicator of potential impairment of shoremaster s goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on the current goodwill review  we concluded that no impairment charge was necessary 
however  if current economic conditions continue to impact the amount of sales of waterfront products and shoremaster is not successful with reorganizing and streamlining its business to improve operating margins according to our projections  the reductions in anticipated cash flows from this business may indicate  in a future period  that its fair value is less than its carrying amount resulting in an impairment of some or all of the goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets associated with shoremaster along with a corresponding charge against earnings 
shoremaster s current operating plan calls for modest revenue growth in in line with growth in gross domestic product 
with the cost reduction efforts that have occurred over the past year  we expect shoremaster s earnings to be near breakeven in given the nature of shoremaster s products and the markets it serves  our operating plans assume revenue and earnings growth will begin to occur in these revenue growth assumptions are consistent with shoremaster s historical growth rates before the recent economic downturn 
inherent in these assumptions is that shoremaster s manufacturing capacity utilization will increase from current utilization of to approximately of capacity for the year ending shoremaster is expecting its dealer base to grow during this period of time which is reasonable given its historic ability to grow its dealer base 
shoremaster has not experienced any deterioration in its dealer base during the economic downturn 
the weighted average cost of capital used for this analysis was which is reflective of the risks inherent in shoremaster s industry 
this compares with the previous weighted average cost of capital of which was used in the previous year annual goodwill review for shoremaster 
we used a terminal value growth rate of in this discounted cash flow analysis 
the current operating plan with its assumptions shows the following in thousands enterprise value interest bearing debt market value of common equity book value of common equity excess of market value over book value the following changes in our assumptions would have the following impact on these estimated values impact on fair value assumption change in thousands annual revenue growth rate plus  annual revenue growth rate minus  annual gross margin plus  annual gross margin minus  discount rate plus 
 discount rate minus 
 should the assumptions used in these current operating plans not materialize and the market value of shoremaster s common equity be significantly below its book value  an impairment charge of up to million could be recorded 

table of contents we currently have million of goodwill and million in nonamortizable trade names recorded on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of btd and its subsidiary companies 
btd provides stamped metal parts and fabricated metal products to a number of equipment and product manufacturers and assemblers throughout the united states 
we expect btd to return to revenue and earnings levels by if current economic conditions continue to impact sales of manufactured metal products and btd is not able to achieve sales and earnings consistent with levels as projected  the reductions in anticipated cash flows from this business may indicate  in a future period  that its fair value is less than its carrying value resulting in an impairment of some or all of the goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets associated with btd along with a corresponding charge against earnings 
an impairment charge consisting of the goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets of both shoremaster and btd combined would not have a significant impact on our financial position and would not put us in violation of our debt covenants 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and as conditions warrant 
as of december  an assessment of the carrying amounts of our goodwill indicated no impairment and the fair values of our remaining reporting units are substantially in excess of their respective book values 
acquisition method of accounting through december   under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  business combinations  we have accounted for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on third party estimates and valuations when available 
the remaining values are based on management s judgments and estimates  and  accordingly  our consolidated financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 
we account for acquisitions under the requirements of asc  business combinations 
under asc the term purchase method of accounting is replaced with acquisition method of accounting and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
this guidance replaces sfas no 
s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
acquired assets and liabilities assumed that are subject to critical estimates include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment is based on valuations performed by qualified internal personnel and or outside appraisers 
fair values assigned to plant and equipment are based on several factors including the age and condition of the equipment  maintenance records of the equipment and auction values for equipment with similar characteristics at the time of purchase 
intangible assets are identified and valued using the guidelines of asc the fair value of intangible assets is based on estimates including royalty rates  customer attrition rates and estimated cash flows 
while the allocation of purchase price is subject to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty  we do not expect the estimates to vary significantly once an acquisition is complete 
we believe our estimates have been reasonable in the past as there have been no significant valuation adjustments to the final allocation of purchase price 
key accounting pronouncements business combinations in december  the fasb issued new guidance on business combinations that applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the new guidance  under asc  business combinations  applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity the acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses the acquiree 
in addition to replacing the term purchase method of accounting with acquisition method of accounting  asc requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
this guidance replaces previous guidance on the cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the new guidance results in not recognizing some assets and liabilities at the acquisition date  and it also results in measuring some assets and liabilities at amounts other than their fair 
table of contents values at the acquisition date 
for example  prior guidance required the acquirer to include the costs incurred to effect an acquisition acquisition related costs in the cost of the acquisition that is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
the new guidance requires those costs to be expensed as incurred 
in addition  under previous guidance  restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not obligated to incur were recognized as if they were a liability assumed at the acquisition date 
the new guidance requires the acquirer to recognize those costs separately from the business combination

the majority of our consolidated long term debt has fixed interest rates 
the interest rate on variable rate long term debt is reset on a periodic basis reflecting current market conditions 
we manage our interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities  through economic refunding of debt through optional refundings  limiting the amount of variable interest rate debt  and the utilization of short term borrowings to allow flexibility in the timing and placement of long term debt 
as of december  we had million of long term debt subject to variable interest rates 
however  million of this debt was otp s variable rate term loan due may  that was early retired on january   without penalty 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average one percentage point higher or lower than the average variable rate on december   annualized interest expense and pre tax earnings would change by approximately we have not used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings

the plastics companies are exposed to market risk related to changes in commodity prices for pvc resins  the raw material used to manufacture pvc pipe 
the pvc pipe industry is highly sensitive to commodity raw material pricing volatility 
historically  when resin prices are rising or stable  sales volume has been higher and when resin prices are falling  sales volumes has been lower 
operating income may decline when the supply of pvc pipe increases faster than demand 
due to the commodity nature of pvc resin and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  it is very difficult to predict gross margin percentages or to assume that historical trends will continue

otp has market  price and credit risk associated with forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
as of december  otp had recognized  on a pretax basis   in net unrealized gains on open forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and electricity generating capacity 
due to the nature of electricity and the physical aspects of the electricity transmission system  unanticipated events affecting the transmission grid can cause transmission constraints that result in unanticipated gains or losses in the process of settling transactions 
the market prices used to value otp s forward contracts for the purchases and sales of electricity and electricity generating capacity are determined by survey of counterparties or brokers used by otp s power services personnel responsible for contract pricing  as well as prices gathered from daily settlement prices published by the intercontinental exchange 
for certain contracts  prices at illiquid trading points are based on a basis spread between that trading point and more liquid trading hub prices 
these basis spreads are determined based on available market price information and the use of forward price curve models 
the forward energy sales contracts that are marked to market as of december   are offset by forward energy purchase contracts in terms of volumes  delivery periods and delivery points 
we have in place an energy risk management policy with a goal to manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  price risk and credit risk associated with wholesale power purchases and sales 
with the advent of the miso day market in april  we made several changes to our energy risk management policy to recognize new trading opportunities created by this new market

iph has market risk associated with the price of fuel oil and natural gas used in its potato dehydration process as iph may not be able to increase prices for its finished products to recover increases in fuel costs 
the canadian operations of iph records its sales and carries its receivables in us dollars but pays its expenses for goods and services consumed in canada in canadian dollars 
the payment of its bills in canada requires the periodic exchange of us currency for canadian currency 
in order to lock in acceptable exchange rates and hedge its exposure to future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  iph s canadian subsidiary entered into forward contracts for the exchange of us dollars into canadian dollars in for the months of january through october each monthly contract was for the exchange of  us dollars for the amount of canadian dollars stated in each contract
