advertising revenue television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
most advertising supported cable networks rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots with a commitment to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel and receives enhanced exposure for its brand and products in these programs 
an additional form of television advertising is direct response advertising  which is designed to elicit a specific and quantifiable response from the viewer 
unlike spot advertising  fees payable for this form of advertising are measured by viewer response to advertising  such as product purchases  rather than the viewer ratings which measures success in programming 
a majority of the hallmark channel advertising revenue is comprised of spot advertising 
the hallmark movie channel s revenue has been comprised to date primarily of direct response revenue 
please see current challenges ratings in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information on the hallmark movie channel s commencing to sell spot advertising based on nielsen ratings 
the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
in the united states  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
our rates for spot advertisements are generally calculated on the basis of an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed commitment by the advertiser 
we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels in connection with their advertising 
advertising rates also vary by time of year due to seasonal changes in television viewership 
revenue is recorded net of estimated delivery shortfalls often referred to as audience deficiency units 
audience deficiency units adus are units of inventory rights to utilize future advertising timeframes that are made available to advertisers as fulfillment for past advertisements in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed viewership ratings 
adus are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
historically  there has been no cash paid to an advertiser to settle adus  but in  the company provided an immaterial amount of cash for settlements 
the remainder of the revenue is recognized as the make good advertising time is delivered in satisfaction of adus 
revenue from direct response advertising depends largely upon actions of viewers 
our channel typically sells approximately of its advertising in the up front season  generally in june and july  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for adus and sell the remainder in the spot or scatter market and to advertisers that purchase up front inventory on a calendar year basis 
for information on the up front season  see advertising revenue in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

total day means the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends

channel operations the programming department has been responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the marketing and creative services departments to create the distinctive appearance of our channels 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channels begins with the acquisition of programming 
our staff or third parties review and summarize all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically created by the company s employees  but are occasionally outsourced to external vendors

the scheduling department creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with advertising sales  research and distributor sales and marketing personnel to continuously monitor the effectiveness of programming content and sequence 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be distributed to the subscribers of the channels

competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels compete for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
the hallmark channel competes with other general entertainment programming from tnt  usa network  a e  tv land  lifetime  oxygen  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable  satellite and telephone systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  basic analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining analog channel space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following programming 
we have established a track record of providing high quality family programming 
pay television channels branded with the well known hallmark name 
our channels are branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content 
our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers  which in turn affects ratings and advertising revenue 
experienced management 
members of our senior management team have experience promoting and operating channels 
they have held senior positions at such companies as abc  cbs sports  fox family  discovery channel  amc and usa networks 
competitive risks we believe that our primary competitive risks include the following one primary channel distributed domestically 
we operate only two channels 
many of our competitors have more than two channels and are also diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple channels 
until the hallmark movie channel is more widely distributed  it will not provide significant leverage in negotiations with distributors and advertisers 
entertainment programming 
our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
our competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising 
our ratings are a significant and generally positive factor 
nevertheless  our competitors include channels with more subscribers and higher ratings  which affect rates that we can charge for advertising 
research the research department at the company provides strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the channels to our potential advertisers and affiliates 
this department provides data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our channels research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our channels market share 
the research department has sophisticated research tools and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
our channels performance is tracked through an internal tracking study established in july  which is a monthly telephone survey conducted among a national probability sample of approximately  adults 
the research department also subscribes to a number of other services  which are useful in obtaining information about viewers of our channel

among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this form k 
crown media holdings will not update any forward looking statements contained in this form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
our channels have a history of net losses and we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  total stockholders deficit of approximately million  and goodwill of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve an operating profit or sustain a positive cash flow 
if we are not able to do so  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses  to continue to be profitable before interest expense and to continue to generate a positive cash flow  we will need to increase our advertising and subscriber revenue 
this will require  among other things  maintaining the distribution of our channels  attracting more and younger viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  and maintaining or increasing our subscriber and advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
in addition  in order to accomplish these goals  the management of crown media holdings continues to believe that it is necessary to maintain subscriber levels and enhance our programming  which may result in increased costs for programming 
over the last five years  these actions have contributed to net losses for crown media holdings 
to achieve positive net income  we would also need to decrease our interest expense by reducing our outstanding indebtedness 
we believe that our ability to continue operations depends upon completion of the recapitalization 
we are unable to meet our debt obligations due august   which are owed to affiliates of hallmark cards and are owed under the bank credit facility 
the recapitalization is intended to exchange the existing debt obligations to the hallmark affiliates for new debt  preferred stock and common stock 
hallmark cards and its affiliates own beneficially a sufficient number of shares of class a and class b stock to approve the recapitalization transactions 
nevertheless  consummation of the recapitalization transactions is not assured 
various conditions must be satisfied for a closing of the recapitalization  including that hallmark cards has not delivered a written notice to the company certifying that hallmark cards  in its sole discretion  shall have determined that the status of any pending or threatened litigation or a regulatory proceeding involving the company or its subsidiaries in connection with the recapitalization is unsatisfactory to hallmark cards 
a lawsuit challenging the original proposal for the recapitalization was filed in  and the plaintiff in that lawsuit has indicated a continuing objection to the recapitalization 
we do not know what steps will be taken in this existing lawsuit or whether any new lawsuits will be brought in regard to the recapitalization 
in any event  there can be no assurance that the recapitalization will be completed 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
at this time  prior to the recapitalization  to the extent interest is deferred and added to principal  the indebtedness increases 
as of december   our total debt was billion  and we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our bank credit facility to support our operations 
as a result of our present level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  we are required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we are  and will continue to be  limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  and offers to purchase the company or its assets at prices that may be attractive to stockholders may be limited 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and to reduce our total debt likely depends at this time on completing the recapitalization  in the future our ability to meet our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating performances and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
even if the recapitalization is completed  we will have substantial indebtedness although significantly reduced as well as dividends that are paid or accrued on the preferred stock that will be outstanding  and the factors listed above some to a lesser extent will continue to apply 
information concerning our liquidity may be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
we have significant interest expense  which may impact our future operations 
high levels of interest expense could have negative effects on our future operations 
interest expense  which includes amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on borrowings under our senior and demand notes and bank credit facility  was significant over the past year 
although interest expense was lower in the past twelve months than in the previous twelve months  we continue to have significant outstanding indebtedness and related interest expense 
the recapitalization would significantly reduce our outstanding indebtedness and interest expense  nevertheless  even with the recapitalization  there will be substantial indebtedness and related interest expense 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 
our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
although in the past twelve months we generated positive cash flow from operations  unanticipated significant expense or any developments that hamper our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  may result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
except for the recapitalization  we have no arrangements for any such additional external financings  whether debt or equity  and are not certain whether any new external financing would be available on acceptable terms 
any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing lenders 
the company is currently unable to meet its debt obligations to hallmark cards and its affiliates and under the bank credit facility which come due on and after august  a default on the obligations due on august   would also result in a default under the company s senior secured note 
the company anticipates that prior to august   it will be necessary to extend  refinance or restructure i the bank credit facility and ii the promissory notes payable to affiliates of hallmark cards 
to accomplish those changes  the company plans to complete the recapitalization 
the recapitalization contemplates that we will endeavor to have a revolving line of credit with jpmorgan chase or another third party in the amount of million with a maturity date of not less than days from closing the recapitalization 
there is no assurance that hallmark cards and its affiliates will extend dates for the deferral of payments on indebtedness owed by us or participate in any extension  refinancing or restructuring of the indebtedness 
we have substantial outstanding obligations owed to hallmark cards and its affiliates 
these obligations include promissory notes and amounts owed under a service agreement 
hallmark cards  its affiliates and we are parties to the waiver agreement  as amended  under which principal payments and certain interest payments on the promissory notes are deferred until august   subject to earlier termination as provided in that agreement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources bank credit facility and hallmark notes and item certain relationships and related transactions and director independence 
these obligations and the waiver agreement have been negotiated by us with hallmark cards and its affiliates 
hallmark cards and its affiliates have indicated that they do not intend to extend the waiver agreement beyond august  any decision by hallmark cards and its affiliates on these matters other than pursuant to the recapitalization is at their discretion 
most favored nations provisions may require modification of existing distribution agreements which could adversely affect subscriber revenue 
a number of our existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations or mfn clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event we enter into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the distributor holding the mfn right  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
these clauses cover matters such as subscriber fees  launch support  local advertising time and other financial and operating provisions 
in the past  after entering into new distribution agreements  we have been asked by some of the distributors holding mfn rights to modify their distribution agreements to incorporate financial terms similar to those in the new agreements 
any claims of this type in the future could result in lower overall subscriber revenue or increased cash outlays  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modifications  it could result in higher advertising revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
our competitors may have greater numbers of original productions  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability or maintaining a positive cash flow and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
in the second  third and fourth quarters of  except for the holiday period commencing with thanksgiving and ending on january   we experienced declines in viewer ratings across demographic categories  compared to the same periods of  resulting in decreases in advertising revenues and cash flows 
this decline has continued in the early part of a number of changes to our program schedule were implemented in the second and third quarters of  including the replacement of programs that had appeared in the schedule for a number of years  as well as a shift in scheduling strategy to more specifically target our prime demographic group of women these changes have caused a temporary disruption to established viewing patterns for our audience resulting in declines in household ratings but over time are intended to increase our delivery of viewers in the women demographic category 
we are considering further changes in our programming that may be helpful 
we must successfully implement the program rescheduling with an increase in ratings  which is uncertain  or otherwise address the decrease in ratings in order to maintain or increase our advertising revenues  to maintain subscriber fees and to maintain or improve our cash flow from operations 
in addition  our delivery of key demographics continues to be impacted by industry developments 
one potentially significant factor is the continued growth of time shifting digital video recording devices dvrs 
dvrs heighten the impact of competition as viewers are able to increase their access to what they consider to be new  compelling content 
the number of cable networks investing in original programming increased in  and acquired non original programming now represents only of the prime time cable programming 
although hallmark channel continues to invest in original programming  our increase in investment for original content did not match the growth of the market or many of our competitors 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve improved results 
although it is expected over time that our advertising revenue will increase  if we fail to significantly increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain improved results or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i a continued decline in viewer ratings mentioned above  ii the current economic environment presents uncertainty regarding the condition of the advertising marketplace and the financial health of many industry segments and individual companies  including those which advertise on our channels  iii we may be unable to reduce our average viewer age to be within our target audience of viewers between the ages of and  iv we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience  v our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  vi the advancement of technologies such as digital video recording may cause advertisers to shift their expenditures to media in which their commercial messages are not circumvented by the technology  and or vii we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots to fulfill guaranteed delivery numbers which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels and our number of subscribers 
current economic conditions have resulted in softness of advertising rates and may materially adversely impact our business 
in the second half of and during the first three quarters of  we experienced some softening of our general advertising rate prices and a more dramatic decrease in the rates of our direct response advertising because of economic conditions 
the volume of advertising has not been impacted 
see results of operations in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december   in this report for additional information on this subject 
in addition  the turmoil in the investment market  the tightening of credit and relatively high  increasing levels of unemployment in the united states have lead to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and possibly a reduction in business activity generally 
a continuation of these conditions could have the following negative effects  among others a reduction in spending by advertisers and consumers in general  which in turn could reduce our number of subscribers and or advertising rates  resulting in reduced revenue  and a further increase in bad debts or the reserve for bad debts 
these factors could make more difficult the goal of a continuing positive cash flow  any renewal of the bank credit facility and any financial restructuring 
hallmark entertainment investments controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark entertainment investments owns all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and  together with other affiliates of hallmark cards  owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock  representing in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
hallmark entertainment holdings  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  controls the voting of all our shares held by hallmark entertainment investments 
additionally  a significant portion of our overall indebtedness is held by hallmark cards or its wholly owned affiliates 
this control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of class a common stock 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
in addition  the control that hallmark cards and or these specific wholly owned affiliates may exert over us  either directly or indirectly  could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
after the recapitalization  hallmark cards will own of the outstanding common stock and will be subject to standstill and other provisions in a stockholder agreement as described earlier in this report 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark licensing  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  for use in the names of our channels 
this license will expire on september  if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including failure to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to our market  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 
if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
the amount of our goodwill may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity deficit could be materially adversely affected 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline  including the following any failure to recapitalize or restructure our outstanding indebtedness  failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of investors in any quarter  economic conditions that adversely affect our advertising rates or our number of subscribers  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  perceptions by the investing community or our customers with respect to the prospects of our company or our industry  changes in general market conditions or economic trends  and failure by us to renew major distribution agreements 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company s outstanding class a common stock  only million shares approximately  plus shares held by the directv group  inc and national interfaith cable coalition  are held by non affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company s class a common stock 
prior to entering into a new agreement on january   certain programming and other commitments in then existing agreements with the national interfaith cable coalition nicc would have terminated upon the sale of or more of the shares of class a common stock owned by nicc 
on january   we and nicc entered into a new agreement superseding prior agreements and terminating most programming relationships with nicc 
additionally  nicc owns approximately million shares of the company s class a common stock 
as a result of the agreement mentioned above  nicc has sold some of its class a common stock and may continue to do so  which could have an adverse impact on the share price of our class a common stock 
risks relating to our industry the recent change in the television rating system in the united states could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenue is partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
in  nielsen modified its ratings system by increasing its household sample size 
in the fourth quarter of  nielsen began measuring and providing performance data based on viewing of commercial content as well as programming content 
as the impact of the changes continue to take effect  our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample and the nature of the changes in the measurement systems 
from the beginning of the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of  we experienced a decrease in viewers of approximately under the new ratings measurement system compared to the system previously in use 
we continue to factor the new rating information into our advertising rates as nielsen is continually in the process of modifying its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies 
competition could reduce our channels revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  electronic games and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the communications industry may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to pressure pay tv channels having lower viewership  such as our channels  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channels without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our operating results and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and operating results  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position

the plaintiff is s 
muoio co 
llc which owns beneficially approximately of the company s class a common stock  according to the complaint and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the proposal  which the company publicly announced on may   provides for a recapitalization of its outstanding debt to hallmark cards affiliates in exchange for new debt and convertible preferred stock of the company 
the lawsuit claims to be a derivative action and a class action on behalf of the plaintiff and other minority stockholders of the company 
the lawsuit alleges  among other things  that  the defendants have breached fiduciary duties owed to the company and minority stockholders in connection with the proposal 
the lawsuit includes allegations that if the proposal is consummated  an unfair amount of equity would be issued to the majority stockholders  thereby reducing the minority stockholders equity and voting interests in the company  and that the majority stockholders would be able to eliminate the minority stockholders through a short form merger 
the complaint requests the court to enjoin the defendants from consummating the proposal and to award plaintiff fees and expenses incurred in bringing the lawsuit 
on july   a stipulation providing for notice of transaction the stipulation was filed with the delaware court of chancery 
the stipulation provided that the company cannot consummate the transaction contemplated in the proposal until not less than seven weeks after providing the plaintiff with a notice of the terms of the proposed transaction  including copies of the final transaction agreements

in addition  following the decision of the court of chancery  the company will not consummate any transaction for a period of at least one week  during which time any party may seek an expedited appeal 
the stipulation further provides that the plaintiff shall withdraw its motion for preliminary injunction filed on july  and that the action shall be stayed until the earlier of providing the notice of a transaction or an announcement by the company that it is no longer considering a transaction 
notice of the terms of the proposed recapitalization  including copies of the agreements  was provided to the plaintiff on march  by a letter of february   the plaintiff in this lawsuit informed the special committee of the board of directors  which considered and negotiated the recapitalization  that the plaintiff objected to the proposed recapitalization on the terms set forth in the term sheet dated february  the plaintiff asserted  among other things  that the transactions contemplated by the term sheet would unfairly dilute the economic and voting interests of the company s minority stockholders  that the transactions should be subject to a vote of the majority of the minority stockholders and that the proposed transactions remain inadequate 
the plaintiff indicated that if the company executed definitive documents for the recapitalization  the plaintiff would pursue the litigation 
the february   agreements executed by the company for the recapitalization followed the provisions in the earlier term sheet 
it is not currently possible to predict the outcome of the proceeding discussed in this report

current challenges the company faces numerous operating challenges 
among them are increasing viewership ratings  maintaining and increasing advertising revenue  maintaining and expanding the distribution of the channels  broadening viewership demographics to meet our target audience  and controlling costs and expenses 
in addition  the company believes that it is necessary to complete the recapitalization  see recapitalization in item  business and the liquidity discussion below in this item ratings ratings success plays a significant role in our ability to achieve our distribution and advertising goals 
our ratings declined from th in total day viewership and th for prime time in to th in total day viewership and th for prime time in we believe our ratings are affected by our ability to i acquire and produce series and movies that appeal to our target demographic and ii develop a programming schedule that attracts a high number of viewers 
original productions are our most high profile programs and generate the hallmark channel s highest ratings 
in the past  the company has typically incurred additional marketing and promotional expenses surrounding original productions and certain acquired movies to drive higher ratings 
certain acquired series delivered historically strong ratings  but recently they have been part of the decline experienced in viewer ratings 
in order to reverse the recent decline in ratings  we plan to continue or increase the number of our original productions and develop a programming schedule that attracts a greater number of viewers in our target demographic  all while controlling the expenses relating to these actions 
our recent acquisition of the broadcast rights of martha stewart living and our planned original productions for broadcast in are key parts of these plans 
the hallmark movie channel has not been the subject of ratings measurement by nielsen media research 
however  as currently planned  the hallmark movie channel will have nielsen ratings commencing in the second quarter of  and we will sell advertising inventory for the hallmark movie channel commencing in that quarter based on a price per unit of audience measurement 
advertising revenue continued weakness in the economy has resulted generally in lower demand and lower rates for our inventory of ad spots available for the scatter market and lower revenue from direct response advertising when comparing the year to the year 
notwithstanding the relatively higher cpms negotiated in the broadcast year upfront sales period versus the broadcast year upfront sales period  our advertising revenue for the year ended december   decreased relative to the year ended december   primarily because of lower viewer ratings and also because of lower rates in the scatter market 
with the shortfall in achieving viewership commitments  our liability for adus has increased significantly since december  in the upfront process  we entered agreements with major advertising firms representing approximately of our advertising inventory for the last quarter of and the first three quarters of this inventory was sold at cpms ie  advertising rates per thousand viewers approximately lower than the inventory sold in the upfront 
in the upfront sales process  we entered agreements for approximately of our advertising inventory for the last quarter of and the first three quarters of we held more advertising inventory from the upfront than the upfront  for use in the general scatter market  because of lower cpms offered by some advertisers in the upfront 
the company intends to sell the balance of the general rate inventory for the broadcast season to advertisers that purchase upfront inventory on a calendar year basis  rather than an advertising year basis  and in the scatter marketplace 
following the upfront period  sales of our general rate  direct response and paid programming inventory are made closer to the timing of the actual advertisement 
we have historically seen significant increases in rates on these remaining advertising sales over the rates obtained from our upfront sales 
as compared to the upfront sales for the same periods  scatters rates in were higher by the following percentages for the first quarter of  for the second quarter of  for the third quarter of  and for the fourth quarter of however  during the fourth quarter of and each of the quarters in rates for the scatter market and direct response advertising decreased when compared to the same periods in the prior year  except there was a slight increase in the fourth quarter of scatter rates as compared to the fourth quarter of scatter rates 
advertisers with upfront contracts have an option to terminate their contracts  as well as an option to expand the amount of inventory purchased under the contracts 
in prior years  cancellations of upfront contracts were unusual 
during the twelve months period ended september comprising the broadcast season  advertisers canceled approximately of the inventory covered by such contracts 
the company sold the balance of the general rate inventory  including that resulting from the cancellations  in the scatter market 
distribution agreements distribution agreements are important because they affect our number of subscribers  which in turn have a major impact on our subscriber fees  the number of persons viewing our programming  and the rates charged for advertising 
the long term distribution challenge is renewing our distribution arrangements with the multiple system operators as they expire on favorable terms 
our major distribution agreements have terms which expire at various times from december   through december  inclusive of renewal options 
an agreement with national cable televisions cooperative representing approximately of our total hallmark channel subscriber base expired in december the company is currently in negotiations with the national cable televisions cooperative to enter into a new agreement 
agreements representing an additional of our subscribers to our hallmark channel will expire prior to december  domestic telephone companies have entered the business of distributing television channels to households through their wire lines 
we have distribution agreements with several telephone companies for the carriage of the hallmark channel  the hallmark movie channel and hallmark movie channel hd  and continue to seek agreements with other telephone companies 
the universe of cable tv subscribers in the united states is approximately million homes 
the top cable tv networks in the united states  measured by the number of subscribers  have million or more subscribers 
our goal is for the hallmark channel to reach million subscribers and the hallmark movie channel to reach million subscribers in the next one to two years 
demographics as pay television channels draw audience share  audience demographics ie viewers categorized by characteristics such as age  sex and income become fragmented 
as a result  advertisers are able to target the specific groups of viewers who are most likely to purchase their products by buying advertising on channels which attract the desired viewer demographic 
we believe that the key demographics for the hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults aged to and women aged to however  the average median age of a viewer of the hallmark channel was in and in in order to achieve our revenue goals  we need to draw in our target audience 
the broadcast on the hallmark channel of martha stewart show and other martha stewart living productions  commencing in september  are a key part of our efforts to attract our target audience 
for additional information on demographics and viewer ratings  please see sources of revenue advertising revenue in item  business  and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results 
cost control we expect to continue experiencing increases in our bad debt expense during  which increases also occurred in  because of the economic downturn 
such increased expense is expected to result from certain customers  primarily advertisers  which will experience cash flow problems in this adverse economic environment 
we launched a high definition version of the hallmark channel in february the costs for this launch were approximately million  approximately million of which represents a non cash charge related to the terminations of two existing channel delivery agreements  which was recorded in this amount is subject to change based upon several factors 
the company may also incur additional costs including the cost of converting certain television series to high definition 
the launch of a high definition version will further the company s efforts to maintain competitiveness 
revenue from continuing operations our revenue consists primarily of subscriber fees and advertising fees 
for the years ended december   and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the channels was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and revenue from the sale of advertising time on our channels were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
information relating to subscriber fees and advertising fees is presented above in item business sources of revenue cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the amortization of program license fees  the cost of signal distribution  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
see the discussion of programming costs in results of operations below 
see also discussion of operating costs in results of operations below for an anticipated increase in the operating costs for the first quarter of due to the costs of launching a high definition version of the hallmark channel 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires crown media holdings to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for further information regarding our critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  please see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
program license fees program license fees are paid in connection with the acquisition of the rights to air programs acquired from others 
the cost of program rights are deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their contractual license periods or anticipated usage 
on a yearly basis  the company evaluates the realizability of these deferred license fees in relation to the estimated future revenue 
estimates of net realizable value for program license fees are determined using future estimated advertising revenue and anticipated patterns of programming usage on a day part basis blocks of time during the day as it pertains to programming licensed to a channel 
these estimates of expected annual future estimated revenue are compared to net book value of the program license fee assets to determine if the programming assets are expected to be recovered 
where the analysis indicates the costs are in excess of the estimated net realizable value  additional programming costs are immediately recognized in the amount of the excess 
goodwill at december   the company had a stockholders deficit of million and a goodwill asset of million 
all of our goodwill relates to our domestic channel operations segment within crown media united states  which is also our only reporting unit 
the company s market capitalization exceeds the negative carrying value of the reporting unit 
we performed our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets as of november using a market approach to determine fair value 
in our market approach  we identified publicly traded companies whose business and financial risks are comparable to ours 
we then compared the market values of those companies to our calculated value 
we also identified recent sales of companies in lines of business similar to ours and compared the sales prices in those transactions to the calculated value of ours 
we also used the discounted cash flow analysis approach to validate the fair value determined by our market approach 
the values determined in our discounted cash flow analysis corroborated the value calculated in our market approach 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit for the step test using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the cash flow projections the cash flow projections used in our analysis were prepared by management and represent management s estimate of the future cash flows to be generated by operations during through years 
for the years ended december   revenue grew at an annual growth rate of approximately 
our gross margin increased over the same time period from a negative to a positive 
given the downturn in the economy in  management determined that it was prudent to adjust the growth rates used in the cash flow projections 
therefore  the cash flow projections include growth rates which are lower than historical growth rates and lower than the growth rates used in our cash flow projections 
the growth rates used in the cash flow projections are considered by management to be appropriate and reflect the current state of the economy 
the cash flow projections include many assumptions  including assumptions regarding the timing of an economic recovery and the impact of any such recovery on operations 
in this regard  the cash flow projections are based on the economy stabilizing and growing modestly in and that the economy is somewhat more normalized in the years beyond the projected cash flows were discounted using a blended discount rate of  which represents an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital 
the weighted average cost of capital incorporates risk premiums that reflect the current economic environment 
such discount rate is higher than the rate used in prior years due to changes in the marketplace for credit and risk premiums 
terminal growth rates the approximation of ongoing growth rates after year consider the above noted factors for the initial five years forecasted cash flows and forecasted cpi increases 
we also reconcile the estimated fair value of our reporting unit to our market capitalization 
as long as we continue to have a stockholders deficit and only one reporting unit  we believe it is unlikely we would have a goodwill impairment 
however  ignoring that our positive market capitalization exceeds our shareholders deficit  we have discussed below the sensitivity of our discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimated fair value determined in our step test was in excess of the reporting unit s carrying value  and accordingly no step test was performed and no impairment charge was recorded 
we note that if our fair value estimate was lower  we would still not have triggered a step failure and no impairment charge would be taken 
the foregoing impairment test requires a high degree of judgment with respect to estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions 
therefore  any value ultimately derived may differ from our estimate of fair value 
further  if the environment continues to experience recessionary pressures for an extended period of time  our cash flow projections will need to be revised downward and we could have impairment charges in the future 
in this regard  we estimate that if we were to use a compound annual growth rate for revenue that is approximately to lower than the rate currently used in the cash flow projections and that we achieved the margins assumed in the cash flow projections  we could in the future fail the step test and would be required to perform the step test to measure any impairment of goodwill 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
revenue recognition subscriber revenue from pay television distributors is recognized as revenue when an agreement is executed  programming is provided  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
subscriber fees from pay television distributors are recorded net of amortization of subscriber acquisition costs 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
advertising revenue  net of agency commissions  is recognized in the period in which related commercial spots or long form programming are aired and as ratings guarantees to advertisers are achieved 
agency commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for the company s broadcasting operations 
customers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings less their commission to the company 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue or audience deficiency units 
audience deficiency unit liability audience deficiency units adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as fulfillment for the inventory the advertiser purchased that ran in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed ratings 
an audience deficiency liability results when impressions delivered on guaranteed ratings are less than the impressions guaranteed to advertisers 
such liability arises as a matter of industry practice rather than as a matter of written contract 
the liability is reduced when the company airs the advertisement during another program to make good on the under delivery of impressions 
the company typically does not remit cash to advertisers in satisfaction of such deficiencies 
effects of transactions with related and certain other parties hallmark transactions in and in prior years  we entered into a number of significant transactions with hallmark cards and its subsidiaries 
these transactions include  among other things  trademark licenses  and administrative services agreement  a tax sharing agreement  the issuance of a million senior note  notes payable and the amended waiver and standby agreement 
a summary of the terms and financial impact of these transactions is described below in item certain relationships and related transactions which is incorporated by reference into this item certain of these agreements would be modified if the recapitalization were implemented

primetime is defined as pm in the united states 
these nielsen ratings are for the time period january through december results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue from continuing operations  comprised primarily of subscriber and advertising fees  decreased million or in over our subscriber fee revenue increased million or 
the amount of subscriber acquisition fees that was recorded as a reduction of subscriber fee revenue was approximately million and million for and  respectively 
subscriber revenue increased in primarily due to an increase in the number of hallmark channel pay subscribers and small contractual rate increases 
the million or decrease in advertising revenue is primarily due to declines in viewer ratings across demographic categories for compared audience deficiency unit revenue decreased million from revenue of million for  to contra revenue of million for the same period in as a result of such ratings declines  leading to a corresponding decrease in revenue recognized by the company 
we believe that recent changes to our program schedule  along with increased competition including the availability of high definition distribution by competitors  contributed to a decline in ratings 
from until early  our programming schedule did not change significantly 
beginning in  a number of programs that had previously received strong ratings began to experience ratings declines  and we placed television series in certain timeslots instead of movies or original productions 
also  a number of programs in the schedule provided strong household ratings performance but less effective delivery of our key demographic  women age in  we began to introduce new content into the schedule with the objective of increasing the delivery of women the schedule changes likely resulted in some viewer confusion and did result in lower ratings 
we continue to experience success in select dayparts  and we will continue to focus on program acquisitions  original program production and schedule changes that are intended to improve both the viewer ratings and the demographic delivery of the hallmark channel 
the fact that hallmark channel was not broadcast in high definition may have had a negative impact on ratings in of the top advertising supported cable networks with a household rating or higher in prime time  only six of those networks including hallmark channel were not offered in high definition 
of those six networks  three experienced double digit ratings decreases in compared to and three experienced single digit increases 
in  of viewers with access to high definition programming services tuned to those high definition services first 
the growth in popularity of high definition programming is expected to continue in and beyond  and these high definition trends are part of our decision to launch hallmark channel in high definition in february the year also represented a year of increased competition within cable television 
the number of cable networks investing in original programming increased in  and acquired non original programming now represents only of prime time cable programming 
although hallmark channel continues to invest in original programming  our increase in investment for original content did not match the growth of the market or many of our competitors 
the impact of the programming competition is heightened by the continued growth of time shifting digital video recording devices  or dvr s 
with the proliferation of these devices  viewers are able to increase their access to the new  compelling content 
for the year ended december   nielsen ranked the hallmark channel th in total day viewership with a household rating and th in primetime with a household rating among the cable channels in the united states market 
cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decrease results primarily from the effects of the decrease in programming costs  discussed below  offset in part by the decrease in advertising revenue discussed above 
programming costs decreased million or from in the second and third quarters of  we entered into agreements to amend significant programming agreements which added programs and deferred certain payments for programming content to periods beyond some of the agreements resulted in the extension of related program licenses to cover slightly longer periods of availability  the deferral of expected delivery of certain programming and the deferral of certain payments primarily from until upon the amendment of the agreements  we prospectively changed the amortization of program license fees for any changes in the period of expected usage and or changes in license fees 
the effects of these amendments on amortization were not significant 
additionally  we returned our exclusivity rights to one title  which resulted in a lower asset and liability balance 
during the first quarter of  we also entered into amendments to some of our original programming agreements which extended the current license period to those titles  and thus  resulted in lower amortization in compared to additionally  during  we did not enter into any significant new third party license agreements  so expiring program rights and the related amortization were not replaced in full with assets and amortization from newer license agreements 
operating costs for increased million over due in part to the million increase in bad debt expense and the  of severance expense recorded in may related to one executive s resignation 
the company s bad debt expense was million for  as compared to  for the increase in bad debt expense is due to certain advertising customers experiencing cash flow problems under current economic conditions 
the company will continue to monitor cash collections as part of estimating this expense 
additionally  the company recorded negative film amortization of  in that resulted principally from the company s periodic reassessment and eventual payment of its liabilities for residuals and participations associated with the company s third party licensing and self use of the company s film library prior to the sale of the company s international film rights in april and the company s domestic film rights in december during the fourth quarter of  we negotiated the termination of two channel delivery agreements related to the launch of the hallmark channel into high definition 
the estimated costs of termination were approximately million 
we may incur additional costs during to obtain high definition versions of certain of our programming 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense increased slightly year over year 
the company recorded million of severance expense associated with the resignation of its president on may  the company also recorded million of severance expense associated with the termination of employees in august these increases in expense were offset by decreases in the travel  communication  and rsu related expenses 
travel and communication events related expenses decreased approximately million period over period 
additionally  the company recorded million of compensation expense associated with rsus during  as compared to  of compensation benefit associated with rsus for see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report

our marketing expense decreased in versus during  we invested in five significant marketing promotions 
the five marketing promotions were centered around the original movies the good witch in january  bridal fever in february  a gunfighter s pledge in july  and both old fashioned thanksgiving and moonlight and mistletoe in november the company had one significant marketing promotion in january centered around the original movie  taking a chance on love 
as part of our contingency cost reduction efforts  promotional and marketing efforts were reduced overall during compared to marketing expenses may increase in to promote the hallmark channel s programming schedule  including the martha stewart living productions 
gain from sale of film assets 
in december the company concluded that payments for residuals and participations  which are liabilities from the company s december sale of its film assets  would occur generally later than originally estimated in december accordingly  the company reduced the carrying amount of the liability by  and recognized a corresponding gain from sale of film assets in the accompanying statement of operations 
interest expense 
interest expense in increased  compared to the principal balance under our credit facility was million at december   and million at december  the interest rate on our bank credit facility increased from at december   to at december  interest rates on our  and notes decreased from at december   to at december  the benefit of these rate decreases was offset by a higher principal balance on the senior secured note  resulting in interest expense for being nearly the same as for gain on sale of discontinued operations 
the terms of our april sale of the international business require that we reimburse the buyer for its cost of residuals and participations incurred in connection with the its exploitation of the related international film rights through april  at the time of the sale  we recorded an estimate of our liability for this obligation and considered the amount in our determination of our loss from the sale of discontinued operations as reported in during the fourth quarter of  the buyer requested us to reimburse it for such obligations incurred in connection with its exploitation of these films through december  using the historical information provided by the buyer  we reduced the estimate of our remaining liability as of december   by million 
this change in estimate was reflected as a million gain on sale of discontinued operations and a million decrease in interest expense 
termination of one agreement relating to channel delivery also resulted in a change in the estimated life of the deferred credit for playback services 
after termination of services  there is no longer a recurring monthly expense for compression and uplink services 
accordingly  the adjustment to eliminate the unneeded portion of the deferred credit of approximately  was recognized during the fourth quarter of through december   the aggregate loss on sale of the international business is million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue from continuing operations  comprised primarily of subscriber fees and advertising  increased million or in over our subscriber fee revenue increased million or as a result of an increase in the number of paying subscribers  significantly improved subscriber fee rates following renewal of all of our major distribution agreements in and  and a significant reduction in the amount of subscriber acquisition fees netted against gross subscriber revenue 
the renewed distribution agreements also sharply reduced the subscriber acquisition fees we must pay our distributors for carriage of our channels 
the amount of subscriber acquisition fees that was recorded as a reduction of subscriber fee revenue decline from million in to million in  reflecting the system by system effect of increased subscriber fee rates and reduced subscriber acquisition fees 
the million or increase in advertising revenue reflects an increase in advertising rates along with improved delivery of committed viewership ratings and increase in the number of available general rate ad spots  offset in part by a decrease in the effectiveness of direct response advertising 
the hallmark movie channel contributed million of the increase 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of we experienced a softening of advertising rates in the scatter and direct response markets as a result of deteriorating national economic conditions 
this softening continued throughout the relative decrease in advertising revenue in the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of was greater than the seasonal decrease we would typically have expected 
advertising revenue for the fourth quarter of was million compared to million in the fourth quarter of we were not significantly affected by cancellations under advertising contracts 
in response to the lower advertising rates  starting in the third quarter of  we reduced the amount of time allotted to on air self promotion and increased the time available for paid advertising 
the volume of advertising did not decrease 
for  nielsen ranked the hallmark channel th in total day viewership with a household rating and th in primetime with a household rating among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market 
although we had an increase in distribution to the nielsen universe of approximately in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of  our household ratings were down for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of we believe that the reasons for this circumstance include significant sample adjustments to viewers in determining ratings  a shift of viewers to cable news channels during the unprecedented media coverage of the national elections and the economic crisis 
our year to date household ratings were also down slightly due to the summer olympics 
cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decrease resulted from the combined effects of the increase in revenue  discussed above  and the decrease in subscriber amortization fee amortization expense discussed below 
programming costs decreased million or from largely as a result of the december   expiration of our programming agreement with nicc and our efforts to manage costs 
this was offset in part by our licensing of hallmark hall of fame movies under a new agreement with hallmark cards that provides year exhibition windows for all licensed films 
during the third quarter of  we entered into amendments to significant programming agreements which added programming and deferred certain payments of for program content to periods beyond subscriber acquisition fee amortization expense resulted from subscriber acquisition costs incurred previously by us and amortized over the remaining life of the relevant distribution agreement 
subscriber acquisition fee amortization expense decreased as all of the expense was netted against revenue in the company s three largest affiliation agreements became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of as they expired and renewal agreements were executed 
negative film amortization of million and  in and  respectively  resulted principally from the company s periodic reassessment and eventual payment of its liabilities for residuals and participations associated with the company s third party licensing and self use of it film library prior to the sale of its international film rights in april and its domestic film rights in december in  such favorable adjustments amounted to  in the second quarter and million in the third quarter 
in  such adjustment amounted to million in the third quarter 
operating costs in increased million over primarily due to a  increase in expenses associated with the distribution of the hallmark movie channel hd in high definition format and the  increase in salaries and benefits expense related to cost of living adjustments 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense decreased million or 
contributing to this favorable change were decreases of million in rsu expense and million in sar expense 
also contributing was a million decrease in legal expense  following our january settlement with nicc which was reflected in the year 
marketing expense 
our marketing expense decreased 
during  we invested in five significant marketing promotions 
the five marketing promotions were centered around the original movies love is a four letter word in february  a stranger s heart in may  avenging angel in july  all i want for christmas in december and the note in december the company also had five significant marketing promotions in centered around the original movies the good witch in january  bridal fever in february  a gunfighter s pledge in july  and both old fashioned thanksgiving and moonlight and mistletoe in november total amounts spent for the five significant marketing promotions were lower in as compared to in addition to the radio  television  print and online advertising included in the significant marketing promotions  we executed a multi market event to drive press coverage  viewer awareness and tune in to the movie 
the company also engaged in other smaller  promotional activities throughout and  with lower expenditures for these activities in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense in decreased million compared to the principal balance of our credit facility decreased from million at december   to million at december   to million at december  the interest rate on our bank credit facility decreased from at december   to at december  the benefit of this rate decrease was offset in part by higher principal balances on four of the five notes payable to hallmark affiliates 
additionally  on april   the tax note was credited million for the company s share of an irs interest refund that hallmark cards received 
this refund of interest reduced the balance of the tax note 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million of interest expense related to the tax note 
see information on the tax note in bank credit facility and hallmark notes note and interest payable to hallmark cards below 
interest expense in also included a million reduction to give effect to our change in the estimate of our indemnification liability to the buyer of our international business as described in the next paragraph gain on sale of discontinued operations 
the terms of our april sale of the international business require that we reimburse the buyer for its cost of residuals and participations incurred in connection with the its exploitation of the related international film rights through april  at the time of the sale  we recorded an estimate of our liability for this obligation and considered the amount in our determination of our loss from the sale of discontinued operations as reported in during the fourth quarter of  the buyer requested us to reimburse it for such obligations incurred in connection with its exploitation of these films through december  using the historical information provided by the buyer  we reduced the estimate of our remaining liability as of december   by million 
this change in estimate was reflected as a million gain on sale of discontinued operations and a million decrease in interest expense 
through december   the aggregate loss on sale of the international business was million 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  compared to year ended december  in  our operating activities provided million of cash compared to million of in the company s net loss for the year ended december   decreased million to million from million for the year ended december  our depreciation and amortization expense for decreased million to million from million in the company had lower additions to program license fees in as compared to due to amendments to agreements with certain third party programming suppliers during to add programming content 
pursuant to the waiver agreement  the company paid million for interest on the  and notes that accrued november   through september  the company made programming payments of million and million in and  respectively

cash used in financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
we borrowed million and million under our credit facility to supplement the cash requirements of our operating and investing activities in and  respectively 
we repaid principal of million and million under our bank credit facility in and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  in  our operating activities provided million of cash compared to million of in the most significant contribution to this favorable change of million was the increase in operating cash receipts from million to million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  the company s net loss for the year ended december   decreased million to million from million for the year ended december  our depreciation and amortization expense for decreased million to million from million in the company had higher additions to program license fees in as compared to due to amendments to agreements with certain third party programming suppliers during to add programming content

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the future cash disbursements to which we are contractually committed as of december  scheduled payments by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years after years credit facility and interest payable company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred interest  including accretion senior secured note to hc crown  including accrued interest notes and interest payable to hallmark cards affiliates capital lease obligations operating leases other obligations program license fees payable for non affiliate current and future windows program license fees payable for hallmark cards affiliate current and future windows funding of original productions subscriber acquisition fees obligations to nicc due to january  agreement deferred compensation and interest payable to buyer of international business other payables to buyer of international business other payables to buyer of film assets total contractual cash obligations includes future interest 
subsequent to the balance sheet date  the termination dates were extended to august  these amounts do not contain interest for the period may through august  the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred interest is to be redeemed on or before december  the amounts and timing for certain of these commitments are contingent upon the future delivery date and type of programming produced  and  as such  the estimated amount and timing may change 
contains airing windows that open subsequent to year end and  therefore  the liability is not included on the balance sheet as of december  pursuant to the january   agreement  the company paid nicc million in january also  the company made a payment based on the outstanding balance of the visn preferred interest in crown media united states in january cash flows as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand and million of borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility 
on march   the company and the bank set the maximum amount that could be borrowed under the bank credit facility at million and extended the maturity date to august  after this amendment  the company had million of current borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility 
day to day cash disbursement requirements have typically been satisfied with cash on hand and operating cash receipts supplemented with the borrowing capacity available under the bank credit facility and forbearance by hallmark cards and its affiliates 
the company s management anticipates that the principal uses of cash up to august   will include the payment of operating expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses  programming costs  costs incurred in connection with the recapitalization  interest and repayment of principal under the bank credit facility and interest of approximately million to million due under certain notes to hallmark cards affiliates from january through august  the amounts outstanding under the bank credit agreement and those notes to hallmark affiliates are due august  as discussed below 
the company generated positive cash flows from operating activities for each of the years ended december   and as indicated below  there can be no assurance that the company s operating activities will generate positive cash flow in future periods 
another significant aspect of the company s liquidity is the deferral of payments on obligations owed to hallmark cards and its subsidiaries 
under the amended and restated waiver agreement as amended with hallmark cards and its affiliates the waiver agreement  the deferred payments under such obligations are extended to august  these obligations comprised million at december  an additional million senior secured note of principal and interest outstanding at december   payable to a hallmark cards affiliate in august  is also subject to the waiver agreement until august  interest amounts related to the note will be added to principal through august  the deferral of payments under the waiver agreement terminates on august  hallmark cards and its affiliates have no obligation  and have stated no intent  to extend this termination date 
the note purchase agreement for the senior note provides that if there is an event of default with respect to any other indebtedness in excess of million  the accreted value and any accrued and unpaid interest on the senior note would become due and payable 
the company s ability to pay amounts outstanding under the bank credit facility on the maturity date is highly dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient  timely cash flow from operations between january and august  based on the company s forecasts for  which assume no principal payments on notes payable to hallmark cards and its affiliates  the company would have sufficient cash to repay all or most of the bank credit facility on the maturity date  if necessary 
however  there is uncertainty regarding the company s future advertising revenues  so it is possible that cash flows may be less than the expectations of the company s management 
upon maturity of the credit facility on august   to the extent the facility has not been paid in full  renewed or replaced  the company could exercise its option under the waiver agreement and require hallmark cards to purchase the interest of the lending bank in the facility 
in that case  hallmark cards would have all the obligations and rights of the lending bank under the bank credit facility and could demand payment of outstanding amounts at any time after august   under the terms of the waiver agreement 
the company believes that cash on hand  cash generated by operations  and borrowing availability under its bank credit facility through august   when combined with the deferral of otherwise required payments under the senior secured note related party debt and the tax sharing agreement  and if necessary  hallmark cards purchase of any outstanding indebtedness under the bank credit facility on august  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and enable the company to meet its liquidity needs until the earlier of august  or the closing of the recapitalization described above 
the company has entered into the master recapitalization agreement for the recapitalization transactions  including the exchange of existing debt owed to h c crown corp 
for new debt  preferred stock and common stock 
it is a condition of the recapitalization that the company have obtained a revolving credit facility from a third party lender  guaranteed by hallmark cards or one of its affiliates  with a term of not less than days of the closing date of the recapitalization  with the availability of at least million and on other terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the company 
if the recapitalization is closed as contemplated at this time  the company believes that cash on hand  cash generated by operations and borrowing availability under the contemplated revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and enable the company to meet its liquidity needs until at least march  the form of credit agreement with hcc and other hallmark card affiliates in the recapitalization requires that  prior to closing of the credit agreement  the company establish with a financial institution a reserve account called the nicc reserve account in the company s name for amounts that the company may choose as a sinking fund with respect to the million payable by december   for the redemption of the preferred interest in crown media united states 
the preferred interest is held by visn management corp 
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of national interfaith cable coalition 
at no time may the amounts in the nicc reserve account exceed million 
in order to redeem the preferred interest  the company may need to borrow up to million under the bank credit facility 
the sufficiency of the existing sources of liquidity to fund the company s operations is dependent upon maintaining subscriber and advertising revenue at or near the amount of such revenue for the year ended december  a significant decline in the popularity of the channels  a further economic decline in the advertising market  an increase in program acquisition costs  an increase in competition or other adverse changes in operating conditions could negatively impact the company s liquidity and its ability to fund the current level of operations 
the closing of the recapitalization is subject to a number of conditions  including  among other things  a representations and warranties of the company being accurate  b obtaining the revolving credit agreement mentioned above  c no judgment or order which prohibits the consummation of the recapitalization and d hallmark cards not having delivered a written notice to the company certifying that hallmark cards in its sole discretion shall have determined that the status of any pending or threatened litigation or regulatory proceeding involving the company or its subsidiaries in connection with the recapitalization is unsatisfactory to hallmark cards 
if for any reason the recapitalization is not consummated  the company would be unable to meet its obligations which become due on august   which provides substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue 
in addition  it is unlikely that the company could obtain  without a guarantee or other support of hallmark cards  other equity or debt financing prior to august  in order to replace or refinance obligations becoming due on that date 
this is the view of the special committee which considered and negotiated the recapitalization 
accordingly  the company believes the ability of the company to continue its operations depends upon completion of the recapitalization 
the special committee of the board believes that the recapitalization is fair to the stockholders other than hallmark cards and its affiliates and in the best interest of the company 
bank credit facility and hallmark notes in  we entered into a credit agreement which agreement has been amended subsequently  with the most recent amendment dated march  with a syndicate of banks  led by jp morgan chase bank  na as administrative agent and issuing bank 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries  is secured by all tangible and intangible property of crown media holdings and its subsidiaries  and is guaranteed by hallmark cards

each loan under the bank credit facility bears interest at a eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate as we may request at the time of borrowing 
the eurodollar rate is based on the london interbank market for eurodollars  and remains in effect for the time period of the loan ranging from one  two  three  six or twelve months 
the alternate rate is based upon the prime rate of jp morgan chase bank  a certificate of deposit rate or the federal funds effective rate  which is adjusted whenever the rates change 
we were required to pay a commitment fee of per annum of the committed  but not outstanding  amounts under the revolving credit facility  payable in quarterly installments 
pursuant to amendment no 
 the commitment fee of per annum was increased to per annum  which results in no increase to us because the difference was previously paid by us to hallmark cards

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will decline in value if there is an increase in interest rates

consequently  the size of this portfolio is nominal and fluctuates as cash is provided by and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations
