item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we currently operate in three primary business segments manufacturing  wheel services  refurbishment parts and leasing services 
these three business segments are operationally integrated 
the manufacturing segment  operating from four facilities in the united states  mexico and poland  produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  tank cars and marine vessels 
the wheel services  refurbishment parts segment performs railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities in the united states and mexico as well as wheel  axle and bearing servicing  and production and reconditioning of a variety of parts for the railroad industry 
the leasing services segment owns approximately  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers  institutional investors and other leasing and transportation companies in north america 
management evaluates segment performance based on margins 
we also produce rail castings through an unconsolidated joint venture 
the rail and marine industries are cyclical in nature 
we are starting to see signs of a recovery in the freight car markets in which we operate 
demand for our marine barge products remains soft 
customer orders may be subject to cancellations and contain terms and conditions customary in the industry 
until recently  little variation has been experienced between the quantity ordered and the quantity actually delivered 
economic conditions have caused some customers to seek to renegotiate  delay or cancel orders 
our railcar and marine backlogs are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
in december we modified our long term new railcar contract with general electric railcar services corporation ge 
under the terms of the modified contract  we will deliver up to  railcars with the first  tank cars and hopper cars expected to be built by july the purchase price is subject to adjustments for changes in the material costs 
the remaining  tank and hopper cars are subject to fulfillment of certain contractual conditions by both parties in their sole discretion and would occur over the five year period following the completion of the  units 
in addition  we have retained the right of first refusal  subject to certain qualifications  to manufacture all new railcar builds for ge through december we have agreed to share in an equitable manner with greenbrier gimsa llc  of which we own  the benefits net of any expenses received from ge as a result of the amended agreement 
multi year supply agreements are a part of rail industry practice 
our total manufacturing backlog of railcars as of august  was approximately  units with an estimated value of million compared to  units valued at billion as of august  the august  backlog did not include approximately units valued at million scheduled for production in these units are contractually committed to third party lessees and are expected to be placed into our lease fleet 
based on current production plans  approximately  units in the august  backlog are scheduled for delivery in fiscal year the balance of the production is scheduled for delivery through fiscal year the august  backlog does not include the contingent production of  units for ge 
a portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix 
under terms of the orders  the exact mix will be determined in the future which may impact the dollar amount of backlog 
subsequent to year end we received new railcar orders for  units with an aggregate value of approximately million 
these units are scheduled for delivery in fiscal year marine backlog was approximately million as of august  with production scheduled through fiscal year during the quarter ended august   we removed approximately million of marine vessels from backlog  due to the current likelihood that these vessels will not be produced and sold as a result of current economic conditions 
marine backlog was approximately million as of august  prices for steel  a primary component of railcars and barges  and related surcharges have fluctuated significantly and remain volatile 
in addition  the price of certain railcar components  which are a product of steel  are affected by steel price fluctuations 
new railcar and marine backlog generally either includes fixed price contracts which anticipate material price increases and surcharges  or contracts that contain actual or formulaic pass through of material price increases and surcharges 
we are aggressively working to mitigate these exposures 
the company s integrated business model has helped offset some of the effects of fluctuating steel and scrap steel prices  as a the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents portion of our business segments benefit from rising steel scrap prices while other segments benefit from lower steel and scrap steel prices through enhanced margins 
in april  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec  using a shelf registration process 
the registration statement was declared effective on april  and pursuant to the prospectus filed as part of the registration statement  we may sell from time to time any combination of securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate amount of million 
the securities described in the prospectus include common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  guarantees  rights  and units 
we may also offer common stock or preferred stock upon conversion of debt securities  common stock upon conversion of preferred stock  or common stock  preferred stock or debt securities upon the exercise of warrants or rights 
each time we sell securities under the shelf  we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes including  among other things  working capital  financings  possible acquisitions  the repayment of obligations that have matured  and reducing or refinancing indebtedness that may be outstanding at the time of any offering 
on may   we issued  shares of our common stock under the shelf registration statement at a price of per share  less underwriting commissions  discounts and expenses 
on may   an additional  shares were issued under the shelf registration statement pursuant to the day over allotment option exercised by the underwriters 
management has broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of million from the offering for such purposes as working capital  capital expenditures  repayment or repurchase of a portion of our indebtedness or acquisitions of  or investment in  complementary businesses and products 
on march   our then subsidiary trentonworks ltd 
trentonworks filed for bankruptcy with the office of the superintendent of bankruptcy canada whereby the assets of trentonworks were administered and liquidated by an appointed trustee 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the bankruptcy was resolved upon liquidation of substantially all remaining assets of trentonworks by the bankruptcy trustee 
the resolution of the bankruptcy and associated release of obligations resulted in the recognition of million in income in  consisting of the reversal of the million liability  net of a million other comprehensive loss 
this income was recorded in special items on the consolidated statement of operations 
in april  wlr greenbrier rail inc wlr gbx was formed and acquired a lease fleet of nearly  railcars valued at approximately million 
wlr gbx is wholly owned by affiliates of wl ross co  llc 
we paid a million contract placement fee to wlr gbx for the right to perform certain management and advisory services and in exchange will receive management and other fee income and incentive compensation tied to the performance of wlr gbx 
the contract placement fee is accounted for under the equity method and is recorded in intangibles and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
a million gain on extinguishment of debt was recorded on the early retirement of million of convertible senior notes in fiscal this gain was partially offset by million for the proportionate write off of associated loan fees 
we delivered railcar units during fiscal year for which we have an obligation to guarantee the purchaser minimum earnings 
the obligation expires december  the maximum potential obligation totals million and in certain defined instances the obligation may be reduced due to early termination 
the purchaser has agreed to utilize the railcars on a preferential basis  and we are entitled to re market the railcar units when they are not being utilized by the purchaser during the obligation period 
any earnings generated from the railcar units will offset the obligation and be recognized as revenue and margin in future periods 
as a result of re marketing the railcars  we recorded revenue of million for the year ended august  upon delivery of the railcar units  the entire purchase price was recorded as revenue and paid in full 
the minimum earnings due to the purchaser are considered a reduction of revenue and were recorded as deferred revenue 
as of august   million of the potential obligation remained in deferred revenue

manufacturing segment manufacturing revenue includes new railcar and marine production 
new railcar delivery and backlog information disclosed herein includes all facilities 
manufacturing revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and railcar deliveries  which are the primary source of manufacturing revenue  were approximately  units in compared to  units in and  units in manufacturing revenue decreased million  or  from to primarily due to a decline in marine barge production  lower railcar deliveries and a change in railcar product mix with lower per unit sales prices 
revenue was reduced by an million obligation of guaranteed minimum earnings under a certain contract 
manufacturing revenue decreased million  or  from to primarily due to lower railcar deliveries and the million obligation of guaranteed minimum earnings under a certain contract 
the decrease was somewhat offset by a change in product mix with higher per unit sales prices and higher marine revenues 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the increase was primarily the result of a more favorable product mix and improved production efficiencies at our mexican joint venture 
the current year was positively impacted by the re marketing of railcars that were subject to guaranteed minimum earnings under a certain contract in the prior year 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease was primarily the result of the million obligation of guaranteed minimum earnings under a certain contract  higher material costs and scrap surcharge expense  severance expense of million and less absorption of overhead due to lower production levels and plant utilization 
these were partially offset by improved marine margins as a result of labor efficiencies and a continuous run of similar barge types 
wheel services  refurbishment parts segment wheel services  refurbishment parts revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million decrease in revenue from to was primarily due to lower sales volumes of wheels and reduced volumes of railcar repair and refurbishment work 
this was offset slightly by improvement in the price for scrap metal 
the million decrease in revenue from to was primarily due to lower wheel and parts volumes  reduced volumes of railcar repair and refurbishment work  a sharp decrease in scrap metal pricing and lower wheelset pricing 
wheel services  refurbishment parts margin as a percentage of revenue was for both and  and for the decrease in fiscal margins was primarily due to lower net scrap pricing and less favorable mix of repair and refurbishment work 
leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million decrease in revenue from to was primarily the result of lower rent generated from the lease fleet principally offset by higher gains on sale of assets from the lease fleet 
the million decrease in revenue from to was primarily the result of a million decrease in gains on the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents disposition of assets from the lease fleet  lower lease fleet utilization  downward pressures on lease renewal rates  lower earnings on certain car hire utilization leases and lower maintenance revenues 
during  we realized million in gains on sale for the disposition of leased equipment compared to million in and million in assets from our lease fleet are periodically sold in the normal course of business in order to take advantage of market conditions  manage risk and maintain liquidity 
leasing services margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in and in the increase in was primarily the result of increased gains on sale of assets from the lease fleet which has no associated cost of revenue 
the decrease from to was primarily the result of decreases in gains on disposition of assets from the fleet  which have no associated cost of revenue  lower lease fleet utilization  downward pressure on lease renewal rates and lower earnings on certain car hire utilization leases 
the percentage of owned units on lease as of august  was compared to at august  other costs selling and administrative expense was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million increase from to is primarily due to higher depreciation expense associated with our on going erp improvement projects  higher consulting and travel expenses and increased costs at our mexican joint venture due to higher activity levels 
these were partially offset by lower employee costs 
the million decrease from to is primarily due to lower employee related costs  including cost reduction efforts and reversal of million of certain accruals 
the decrease was partially offset by severance costs of million related to reductions in work force 
interest and foreign exchange expense was million and million for the years ended august  and years ended august  increase in thousands decrease interest and foreign exchange interest and other expense accretion of term loan debt discount accretion of convertible debt discount gain on debt extinguishment write off of fees and debt discount on debt prepayment foreign exchange loss the increase in term loan debt discount accretion  associated with the term loan issued in june  was due to a full year of accretion in compared to only a partial year in the greenbrier companies annual report

the debt discount accretion expense was million associated with the term loan issued in june in april  the company s board of directors approved the permanent closure of the company s then canadian railcar manufacturing subsidiary  trentonworks 
as a result of the facility closure decision charges of million were recorded as special items during in march  trentonworks filed for bankruptcy 
in the fourth quarter of  the bankruptcy was resolved upon liquidation of substantially all remaining assets 
the resolution of the bankruptcy resulted in income of million which was recorded in special items 
charges of million were recorded to special items in may associated with the impairment of goodwill 
these charges consist of million related to the manufacturing segment  million related to the leasing services segment and million related to the wheel services  refurbishment parts segment 
income tax in we recorded a tax benefit of million on million of earnings for the year 
the current year included income of million from a special item associated with the resolution of the bankruptcy of our then canadian railcar manufacturing subsidiary  trentonworks which was not taxable 
in addition  an income tax liability was not recorded on the noncontrolling interest earnings of million from a consolidated subsidiary that is a flow through entity for tax purposes 
earnings from flow through entities are only taxed at the owner s level 
excluding these items the effective tax rate would have been 
our effective tax rate was and for the years ended august  and in a goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was recorded at  as a portion of the impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  included a reversal of million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities  a tax benefit of million related to the deemed liquidation of our german operation for us tax purposes and a tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability associated with a foreign subsidiary 
excluding these items the effective tax rate would have been 
tax expense for included a million charge associated with deferred tax assets and operating losses without tax benefit incurred by our then canadian subsidiary during its closure process 
also included a million increase in valuation allowances related to net operating losses generated in poland and mexico 
in addition  a million tax benefit resulted from reversing income tax reserves associated with certain tax positions taken in prior years 
excluding these items the effective tax rate would have been 
the fluctuations in the effective tax rate are also due to the geographical mix of pre tax earnings and losses  minimum tax requirements in certain local jurisdictions and operating losses for certain operations with no related accrual of tax benefit

table of contents earnings loss from unconsolidated affiliates earnings loss from unconsolidated affiliates were a loss of million in  a loss of million in and earnings of million in includes losses from our castings joint venture and from wlr gbx 
the wlr gbx loss was primarily the result of a mark to market on an interest rate swap  which should no longer have a significant impact on future results 
and consist entirely of results from our castings joint venture 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest includes earnings of million  loss of million and loss of million for the years ended august   and and primarily represents our joint venture partner s share in the earnings losses of our mexican railcar manufacturing joint venture that began production in liquidity and capital resources we have been financed through cash generated from operations  borrowings and stock issuance 
at august  cash and cash equivalents was million  an increase of million from million at the prior year end 
cash provided by operating activities for the years ended august   and was million  million and million 
the decrease in was primarily due to change in working capital needs based on current activity levels 
the change from to was primarily due to lower working capital needs as a result of decreased levels of operation 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended august  was million compared to million in and million in and cash utilization was primarily due to capital expenditures during the year 
cash utilization in was primarily due to acquisitions in the wheel services  refurbishment parts segment and capital expenditures for the year 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million for the years ended august   and of these capital expenditures  approximately million  million and million for the years ended august   and were attributable to leasing services operations 
leasing services capital expenditures for  net of proceeds from sales of equipment  are expected to be approximately million 
we regularly sell assets from our lease fleet  some of which may have been purchased within the current year and included in capital expenditures 
proceeds from the sale of equipment were approximately million  million and million for the years ended august   and approximately million  million and million of capital expenditures for the years ended august   and were attributable to manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for manufacturing are expected to be approximately million in and primarily relate to enhancements to existing manufacturing facilities and erp implementation 
wheel services  refurbishment parts capital expenditures for the years ended august   and were million  million and million and are expected to be approximately million in for the opening of a new wheel services facility to replace one previously destroyed by fire  maintenance and improvement of existing facilities and erp implementation 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended august  compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended august and cash provided by financing activities of million in during  we received million in net proceeds from an equity offering and million in net proceeds from term loan borrowings

the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents all amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated at the august  exchange rate for the following discussion 
as of august  senior secured credit facilities  consisting of two components  aggregated million 
a million revolving line of credit  maturing november  is secured by substantially all of our assets in the united states not otherwise pledged as security for term loans 
the facility is available to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment  principally for the united states and mexican operations 
advances under this revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates that depend on the type of borrowing and the defined ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition  current lines of credit totaling million secured by substantially all of our european assets  with various variable rates  are available for working capital needs of the european manufacturing operation 
european credit facilities are continually being renewed 
currently these european credit facilities have maturities that range from april through june in september  our mexican joint venture renewed its line of credit for up to million secured by certain of the joint venture s accounts receivable and inventory 
advances under this facility bear interest at libor plus and are due days after the date of borrowing 
currently the mexican joint venture can borrow on this facility through august as of august  outstanding borrowings under our facilities consists of million in letters of credit outstanding under the north american credit facility and million in revolving notes outstanding under the european credit facilities 
the revolving and operating lines of credit  along with notes payable  contain covenants with respect to the company and various subsidiaries  the most restrictive of which  among other things  limit the ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees  pay dividends or repurchase stock  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  including joint ventures and non us subsidiaries  including but not limited to loans  advances  equity investments and guarantees  enter into mergers  consolidations or sales of substantially all the company s assets  and enter into new lines of business 
the covenants also require certain maximum ratios of debt to total capitalization and minimum levels of fixed charges interest plus rent coverage 
available borrowings under our credit facilities are generally based on defined levels of inventory  receivables  property  plant and equipment and leased equipment  as well as total debt to consolidated capitalization and interest coverage ratios which  as of august  would allow for maximum additional borrowing of million 
the company has an aggregate of million available to draw down under the committed credit facilities as of august  this amount consists of million available on the north american credit facility and million on the european credit facilities 
we may from time to time seek to repurchase or otherwise retire or exchange securities  including outstanding borrowings and equity securities  and take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our balance sheet 
these actions may include open market repurchases  unsolicited or solicited privately negotiated transactions or other retirements  repurchases or exchanges 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  prevailing market conditions  trading levels of our debt  our liquidity requirements and contractual restrictions  if applicable 
we have operations in mexico and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to hedge a portion of that risk 
no provision has been made for credit loss due to counterparty non performance 
in addition to the third party financing  greenbrier has provided financing for a portion of the working capital needs of our mexican joint venture through a secured  interest bearing loan 
the balance of the loan was million as of august  in accordance with customary business practices in europe  we have million in bank and third party performance and warranty guarantee facilities  all of which have been utilized as of august  to date no amounts have been drawn under these performance and warranty guarantees 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents quarterly dividends were suspended as of the third quarter a quarterly dividend of 
per share was declared during the second quarter of quarterly dividends of 
per share were declared each quarter from the fourth quarter of through the first quarter of we have million in long term advances to an unconsolidated affiliate which are secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
as of august   this same unconsolidated affiliate had million in third party debt for which we have guaranteed or approximately million 
the facility has been idled and expects to restart production when demand returns 
we  along with our partners  have made additional equity investments during fiscal year  our share of which was million 
we made an additional investment of million during the first quarter of additional investments may be required 
we expect existing funds and cash generated from operations  together with proceeds from financing activities including borrowings under existing credit facilities and long term financings  to be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and expected debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
the following table shows our estimated future contractual cash obligations as of august  years ending august  in thousands total thereafter notes payable interest revolving notes purchase commitments operating leases railcar leases other due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at august   we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  approximately million in uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparation of a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different than that taken by us  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations we are responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated maintenance liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of railcar 
these estimates involve judgment as to the future costs of repairs and the types and timing of repairs required over the lease term 
as we cannot predict with certainty the prices  timing and volume of maintenance needed in the future on railcars under long term leases  this estimate is uncertain and could be materially different from maintenance requirements 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
these adjustments could be material due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting future maintenance requirements 
warranty accruals warranty costs to cover a defined warranty period are estimated and charged to operations 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data for existing products and judgment for new products 
if warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations  warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product 
conversely  there is the possibility that claims may be lower than estimates 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
however  as we cannot predict future claims  the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
railcars are generally manufactured  repaired or refurbished under firm orders from third parties 
revenue is recognized when railcars are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
direct finance lease revenue is recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease terms 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they involve judgment as to the estimated use of each railcar 
adjustments to actual have historically not been significant 
revenues from construction of marine barges are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or on the completed contract method based on the terms of the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  judgment is used to determine a definitive threshold against which progress towards completion can be measured to determine timing of revenue recognition 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value is recognized in the current period 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the impairment and could be materially different if circumstances change 
certain long lived assets were tested for impairment during the quarter ended may  forecasted undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the assets indicating that the assets were not impaired 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets the company periodically acquires businesses in purchase transactions in which the allocation of the purchase price may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the amount of future period amortization and possible impairment charges 
we perform a goodwill impairment test annually during the third quarter 
goodwill is also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists 
the provisions of asc  intangibles goodwill and other  require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required only in situations where the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined in the first step 
in the second step we would compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
loss contingencies on certain railcar contracts the total cost to produce the railcar may exceed the actual fixed or determinable contractual sale price of the railcar 
when the anticipated loss on production of railcars in backlog is both probable and estimable the company will accrue a loss contingency 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the accrual and may be adjusted at a later date to reflect actual costs 
new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in mexico  germany and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   million of forecast sales in europe were hedged by foreign exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted and the interaction between currency rates  it is not possible to predict the impact a movement in a single foreign currency exchange rate would have on future operating results 
we believe the exposure to foreign exchange risk is not material 
in addition to exposure to transaction gains or losses  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of our foreign subsidiaries 
at august   net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million and a strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in equity of million  of total equity greenbrier 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
interest rate risk we have managed a portion of our variable rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our revolving debt and a portion of term debt  which are at variable rates 
at august   of our outstanding debt has fixed rates and has variable rates 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
