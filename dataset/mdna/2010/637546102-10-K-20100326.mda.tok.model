results of operations for years ended december  and the company ended with premiums earned totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
premium revenue is generated from our two operating segments p c segment and life segment 
the p c segment accounts for approximately of total premium revenue production while our life segment contributes the remaining 
the p c segment operates in personal lines insurance products primarily generating premium revenue from dwelling fire  allied lines and homeowners policies 
our life segment produces premium revenue primarily from life  accident and critical illness insurance policies 
net investment income totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  we currently hold  in company owned life insurance coli 
the change in value related to this investment lead to investment income totaling  in compared to investment losses of  for the same period last year 
the coli income was the primary reason for the overall increase in investment income 
net realized investment gains totaled  in compared to investment losses of  in the primary reason for the improved results was the significant change in losses recognized from other than temporary impairment write downs 
during  the company recognized losses from other than temporary impairments totaling  compared to  during realized investment gains increased  from fixed maturities compared to while realized gains decreased by  for equity securities compared to other income was  as of december  compared to  for the same period last year  a  decrease 
other income consists primarily of billing  payment and policy fees related to the issuance of our property and automobile insurance policies as well as miscellaneous income 
policyholder benefit expenses decreased  ending at  compared to  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the  decline was the reduction in claim activity in the p c segment 
during  we did not incur any hurricane losses in any of our coverage areas while in we incurred net losses from hurricane gustav and hurricane ike totaling  and  respectively 
furthermore  catastrophe losses from tornado and windstorm activity were less frequent in leaving the p c segment with losses from these events totaling  compared to  in general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the same period last year 
the single most significant factor contributing to the increase in general expenses was an increase in director s non qualified deferred compensation at the holding company level 
the phantom stock plan increased in value with the recovery in our stock price and led to an increase in expenses 
we also incurred increased legal fees in the holding company in interest expense decreased  in compared to the largest portion of interest expense relates to our non insurance operations 
additional information regarding the long term debt generating the interest expense can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company incurred income tax expenses totaling  compared to an income tax benefit of  in the tax benefit from was fully recovered through the utilization of net operating loss carry backs applied to tax years and due to the decrease in storm activity as well as profitable underwriting results  the company ended with net income totaling  compared to a net loss in of  the p c and life segments contributed  and  respectively to net income in  while we incurred a net loss of  from non insurance operations

the change in stockholders equity is composed of dividends paid to shareholders of  and net income of  as well as accumulated other comprehensive income totaling  and unrealized gains on interest rate swap totaling  the increase in accumulated income was primarily the result of increases in the value of our investment portfolio

year end book value per share  defined as stockholders equity divided b y common shares outstanding of  was at december  compared to at december  industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s two operating segments life segment  property and casualty segment and holding company level expenses is summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance the property and casualty segment composed of total premium revenue in compared to in the property and casualty segment is primarily composed of dwelling fire  allied lines and homeowners lines of business 
the life segment composed of premium revenue in compared to in with revenue produced primarily from life insurance products 
the following discussion outlines more specific information with regard to the individual operating segments of the company along with non insurance related information primarily administration expenses associated with the insurance holding company 
life and accident and health insurance operations our life segment is the smaller of our insurance segments contributing of total insurance premium revenue in and in premium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the years ended december  and are summarized below amounts in thousands revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains losses other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense loss income before income taxes income tax expense benefit current deferred net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  nsic premium accounted for of total consolidated premium revenue for as mentioned above  nsic operates using two primary methods of distribution home service employee agents and independent agents 
while the company has used the traditional home service distribution method since its founding in  the independent agent distribution method has become the largest source of renewal business and new business production over the past decade 
for  the home service and independent agent distribution methods accounted for and  respectively of nsic premium revenue 
nsic ended with premium revenue of  compared to  for the same period last year  an increase of 
the increase in premium revenue was primarily due to an increase of in premiums in the independent agent s method of distribution compared to premium revenue in the home service agent method of distribution declined compared to the decline in premium revenue related to the home service agents distribution method was primarily the result of a shift in our primary focus to the independent agent distribution method 
significant products contributing to the increase in premium revenue were our new cancer product launched in the fourth quarter of and renewal premiums from our ordinary life line of business 
minimum standards regarding retention rates have helped to increase our persistency in the independent method of distribution 
net investment income totaled  as of december  compared to  for the same period last year 
investment income in nsic is generated from securities held in our investment portfolio as well as mortgage and policy loan interest 
investment income increased  in compared to primarily due to an overall increase in nsic s invested assets 
nsic ended with net realized investment gains totaling  compared to realized losses of  in the primary reason for the improved results in the current year was the reduced amount recognized for other than temporary impairment losses 
during nsic recognized  in other than temporary impairment losses compared to  for the same period last year 
policyholder benefit expenses decreased  ending at  compared to  for the same period last year 
the reduction in policyholder benefits was primarily attributable to a  reduction in benefit payments under accident and health contracts 
general and administrative expenses and deferred policy acquisition costs dac increased a net  in compared to while deferred policy acquisition costs in the life segment decreased  from  general and administrative expenses increased  from the primary reason for the change in the allocation between general expenses and dac was a downward adjustment in the estimate of expenses capitalized as a component of dac 
the life segment incurred income tax expenses totaling  compared to an income tax benefit of  in income tax expense as a percent of pretax income increased due to an increase in deferred taxes 
the current tax benefit from was fully recovered through the utilization of net operating loss carry backs applied to tax years and nsic ended with year to date net income of  compared to a year to date net loss of  for the same period last year 
the primary factor contributing to the increase in net income was the lack of impairment losses in the investment portfolio 
net realized capital gains totaled  in compared to net realized capital losses  primarily associated with other than temporary impairments  of  in a much improved investment climate was the primary factor contributing to the turnaround in realized capital gains 
property casualty operations property and casualty operations constitute our largest segment composing and of our total premium revenue in and  respectively 
premium revenues and operating income for the p c segment for the years ended december  and are summarized below revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit current deferred net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty segment premium revenue for increased compared to the stabilization of renewal rates  moderate rate increases in our largest states and a reduction in ceded reinsurance due to a lack of catastrophe reinstatement premium payments were the primary factors contributing to the increase 
production of premium revenue in the p c segment is primarily driven by our dwelling fire  allied lines and homeowner lines of business 
the following table provides net premiums earned by line of business net premium earned of npe net premium earned of npe line of business dwelling fire allied lines homeowners ocean marine private passenger automobile commercial automobile improvement in operating results was a primary focus area during we took a critical look at our rating methodology in the dwelling line of business as well as the homeowners programs offered by the p c companies 
we made efforts to improve underwriting margins but continue to face regulatory hurdles to properly compensate for our risk  especially in coastal areas 
in addition to our focus on improving property underwriting results  we expanded our tiered medalist automobile program into louisiana 
the private passenger automobile program  though only of total premium revenue in  experienced a increase in net premiums earned compared to the same period last year 
net premiums earned were down slightly in our dwelling fire program but the homeowners programs e nded with net premium earned up compared to net investment income totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in investment income in the p c segment was primarily attributable to the change in value of the company owned life insurance coli investment 
the p c segment ended with realized capital gains totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
a reduction in the number of securities sold at a gain during compared to was the primary reason for the decline in realized capital gains 
the p c segment was less impacted by the write down of other than temporary impairments in versus during  other than temporary impairment losses totaled  compared to  in for information regarding management s method of determining investment impairment  please see the other than temporary impairment and credit quality section under investments on page other income  which primarily consists of billing  payment and policy fees related to our property and automobile business decreased  from the decline in dwelling fire premium revenue led to a reduction in billing fees which caused the decrease in other income for compared to the same period last year 
the most significant improvement in the p c segment was the significant improvement in our loss ratio 
policyholder benefit payments declined to of premiums earned in  compared to in policyholder benefit expenses decreased to  in from  in  a decline of 
during the company incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses totaling   after reinsurance recoveries from hurricane gustav and   after reinsurance recoveries from hurricane ike 
in addition  in the p c segment experienced unusually high loss frequency from tornado and storm related activity totaling  fortunately  the storm activity affecting the company during was substantially less amounti ng to  in loss and loss adjustment expenses for the current year 
the company experienced no hurricane losses in we routinely evaluate our claims frequency and severity statistics in order to better understand the nature of our risks and aid in the loss reserve liability evaluation process 
claims frequency is a measure of the number of claims incurred during a measurement period regardless of amount 
claims severity is a measure of the average dollar amount of claims during a measurement period 
during  tornado and storm related frequency was significantly below levels we experienced throughout non hurricane catastrophe losses totaled  in compared to  in the severity of claims related to catastrophes affecting the p c companies during totaled approximately per claim 
the severity of claims related to the nineteen non hurrica ne catastrophes affecting the p c companies during totaled approximately  per claim while the average severity of claims related to hurricanes gustav and ike totaled  and  respectively 
the p c segment continued to be involved in litigation pertaining to claims from hurricane katrina which impacted our coverage areas in louisiana and mississippi in august during  the claims associated with hurricane katrina exceeded the  million upper limit of the reinsurance agreement in affect during as of december   cumulative claims related to hurricane katrina exceeded the reinsurance upper limit by  although the reinsurance for this catastrophe has been exhausted and the ultimate outcome of these claims is unknown  the company believes it maintains adequate reserves for the open claims based on information available at the present time 
additional adverse development related to the claims in litigation is possible and therefore these c laims are carefully monitored on a continuous basis 
adverse development related to the remaining open katrina claims increased incurred losses by there was no significant change in deferred policy acquisition costs which totaled  in of premium revenue compared to  in of premium revenue 
deferred policy acquisition cost consists of amortization of previously capitalized distribution costs  primarily commissions 
commission expense for totaled of premium revenue compared to of premium revenue in commission expenses totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease 
implementation of a new profit sharing bonus calculation during was the driver of the reduction in overall commission expenses 
the company increased the threshold to be attained by agents in order to qualify for the bonus and altered the calculation base of the bonus to utilize earned as opposed to written premium 
we did however open the profit sharing bonus to premium generated related to the automobile line of business 
general expenses totaled  or of premium revenue  in compared to  or of premium revenue  in cost saving initiatives related to reductions in postage cost and salary expenses were the primary contributors to the decrease in general expenses 
during we increased the amount of information available to our agents on our website and reduced routine mailings of this information  resulting in a reduction in postage costs 
we also continue to leverage the benefits of new technology investments in order to achieve greater levels of efficiency in our home office operations  thus reducing salary costs 
the combined ratio for was compared to for the same period last year 
improved operating results  less storm activity and the lack of hurricanes impacting our coverage areas were primary factors leading to the decline in compared to the combined ratio for was adversely impacted by losses incurred from hurricanes gustav and ike and a very active spring storm season 
the components of this ratio are broken out in the table below under the section property and casualty combined ratio 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premium revenue 
the results of these ratios for the past two years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
during  the p c segment experienced improved results primarily due to the reduction in tornado and storm related losses as well as the lack of hurricane activity during the year 
the  in losses incurred from non hurricane catastrophes during added percentage points to our combined ratio 
in comparison  tornado and windstorm losses totaling  incurred in the first half of added percentage points to the combined ratio 
losses  net of reinsurance recoveries  from hurricane gustav totaled  and added percentage points to the combined ratio 
losses  net of reinsurance recoveries  from hurricane ike totaled  and added percentage points to the combined ratio 
non insurance operations revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense current deferred net loss the non insurance operations of the company consist of our parent company  the national security group  inc the national security group has no material sources of revenue and relies almost entirely on dividends and fees from subsidiaries to pay expenses 
dividends are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financials included herein 
the expenses of the group consist of expenses associated with the public listing of our stock  taxes and fees  and directors fees 
the most significant expense of the group is interest expense associated with  in debt 
this debt is composed of two trust preferred securities offerings  the first being  issued in the december and the second being  issued in june the primary use for these proceeds was to add capital to the property and casualty subsidiaries 
total interest expense for the group associated with these borrowings in was  compared to  in investments the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of standard and poor s bond portfolio ratings s p or equivalent ratings of total bond portfolio aaa aa aa aa a a a bbb bbb bbb bb b b in default a summary of debt and equity securities available for sale with unrealized losses as of december  along with related fair value  aggregated by length of time that the investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position follows dollars in thousands december  less than months months or longer total gross gross gross total fair unrealized fair unrealized fair unrealized securities in a value losses value losses value losses loss position fixed maturities corporate mortgage backed securities private label mortgage backed securities obligations of state and political subdivisions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies equity securities other than temporary impairments and credit quality at december   just under of total investments in the fixed income portfolio were classified as below investment grade 
when a fixed maturity security has a decline in value where fair value is below amortized cost an other than temporary impairment otti is triggered in circumstances where the company has the intent to sell the security  it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  and or the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the company will be required to sell the security before recovery  an otti is recognized as a realized loss in the income statement equal to the difference between the security s amortized cost and its fair value 
if the company does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery  the otti is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized as a realized loss in the income statement  and the amount related to all other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
when an equity security has a decline in value  where fair value is below cost  that is deemed to be other than temporary  the company reduces the book value of the security to its current fair value  recognizing the decline as a realized loss in the income statement 
any future increases in the market value of investments written down are reflected as changes in unrealized gains as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
management has evaluated each security in a significant unrealized loss position 
for the year ended december    in otti were realized by the company compared to  in of the remaining securities in loss positions  management believes based on current information  that no ultimate loss will be realized on the securities 
most unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio are interest rate and market driven as opposed to credit quality driven 
the company has no material direct exposure to sub prime mortgage loans and less than of the fixed income investment portfolio is rated below investment grade 
with respect to equity securities in a loss position  management evaluated financial information on each company and reviewed analyst reports from a t least two independent sources 
based on a review of the available financial information  the prospect for future earnings of each company and consideration of the company s intent and ability to hold the securities until market values recovered  it was determined that the remaining securities in an accumulated loss position in the portfolio were temporary impairments 
the amortized cost and aggregate fair value of debt securities at december   by contractual maturity  are as follows 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

we own no commercial mortgage backed securities 
we also have no material direct exposure in sub prime mortgage loans in our private label rmbs portfolio 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than were expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in th e overall securitization structure 
in order to minimize risk associated with prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations  the company typically invests primarily in more predictable planned amortization class pac structures of cmo s and typically avoids investment in cmo s priced at significant premiums above par value 
as for the composition of the rmbs portfolio  agency mortgage backed securities compose and of the rmbs portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the remainder of the rmbs portfolio is composed of private label mortgage backed securities 
these securities consist primarily of conventional and year loans with an average borrower fico score of we own no mortgage backed securities with direct exposure to subprime loans and less than of the rmbs portfolio is composed of loans subject to rate resets 
three securities in the private label mortgage backed security portfolio is rated below investment grade and it composes less than of total invested assets 
investment portfolio income investment returns with respect to the investment portfolio for the years ended december  and follows year ended december  net investment income average current yield on investments total return on investments net realized losses gains on investments before taxes change in accumulated net unrealized gains before income taxes the increase in the average current yield on investments in compared to was primarily due to opportunities created in early due to a significant increase in spreads and yields on corporate debt 
we increased our allocation to corporate debt in early  thus taking advantage of the improved yields in the market 
the total return on investments consists of return of current interest and dividend payments current yield components plus realized and unrealized appreciation or depreciation in asset market values 
due to improvement in overall market stability in  we experienced a significant improvement in investment market values 
this improvement in market values of long term holdings  along with increased allocation of new investments in corporate debt securities during the depressed market in early  led to an total return on our investment portfolio in the total return in was a significant turnaround from the negative total return experienced in significant reductions in market values of portfolio holdings due to a meltdown in credit markets were the primary driver of the negative total return experienced in the most significant change in investment income in compared to was a decline in realized capital losses and an increase in net unrealized capital gains 
the most significant component contributing to the realized capital losses in were other than temporary impairment charges totaling  details of the individual issuers composing the other than temporary impairment charges in and are as follows other than temporary impairments issuer otti loss general motors cit bond cit stock harborview masco lehman brothers washington mutual harborview mortgage american general fhlmc pfd fnma pfd repurchase agreements the company maintains a repurchase agreement under which the policy requires minimum of the fair value of the securities purchased to be maintained as collateral 
cash collateral received is invested in short term investments 
the repurchase investments are limited to government securities that are highly liquid 
the company does not have any reverse repurchase agreements 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration  and therefore  a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investments  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
as of december   the maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the company  stated at amortized cost  was as follows amounts in thousands maturity available for sale held to maturity total percentage of total maturity in less than year maturity in years maturity in years maturity after years it should be noted that the above table represents maturities based on stated maturity 
due to call and prepayment features inherent in some debt securities  actual repayment will differ from stated maturities 
the company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicates that cash flow provided from operating activities was  in compared to net uses from operating activities of  in an improvement in underwriting results in our property and casualty insurance operations in was the primary source of operating cash flow in in  the adverse impact of hurricanes gustav and ike was the primary contributor to increased uses of cash in operating activities 
in a typical year  cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities tend to have an inverse relationship 
cash flows from and are examples of this inverse relationship 
in  improved underwriting results in the property and casualty subsidiaries increased cash from operations 
this increased cash from operations was then used to increase investments leading to a net increase in cash used in investing activities 
results for show a similar relationship between cash from operations and investments but in the opposite direction 
increased uses of cash in operating activities in  primarily the payment of hurricane claims  led us to liquidate certain investments in order to provide more cash to pay claims 
therefore  cash pro vided from investments of  was primarily used to support negative cash flow from operations of the consolidated statement of cash flows also reflects a decrease in cash used in financing activities of  and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities in reflect the revision in the company s dividend policy in which quarterly dividends were reduced from cents per share  per quarter to cents per share  per quarter 
a short term loan was also repaid in the following table reflects the anticipated cash flows associated with our short and long term contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obiligations interest on debt obligations property and casualty claim reserves future life insurance obligations to be calculated long term debt  consisting of two separate issues of trust preferred securities  is assumed to be settled at contractual maturity 
interest on long term debt is calculated using the interest rates in effect at december  for each issue 
interest on long term debt is accrued and settled quarterly 
therefore  the timing and amount of interest payments may vary from the calculated value included in the table above 
these calculations do not take into account any potential prepayments 
for additional information regarding long term debt and interest on long term debt  please see note  notes payable and long term debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated payout of property and casualty claim reserves  which includes loss and loss adjustment expenses  are based upon historical payout patterns 
both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payment indicated 
future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments and surrender benefits on policies inforce at december  these estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
in contrast to this table  the majority of nsic s obligations is recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth  interest crediting or future deposits 
therefore  the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
management believes that current assets  future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations 
included in long term debt held by the company is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed on december  the proceeds from the debentures were used to make a  capital infusion in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty with the remainder to be held for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures mature december  it is anticipated that principal payments will not be made until the expiration of the fixed rate period on the debt in also included in long term debt is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed june  the proceeds from the debentures were used to fund general corporate expenses thereby reducing the amount of dividends to the group paid by the p c subsidiary natio nal security fire casualty thereby continuing to restore capital in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty to pre hurricane levels 
the second issue matures june  and may be redeemed following the fifth anniversary of issuance 
in estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves  the company utilized historical payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above 
however  management believes that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due 
also  due to the relatively short tail nature of the majority of the company s claim liabilities  management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and  in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
improved capital positions and operating results have increased the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company 
an operating line of credit was obtained by the holding company in december of to allow flexibility with respect to cash management at the holding company level 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company  s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows regulatory event ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc less than or equal to company action lever regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of to at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company exceeds the minimum rbc requirements

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies may be based on including but not limited to gaap authoritative literature  statutory authoritative literature  regulations and industry standards 
the company s financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies 
it is management s opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance deferred policy acquisition costs income taxes fair values of financial instruments claim liabilities recognition of revenue contingencies recently issued accounting standards reinsurance risk management involves ceding risks to reinsurers for policies underwritten based on contractual agreements 
the reinsurance purchased helps provide protection by individual loss or catastrophic event when claims exceed specified amounts 
although the reinsurance protects our company in the event a loss penetrates into a particular reinsurance agreement  ultimate responsibility for claim settlement rests with our company if any reinsurer defaults on payments due 
we record an asset for reinsurance recoverable on the financials for amounts due from reinsurers and monitor the balances due by reinsurer to ensure the asset is ultimately going to be collectible 
if we discover an amount due may not be received we remove the balance and charge it to an allowance for doubtful accounts or charge it off to expense based on the information available at the time 
when a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured  we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant 
subsequently  we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of applicable reinsurance treaties 
reinsurance is maintained by the life and accident and health segment for losses that exceed  for any one insured 
nsfc and omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of  on any single policy 
in addition  the property and casualty segment holds a catastrophe contract which covers losses related to a catastrophic event with multiple policyholders affected 
in the event a catastrophe exceeds the million retention stated in the contract  reinsurers will reimburse the company co pay of gross losses and loss adjustment expenses paid up to million layer one and layer two of the contract 
if losses exceed million  the contract allows for reimbursement of losses and loss adjustment expenses up to million 
any losses above the million upper limit are the responsibility of our company 
the contract in place during also allowed one reinstatement for coverage under the contract for a second catastrophic event if needed 
the contract provided protection up to at least a year near term event as depicted in catastrophe modeling results 
the near term catastrophe modeling results reflect a predicted increase in storm activity given the current weather pattern and various factors projected to impact our weather patterns in the near term 
at december   the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount 
the reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty 
areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed 
there is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded 
this possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties  such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable 
management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectibility 
for more information regarding reinsurance  please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
dac is primarily comprised of commissions  premium taxes  and underwriting costs associated with issuing new policies 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are not expensed in their entirety at policy inception  rather they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies 
a reduction in dac is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income 
management reviews dac calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability 
changes in management s assumptions  estimates or judgment with respect to calculating dac could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
changes in loss ratios  projected investment income  premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of dac 
at december  and  the company recorded  and  respectively  as an asset for dac in the financial statements 
we do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs 
for more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs  please see note to our financial statements 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or are settled 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the new rate is enacted 
at december   there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable 
for more information regarding deferred income taxes  please see note to our financial statements 
the company evaluates all tax positions taken on its us federal income tax return 
no material uncertainties exist for any tax positions taken by the company fair values of financial instruments investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available 
quoted prices are available for most investment debt and equity securities included in the financial statements 
further discussion of fair value methodology is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
periodically  the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value  volatility  credit quality and existing market conditions 
management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
evaluation criteria include credit quality of security  severity of decrease between cost and market value  length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future 
this evalu ation requires significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement 
we have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments such as collateralized debt obligations 
claim liabilities property and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims 
loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry 
reserves are management s expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost 
management estimated reserves are based on historical settlement patterns  estimated salvage and subrogation  and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances 
management s reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness 
the reserve analysis performed by management is reviewed by the actuaries during the third quarter e ach year with a final comprehensive review and actuarial sign off performed at year end 
at december  and  the recorded liability for loss and loss and adjustment expense was  and  respectively 
the decline in reserves is directly attributable to the absence of hurricanes during we believe the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices 
for more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense  see note to our financial statements 
recognition of revenue life insurance premiums are recognized as revenues when due 
property and casualty insurance premiums include direct writings plus reinsurance assumed less reinsurance ceded and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies 
unearned premiums represent that portion of direct premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force and is reported as a liability 
prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and is reported as an asset 
contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from  but not limited to  litigation  claims  assessments  fines and penalties are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
additional details with respect to contingencies are disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in april  a new accounting standard was issued which amends the recognition guidance for other than temporary impairments otti of debt securities and expands the financial statement disclosures for otti on debt and equity securities 
this new accounting standard states that an otti write down of debt securities  where fair value is below amortized cost  is triggered in circumstances where an entity has the intent to sell a security  it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
if an entity intends to sell a security or if it is more likely than not the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery  an otti write down is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the security s amortized cost and its fair value 
if an entity does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before rec overy  the otti write down is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and the amount related to all other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
this new accounting standard requires that companies record  as of the beginning of the interim period of adoption  a cumulative effect adjustment to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized otti loss from retained earnings to other comprehensive income if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
the adoption had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the company had no cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption at the beginning of the second quarter 
in april  a new accounting standard was issued related to determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
our adoption of this new accounting standard was effective april  the new accounting standard reaffirms that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the new accounting standard also reaffirms the need to use judgment in determining if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market has become inactive 
the implementation of the new guidance did not have a significant impac t on our financial statements 
in april  a new accounting standard was issued related to interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the new accounting standard requires disclosing qualitative and quantitative information about the fair value of all financial instruments on a quarterly basis  including methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value during the period 
these disclosures were previously only done annually 
the disclosures required by the new accounting standard were effective for the quarter ending june  the implementation of the new guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  a new accounting standard was issued related to the accounting for transfers of financial assets  which updates accounting for securitizations and special purpose entities 
the new accounting standard is a revision of previously issued accounting standards related to accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and will require additional information regarding financial asset transfers  including securitization transactions  and the presence of continuing exposure around the risks related to transferred financial assets 
in addition  the new accounting standard removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and changes the requirements for de recognizing financial assets 
the new accounting standard was effective january  we do not expect the imple mentation of this new accounting standard to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  new consolidation guidance was issued which replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an approach that is primarily qualitative  requires ongoing assessments whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  and requires additional disclosure about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 
effective july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the accounting standards codification asc  which combined and superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards under gaap and became the single official source for authoritative gaap guidance combined with guidance issued by the us securities and exchange commission sec 
the fasb no longer issues new standards in the previous formats 
instead  amendments to the codification are made by issuing accounting standards updates asu 
the codification did not change existing gaap 
accordingly  the issuance of the codification did not impact the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in august  the fasb issued asu measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
asu updated asc section fair value measurements to provide additional guidance on how to measure liabilities at fair value for which a quoted price in an active market is not available 
in this situation a company can either use the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset or the quoted price of similar liabilities when traded as assets 
as of december   the only liability measured at fair value was an interest rate swap discussed in note the new guidance was effective for the company on october  the implementation of the new guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under smaller reporting company rules we are not required to disclose information required under item a 
however  in order to provide information to our investors  we have elected to provide information related to market risk 
the company s primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk 
since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities and changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
our portfolio has historically been highly correlated to the s p with regard to market risk 
based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the s p  if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately  certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note and in the consolidated financial statements present additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and are incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of losing principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on capital for a sustained period of time  and low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market 
as for shifts in investment allocations  the company has moderately increased allocations to corporate and tax free bonds 
the improved yield spreads on corporate bonds has made this segment more attractive and the risk of investing in corporate bonds versus government bonds is more appropriately priced in our opinion 
we have also increased our allocation to tax free securities to further enhance after tax returns given our improved earnings performance over the last two years
