item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and executive summary our operations can be broadly classified into two principal segments forward air and fasi 
through our forward air segment  we are a leading provider of time definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the north american deferred air freight market 
we offer our customers local pick up and delivery forward air complete and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective  reliable alternative to air transportation 
we transport cargo that must be delivered at a specific time  but is less time sensitive than traditional air freight 
this type of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as deferred air freight 
we operate our forward air segment through a network of terminals located on or near airports in cities in the united states and canada  including a central sorting facility in columbus  ohio and regional hubs serving key markets 
we also offer our customers an array of logistics and other services including tlx  dedicated fleets  warehousing  customs brokerage  and shipment consolidation  deconsolidation and handling 
fasi provides pool distribution services throughout the mid atlantic  southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
pool distribution involves managing high frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions 
our primary customers for this product are regional and nationwide distributors and retailers  such as mall  strip mall and outlet based retail chains 
we service these customers through a network of terminals and service centers located in cities 
our operations  particularly our network of hubs and terminals  represent substantial fixed costs 
consequently  our ability to increase our earnings depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount of freight and the revenue per pound or carton for the freight shipped through our networks and to grow other lines of businesses  such as tlx  which will allow us to maintain revenue growth in challenging shipping environments 
trends and developments acquisitions on september   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of service express 
service express was a privately held provider of pool distribution services primarily in the mid atlantic and southeastern continental united states 
service express generated approximately million in revenue during the year ended december  the acquisition of service express pool distribution services added to the geographic footprint of the fasi segment in the mid atlantic and southeastern united states 
on march   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of pinch 
pinch was a privately held provider of pool distribution  airport to airport  truckload  customs  and cartage services primarily to the southwestern continental united states 
pinch generated approximately million in revenue during the year ended december  the acquisition of pinch s pool distribution services expanded the geographic footprint of the fasi segment in the southwestern united states 
in addition  it provided additional tonnage density to the forward air airport to airport network  and the acquisition of pinch s cartage and truckload business provided an opportunity for forward air to expand its service options in the southwestern united states 
further  on december  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of black hawk for approximately million to increase the penetration of our airport to airport network in the midwest continental united states 
also  on july   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of usac for approximately million 
through this acquisition we began providing pool distribution services throughout the southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
results from operations during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   we experienced significant year over year decreases in our consolidated revenues and results from operations 
we largely attribute the decline in forward air revenue and income from operations to the economic recession experienced throughout and its effects on our overall business volumes and the rates we are able to charge for our core services 
fasi revenue continued to increase substantially year over year primarily as a result of our acquisitions of pinch and service express and new business wins 
however  revenues have not reached expected levels and losses have been higher than expected largely due to the economic recession reducing business volumes 
despite significant new business wins  fasi revenue growth will slow in as we have now reached the anniversary dates of our acquisitions 
declining fuel prices also adversely affected our revenues and results of operations during as compared with our net fuel surcharge revenue is the result of our fuel surcharge rates  which are set weekly using the national average for diesel price per gallon  and the tonnage transiting our network 
the decline in tonnage levels combined with the continuing decline in diesel fuel prices have resulted in a significant reduction in our net fuel surcharge revenue and results from operations during as compared to total net fuel surcharge revenue decreased during the year ended december   as compared to however  fuel prices and our related fuel surcharge rates reached comparable year over year levels during the fourth quarter of in february  we notified one of fasi s largest customers that we would cease providing services beginning in the second quarter of during revenues from this customer were approximately million and accounted for of fasi s operating revenue and of our consolidated operating revenue 
while going forward the loss of this customer will reduce fasi s operating revenue we do not anticipate fasi s results of operations will be adversely impacted due to the historically low yields obtained from this business 
goodwill during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test as of march  in accordance with our accounting policy 
we calculated the fair value of the fasi segment using a combination of discounted cash flows and current market valuations for comparable companies 
based on the results of the interim impairment test  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
consequently  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during the first quarter of in accordance with our accounting policy  we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill for each reportable segment as of june  and no additional impairment charges were required 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill related to our forward air and fasi segments was million and million  respectively 
earnings estimated to be generated related to our forward air segment are expected to support the carrying value of its goodwill 
our fasi segment is currently facing the challenges of building and expanding a business during difficult economic times 
if these overall economic conditions worsen or continue for an extended period of time  we may be required to record an additional impairment charge against the carrying value of goodwill related to our fasi segment 
segments our operations can be broadly classified into two principal segments forward air and fasi 
our forward air segment includes our airport to airport network  forward air complete  and tlx services as well as our other accessorial related services such as warehousing  customs brokerage  and value added handling services 
our fasi segment includes our pool distribution business

our airport to airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound  excluding the impact of fuel surcharges and complete  decreased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  tonnage that transited our network decreased by during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the decrease in tonnage was primarily driven by the impact of the economic recession and the resulting reduction in shipping activity 
average base revenue per pound decreased due to the continued shift in revenue mix to shorter distance and lower price per pound routes as well as increased pricing competition brought on by s difficult economic environment 
the remaining decrease in airport to airport revenue is the result of reduced net fuel surcharge revenue offset by increased revenue from our complete pick up and delivery service 
net fuel surcharge revenue decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of reduced average fuel prices as well as decreased overall business volumes 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in complete revenue during the year ended december  compared to the increase in complete revenue is attributable to an increased frequency of airport to airport shippers opting to utilize our complete service 
logistics revenue  which is primarily tlx and priced on a per mile basis  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  tlx revenue decreased million and year over year as tlx average revenue per mile decreased approximately in compared to while miles driven to support our tlx revenue remained consistent from to the decrease in average revenue per mile is mainly attributable to decreased fuel surcharges as a result of decreased fuel prices and reduced yields as a result of increased truckload price competition 
the remaining decrease in logistics revenue was primarily driven by a million  or  decrease in dedicated fleet services  and a million decrease in other non mileage based logistic revenues 
the decline in dedicated fleet services was attributable to loss of the primary customer 
the decrease in non mileage based services was in conjunction with the overall decline in tlx business volumes 
other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling  accounts for the final component of forward air operating revenue 
other revenue decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decline in other revenue was primarily due to volume decreases in conjunction with the decline in our airport to airport business 
these declines were partially offset by increases in dedicated pick up and delivery services initiated during the fourth quarter of fasi fasi operating revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is the result of additional activity from the pinch acquisition on march  and the service express acquisition on september  and new business wins which occurred throughout these increases were slightly offset by reduced fuel surcharge revenues as a result of declining fuel prices and reduced shipping volumes at pre acquisition terminals resulting from the economic recession experienced throughout intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi 
fasi also provided cartage and station agent services to forward air 
the decrease in intercompany eliminations was the result of reduced forward air truckload services provided to fasi 
purchased transportation purchased transportation decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  purchased transportation was during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december forward air forward air s purchased transportation decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in purchased transportation is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately in miles driven offset by a increase in the total cost per mile for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  as a percentage of segment operating revenue  forward air purchased transportation was during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december purchased transportation costs for our airport to airport network decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   purchased transportation for our airport to airport network increased to of airport to airport revenue from for the year ended december  the million decrease is attributable to a decrease in miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers offset by a increase in cost per mile paid to our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers 
the reduction in miles decreased purchased transportation by million while the increase in cost per mile increased purchased transportation million 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers decreased in conjunction with the tonnage decline discussed above 
offsetting these decreases in airport to airport purchased transportation was a million increase in expenses for third party transportation costs associated with the increased customer utilization of complete 
purchased transportation costs for our logistics revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for the year ended december  the decrease in logistics purchased transportation was attributable to the million  or  decrease in tlx purchased transportation 
miles driven to support our tlx revenue remained consistent  decreasing less than  but we reduced the cost per mile by approximately during compared to the reduction in cost per mile was mostly attributable to the increased utilization of our less costly network of owner operators and improved purchasing power given the increased availability of third party transportation providers 
the remaining decrease in logistics purchased transportation was driven by a million decrease in transportation costs associated with dedicated fleet services 
logistics purchased transportation increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the decline in yield per mile resulting from lower fuel surcharges and increased truckload pricing competition 
during  these decreases reduced our tlx yield per mile at a faster rate than we can reduce the related cost per mile 
purchased transportation costs related to our other revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue decreased to of other revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvement in other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue is attributable to the use of company employed drivers to provide the transportation services associated with certain dedicated pick up and delivery services initiated during the fourth quarter of further  due to the economic recession  we have ceased providing other ancillary services in circumstances in which the overall yield was insufficient 
fasi fasi purchased transportation increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fasi purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation is mainly due to our continued expansion of the fasi business through the acquisitions of pinch and service express in march and september  respectively 
the increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue is attributable to increased utilization of owner operators and third party transportation providers as opposed to company employed drivers  thereby shifting the cost from salaries  wages and benefits to purchased transportation 
it is generally more cost effective to run an owner operator than a company employed driver  and we continue to recruit owner operators to use in our fasi operations 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year end december  fasi also provided cartage and agent station services to forward air 
the decrease in intercompany eliminations was the result of reduced forward air truckload services provided to fasi 
salaries  wages  and benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  salaries  wages and employee benefits was during compared to in forward air salaries  wages and employee benefits of forward air decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salaries  wages and employee benefits were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million decrease in salaries  wages  and benefits was driven by our efforts to reduce personnel costs in conjunction with the overall decline in forward air revenue 
our efforts to reduce personnel costs focused largely on controlling airport to airport variable wages  such as dock personnel 
through these reductions we have reduced terminal related pay by approximately million  or 
in addition  we reduced personnel costs associated with our sales force and various back office functions by approximately million  or 
however  these decreases were partially offset by increases in workers compensation claims  share based compensation and employee incentives 
workers compensation claims increased million  or  largely driven by adjustments to our loss development reserves based on actuary analyses of forward air s worker compensation claims experience 
share based compensation increased million  or  due to the annual grants of stock options and non vested shares of common stock non vested shares to key members of management and non employee directors from to the present 
employee incentives increased million  or  for annual incentives for key employees and senior management 
during the fourth quarter of  salaries  wages and employee benefits increased by million as we increased incentive accruals for senior management and key employees 
comparatively  during the fourth quarter of  we decreased salaries  wages and employee benefits by million for incentives to key employees and senior management 
during  we were not able to reduce the fixed components of our salaries and benefits  such as management pay  share based compensation  and other related benefit costs at the same rate at which forward air revenue declined  and as a result salaries  wages  and benefits increased as a percentage of revenue 
fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits of fasi increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of fasi operating revenue  salaries  wages and benefits increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits are higher as a percentage of operating revenue than our forward air segment  as a larger percentage of the transportation services are performed by company employed drivers 
the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is attributable to increases in health insurance and workers compensation costs  which increased to of revenue during from in the increases in health insurance and workers compensation costs is the result of including a full year of claims associated with employees brought on with the pinch and service express acquisitions 
in addition  shared based compensation and employee incentives increased million  or increased as a percentage of revenue  largely driven by increased stock option awards to key fasi employees during operating leases operating leases increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air operating leases increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in operating leases in total dollars was attributable to a million  or  increase in facility rent expense associated with the assumption of additional facilities as a result of the pinch acquisition and the expansion of certain facilities 
the increase in facility rent was offset by a million  or  decrease in tractor leases 
the decrease in tractor leases was the result of a reduction in leased vehicles assumed in conjunction with the pinch acquisition as such leases expired 
fasi operating leases increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of fasi operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was attributable to higher facility rent expense due to the increased number of terminals resulting from the pinch and service express acquisitions 
operating leases also increased million for trailer  tractor  and straight truck leases assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions of pinch and service express 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to increased depreciation on our new regional hub facility  recent trailer purchases  terminal and facility leasehold improvements  and software and computer equipment 
trailer depreciation increased million due to new trailers placed in service during the fourth quarter of other depreciation increased million as a result of depreciation on our new regional hub in dallas fort worth  capital expenditures for improvements to other new or expanded facilities and for capital expenditures required to assimilate equipment  terminals and office facilities obtained through our recent acquisitions into our network 
fasi depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of fasi operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  depreciation on tractors and trailers obtained in conjunction with our acquisitions of pinch and service express accounted for million of the increase in depreciation and amortization 
amortization of intangible assets also increased million due to intangible assets acquired with the pinch and service express acquisitions 
the remaining million increase was attributable to amortization of fastracs  our internally developed software utilized in fasi s operation  depreciation on terminal improvements such as conveyors  security systems and office improvements and depreciation on non rolling stock assets acquired with the pinch and service express acquisitions 
insurance and claims insurance and claims expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims was of consolidated operating revenue during compared with in forward air forward air insurance and claims expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims as a percentage of forward air s operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase is the result of increases in our loss development reserves and the fees associated with investigation and defense of our vehicle liability 
adjustments to our loss development reserves for vehicle accidents increased by approximately million during the year ended december  compared to year ended december  these increases were based on actuarial analyses of forward air s vehicle accident claim experience performed during additionally  professional fees associated with investigation and defense of our vehicle liability increased million during compared to these increases were offset by a million and a million decrease in vehicle accident damages and cargo claims  respectively 
these decreases were the result of the reduced shipping activity discussed above 
fasi fasi insurance and claims increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase in insurance and claims is primarily attributable to a million increase in cargo claims and a million increase in insurance premiums and vehicle claims for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in both is primarily attributable to the increased shipping activity and claims experience associated with our recent acquisitions 
fuel expense fuel expense decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air forward air fuel expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the significant reduction in average fuel prices and the year over year decline in business volumes discussed above 
fasi fasi fuel expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fuel expenses were of fasi operating revenue during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi fuel expense is significantly higher as a percentage of operating revenue than forward air s fuel expense  as fasi utilizes a higher ratio of company employed drivers and company owned or leased vehicles in its operations than forward air 
the decrease in fuel expense was primarily due to the significant reduction in average fuel prices during as compared to offset by increased activity as a result of the pinch and service express acquisitions 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air forward air other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  forward air other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue is the result of expenses not decreasing at the same rate as revenue 
volume related expenses such as tires  dock supplies  maintenance and agent station fees decreased million  or  in compared to however  these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in property and other taxes largely associated with our company owned terminals 
the million increase in property and other taxes is partially attributable to other operating expenses for including a million reduction related to the reversal of previous accruals for fines and penalties associated with the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority 
the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority during the third quarter of for less than the amount previously reserved 
fasi fasi other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  fasi other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to increased volume related expenses  such as dock supplies  tires  and vehicle maintenance 
the increase in the volume related expenses was directly related to the increased revenue activity associated with the acquisitions of pinch and service express 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the increase in revenue outpacing the increase in other operating expenses 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations were million during the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are for agent station services fasi provided to forward air during the year ended december  fasi did not provide agent station services to forward air during impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was million during the year ended december  impairment of goodwill was of consolidated operating revenue for year ended december  forward air impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was million  or  of forward air operating revenue  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   forward air recorded a million charge to write off the net book value of certain truckload and cargo handling customer relationships that had been discontinued during fasi during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was made based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test as of march  based on the results of the impairment test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during income from operations income from operations decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  income from operations was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air income from operations decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  forward air s income from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in income from operations was primarily the result of the decreased transportation and net fuel surcharge revenues discussed above and our inability during to reduce expenses at the same pace as the decline in total revenues 
fasi fasi loss from operations increased approximately million to a million loss from operations for the year ended december  from a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  fasi loss from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in fasi s loss from operations was primarily driven by the million non cash  goodwill impairment charge 
also driving the increase in the operating loss was the lower than projected business volumes 
interest expense interest expense decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was the result of the decline in the average interest rate on net borrowings of our senior credit facility 
other income  net other  net was income of million for the year ended december  compared with income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income was attributable to decreased average cash and investment balances as well as lower returns received on cash invested driven by the decline in short term interest rates 
provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the decline in our income before income taxes combined with an increase in share based compensation on incentive stock options 
the share based compensation for incentive stock options is mostly not deductible for income tax reporting 
also  increasing the effective tax rate was the establishment of a million valuation allowance on fasi s net state deferred tax assets and a million reserve for a state income tax contingency 
the effective rate for the year ended december  was reduced by a million decrease in state income tax expense  net of federal benefit  for the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority 
the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority during the third quarter of for less than the amount previously reserved

revenue for forward air complete  our pick up and delivery service for the airport to airport network increased million in over due to increased customer utilization of the service 
also  net fuel surcharge revenue increased million in over primarily driven by the increase in tonnage and fuel prices during the second and third quarters of these increases were slightly offset by a million decrease in our base airport to airport revenue 
the increase in tonnage that transited our network was offset by a decrease in average revenue per pound before fuel surcharge and forward air complete revenues 
the increase in tonnage was primarily driven by the increased activity resulting from our acquisitions of pinch and black hawk in march and december  respectively  offset by the impact of the economic recession on our airport to airport network during the second half of  but most acutely in the fourth quarter of average revenue per pound before net fuel surcharge and forward air complete revenues decreased due to a shift in our business mix to shorter distance lower price per pound routes 
this shift was primarily the result of new business obtained with the pinch and black hawk acquisitions as well as increased business from international and domestic airlines 
logistics revenue  which is primarily truckload brokerage tlx and priced on a per mile basis  increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in logistics revenue is the result of our continuing efforts as part of our completing the model strategic initiative to grow tlx and million in new revenue from service lines obtained through the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
we continue to place emphasis on capturing a larger percentage of truckload opportunities and correspondingly increasing our access to sufficient truckload capacity through the expansion of our owner operator fleet and the use of third party transportation providers 
through these efforts  we increased the number of miles driven to support our tlx revenue by during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average revenue per mile of our tlx product  including the impact of fuel surcharges  increased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  the increase in revenue per mile is mainly attributable to increased fuel surcharges to offset increased fuel costs 
other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling  accounts for the final component of forward air operating revenue 
other revenue increased million to million for the year ended december   a increase from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased cartage  handling and storage revenue due to new services offered through our recently expanded facilities 
the increased cartage revenue is also the result of new business obtained in conjunction with the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
fasi fasi operating revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is the result of additional activity from the pinch acquisition on march  and the service express acquisition on september  in addition  the year ended december  includes a full twelve months of revenue compared to only five months for the year ended december   as fasi began operations on july  in conjunction with the acquisition of usac 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations of million were the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year ended december  fasi also provides cartage services to forward air 
purchased transportation purchased transportation increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  purchased transportation was during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  forward air forward air s purchased transportation increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in miles driven in addition to a increase in the total cost per mile for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  as a percentage of segment operating revenue  forward air purchased transportation was during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  purchased transportation costs for our airport to airport network increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   purchased transportation for our airport to airport network decreased to of airport to airport revenue from for the year ended december  the million increase was attributable to a increase in miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers plus a increase in cost per mile 
the change in miles increased purchased transportation by million while the change in cost per mile increased purchased transportation million 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers increased to support the increased revenue activity  mainly in the first half of as discussed above 
the increase in cost per mile was attributable to increased customer utilization of forward air complete mitigated by increased utilization of our network of owner operators as opposed to more costly third party transportation providers 
additionally  the increase in cost per mile was also offset by the increased use of company employed drivers 
the increase in the number of company employed drivers and their use in the airport to airport network is mainly a result of the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
the cost for the company employed drivers is included in salaries  wages and benefits instead of purchased transportation 
purchased transportation costs for our logistics revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for the year ended december  the increase is partially attributable to a million increase in costs associated with new logistics business obtained through the acquisition of pinch and black hawk 
the remaining increase is attributable to a increase in miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers plus a increase in the related cost per mile 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers increased to support our continuing efforts to grow our tlx business as discussed above  and accounted for million of the increase in logistics purchased transportation 
the change in the cost per mile increased the logistics purchased transportation by million 
the increase in cost per mile was mostly the result of increased rates from third party transportation providers mostly offset by increased use of our network of owner operators 
the decrease in logistics purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was the result of the favorable change in business mix as well as the addition of the new services from the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
purchased transportation costs related to our other revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue decreased to of other revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvement in other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue was attributable to the use of company employed drivers to provide the transportation services associated with new business obtained from the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
fasi fasi purchased transportation increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fasi purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation was mainly due to our continued expansion of the fasi business through the acquisitions of pinch and service express in march and september  respectively 
in addition  the year ended includes a full twelve months of fasi activity compared to only five months for the year ended december   as fasi began operations on july  purchased transportation had increased as a percentage of fasi revenue mainly due to the increased use of owner operators particularly in conjunction with the acquisition of pinch 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations increased to million and were the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year ended december  during the year ended december   fasi also provided cartage services to forward air 
salaries  wages  and benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits increased by million  or  to million in the year ended from million in the same period of as a percentage of total operating revenue  salaries  wages and employee benefits was during the year ended december  compared to for the same period in forward air salaries  wages and employee benefits of forward air increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salaries  wages and employee benefits were of forward air s operating revenue in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue was the result of increases in health insurance costs and share based compensation offset by decreases in workers compensation and employee incentive costs 
employee incentives decreased million  or  as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was due to a reduction of annual incentives for key employees due to failures to achieve performance goals 
during the fourth quarter of  salaries  wages and employee benefits were reduced by million as we reduced accruals for incentives to key employees and senior management 
comparatively  we increased salaries  wages and employee benefits by million during the fourth quarter of for annual incentives to key employees and senior management 
workers compensation costs decreased approximately million  or  as a percentage of forward air s operating revenue 
the year over year difference was primarily due to a million increase in our workers compensation loss reserves recorded in that resulted from an actuarial analysis 
the remaining decrease was due to reductions in our workers compensation loss reserves as a result of lower claims experience than projected in previous periods 
share based compensation increased million  or as a percentage of forward air s operating revenue  due to the annual grants of stock options and non vested shares to key members of management and non employee directors from to the present 
health insurance costs increased million and as a percentage of forward air s operating revenue 
the increase was driven by an increase in plan participants primarily as a result of our pinch and black hawk acquisitions in march and december  respectively 
the remaining increase in total dollars was attributable to the increased headcount of mainly terminal and company employed drivers associated with our acquisitions of pinch and black hawk 
fasi fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was mainly attributable to the year ended including twelve months of expense while included only five months  as fasi was not operating until july  as a percentage of fasi operating revenue  salaries  wages and benefits increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits were higher as a percentage of operating revenue than our forward air segment  as a larger percentage of the transportation services were performed by company employed drivers as opposed to independent owner operators 
the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue was attributable to the acquisition of service express in september the terminals we acquired with the service express acquisition utilize a much higher percentage of contract labor for its dock personnel than used by preexisting fasi terminals 
contract labor was more expensive in the short term than company employed cargo handlers and dock personnel 
we will evaluate the proper utilization of contract labor in these terminals during the first quarter of operating leases operating leases increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air operating leases increased million and to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of forward air operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in operating leases in total dollars was attributable to million in higher facility rent expense associated with the assumption of additional facilities as a result of the pinch and black hawk acquisitions and the expansion of certain facilities 
operating leases also increased million for trailer and tractor leases assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions of pinch and black hawk 
fasi fasi operating lease expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was attributable to higher facility rent expense due to the increased number of terminals resulting from the pinch and service express acquisitions 
operating leases also increased million for trailer  tractor  and straight truck leases assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions of pinch and service express 
the increase in operating lease expense  both for facilities and equipment  is also attributable to the year ended including twelve months of lease expense while included only five months  as fasi was not operating until july  the increase in lease expense for tractors  straight trucks and trailers was the primary reason for the increase in operating leases as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december forward air depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a million  or as a percentage of revenue  increase in amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of pinch and black hawk 
the remaining increase represents depreciation on new forklifts and other miscellaneous equipment and assets 
fasi fasi depreciation and amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of fasi operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was partially due to a million  or as a percentage of revenue  increase in amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the service express  pinch and usac acquisitions 
the remainder of the increase was attributable to a full year of depreciation on assets acquired from usac and increased depreciation from tractors  trailers and other equipment assumed in conjunction with our acquisitions of pinch and service express 
insurance and claims insurance and claims expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims was of consolidated operating revenue during compared with in forward air insurance and claims as a percentage of forward air s operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million and increase in insurance and claims for the year ended compared to the year ended december  was the result of increased insurance premiums resulting from the increased number of owner operators  company employed drivers  and rolling stock equipment in our fleet 
fasi fasi insurance and claims increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenue was attributable to the increase in revenue outpacing the increase in claims and insurance premiums 
fuel expense fuel expense increased million  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air fuel expense was of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily attributable to the increased number of company employed drivers and company owned or operated equipment as a result of the pinch and black hawk acquisitions in march and december  respectively 
also increasing fuel expense was the significant year over year increase in average diesel fuel prices during the second and third quarters of fasi fasi fuel expense increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fuel expenses were of fasi operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi fuel expense was significantly higher as a percentage of operating revenue than forward air s fuel expense  as fasi utilizes a higher ratio of company employed drivers and company owned or leased vehicles in its operations than forward air 
the increase in fasi fuel expense was attributable to the increase in owned and leased tractors assumed with the pinch and service express acquisitions 
the increase was also attributable to the year ended including a full year of fasi activity as opposed to only five months for also increasing fuel expense was the significant year over year increase in average diesel fuel prices during the second and third quarters of other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with in the same period of forward air other operating expenses were of forward air s operating revenue in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was the result of efforts to control discretionary costs by reducing expenses such as management training  marketing and travel 
in addition  during the year ended december  other operating expenses were reduced by million related to the reversal of previous accruals for fines and penalties associated with the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority 
the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority for less than the amount previously reserved 
fasi fasi other operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase is mainly attributable to the year ended  including twelve months of expense while included only five months  as fasi was not operating until july  fasi other operating expenses for the year ended december  were of the segment s operating revenue compared to for the december  other operating expenses are higher as a percentage of revenue than our forward air segment due to the higher utilization of company owned or leased vehicles resulting in higher maintenance and related expenses 
income from operations income from operations decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  income from operations was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december forward air income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of increased revenues partially offset by increased costs for salaries  wages and benefits  operating leases and depreciation and amortization 
income from operations as a percentage of forward air s operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in income from operations as a percentage of revenue was the result of increasing volumes from our lower margin services  such as tlx  and declining airport to airport volumes mainly during the fourth quarter of due to the economic recession 
fasi fasi results from operations decreased approximately million to a million loss from operations for the year ended december  from income of operations of million for the year ended december  the decrease in fasi results from operations was mainly driven by integration costs that resulted from the march  acquisition of pinch 
these costs primarily impacted salaries  wages  and employee benefits  operating leases and other operating expenses 
the loss from operations as a percentage of fasi operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared with income from operations as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  as discussed above  the pool distribution business is highly seasonal and as a result of the timing of the usac acquisition  our results primarily included peak seasonal activity 
consequently  our results were better than we would expect for a full year of operations  such as  which would include less positive results from the non peak periods of operations 
in addition  fasi s fourth quarter of income from operations of million was million less than the million of income from operations for the fourth quarter of this was primarily the result of lower peak season volumes than anticipated due to the current economic recession 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was mostly the result of net borrowings under our line of credit facility used to fund our acquisitions of service express  pinch and black hawk in september  march and december  respectively 
these increases were net of a million reduction of interest expense resulting from the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority during the year ended december  the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority for less than the amount previously reserved 
other income  net other income  net was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income was attributable to reduced tax exempt interest income due to decreased average cash and investment balances as a result of cash used for the acquisition of usac in july and stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  our effective federal and state rate increased to provide for the decrease in tax exempt interest income as discussed above and the disallowance of share based compensation on qualified stock options 
however  during the year ended december  we reduced the provision for state income taxes by million  net of federal benefit  for the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority 
the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority for less than the previously reserved amount 
net income as a result of the foregoing factors  net income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  discussion of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings or accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at for forward air and for fasi 
if circumstances change ie  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be changed by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise i when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  ii when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  iii when billing errors occur  and iv when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately million  on average revenue per month of approximately million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the preceding twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 
self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle and general liability  workers compensation and health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding million and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding approximately million  except in ohio  where we are a qualified self insured entity with an approximately million self insured retention 
the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year s estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
additionally  we utilize actuarial analysis to evaluate open vehicle liability and workers compensation claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
revenue recognition operating revenue and related costs are recognized as of the date shipments are completed 
the transportation rates we charge our customers consist of base transportation rates and fuel surcharge rates 
the revenues earned and related direct freight expenses incurred from our base transportation services are recognized on a gross basis in revenue and in purchased transportation 
transportation revenue is recognized on a gross basis as we are the primary obligor 
the fuel surcharges billed to customers and paid to owner operators and third party transportation providers are recorded on a net basis in revenue as we are not the primary obligor with regards to the fuel surcharges 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
also  beginning january   we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expenses  respectively 
valuation of goodwill we conduct an annual or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment impairment test of goodwill for each reportable segment at the end of the second quarter of each year 
the tests are based on judgments regarding the market value of our common stock  ongoing profitability and cash flow of the reportable segments and underlying assets 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believe is impaired 
for example  during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with our accounting policy discussed above as of march  based on the results of the interim impairment test  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
consequently  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during the first quarter of share based compensation our general practice has been to make a single annual grant to key employees and to generally make other grants only in connection with new employment or promotions 
in addition  we make annual grants to non employee directors in conjunction with their annual election to our board of directors or at the time of their appointment to the board of directors 
during the year ended december   we granted non vested shares to key employees  but returned to granting stock options during the year ended december  we returned to granting stock options to key employees  as we believe stock options more closely link long term compensation with our long term goals 
for non employee directors  we have granted non vested shares annually beginning in stock options typically expire seven years from the grant date and vest ratably over a three year period 
the share based compensation for stock options are recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period 
based on our historical experience  forfeitures are estimated 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of options granted 
the fair value of non vested shares issued were estimated using the closing market prices for the business day of the grant 
the share based compensation for the non vested shares is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period or vesting period 
forfeitures are estimated based on our historical experience  but will be adjusted for future changes in forfeiture experience 
under the espp  which has been approved by our shareholders  we are authorized to issue shares of common stock to our employees 
these shares may be issued at a price equal to of the lesser of the market value on the first day or the last day of each six month purchase period 
common stock purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions and or up to two large lump sum contributions 
as the espp does not qualify as non compensatory  we recognize share based compensation on the date of purchase based on the difference between the purchase date fair market value and the employee purchase price 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements during september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance regarding fair value measurements  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb delayed the effective date of the fair value guidance for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until january  we adopted the new fair value guidance on january  for all financial assets and liabilities and on january  for nonfinancial assets 
this adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations other than considerations used in the fair value calculations of our goodwill impairment tests 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to rules governing business combinations 
the revised guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the revised business combination guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this guidance was effective january  the impact of this revised guidance will depend on the nature of our business combinations subsequent to january in december  the fasb amended guidance regarding noncontrolling interests and the treatment of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the amended guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest  and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the amended guidance also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
the adoption of the amended guidance on january   did not have a significant impact on the our financial position  results of operations and cash flows as we do not currently have any noncontrolling interests in other entities 
we adopted the fasb s new rule regarding subsequent events in the second quarter of the fasb s new rule establishes the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the new subsequent event guidance requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
see note of the condensed consolidated financial statements herein for the related disclosures 
the adoption of the new subsequent event rule did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended rules regarding the transfer and servicing of financial assets and the extinguishment of financial assets 
the amended guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  clarifies and amends the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale  amends and clarifies the unit of account eligible for sale accounting  and requires that a transferor initially be measured at fair value and recognize all assets obtained for example beneficial interests and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of an entire financial asset or group of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
additionally  on and after the effective date of the amended guidance  existing qspes as defined under previous accounting guidance must be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
the amended guidance requires enhanced disclosures about  among other things  a transferor s continuing involvement with transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales  the risks inherent in the transferred financial assets that have been retained  and the nature and financial effect of restrictions on the transferor s assets that continue to be reported in the statement of financial position 
we will adopt the amended guidance on january   but at this time we do not anticipate the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june  the fasb amended its rules regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities vie 
the fasb also amended the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
previously  fasb rules required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
qspes  which were previously exempt from the application of rules regarding vies  will be subject to the provisions of these new rules when they become effective 
the amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
we will adopt the amended rules on january   but at this time we do not anticipate the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles the fasb codification was implemented 
the fasb codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place for nongovernmental entities 
the fasb codification was effective for us in the third quarter of  and all subsequent public filings will reference the fasb codification as the sole source of authoritative literature 
the adoption of the fasb codification did not impact our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital expenditures  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to a million reduction in net earnings after consideration of non cash items 
the decrease in net earnings after consideration of non cash items was largely offset by a million change in working capital 
changes in accounts receivable improved cash flow from operations by million as collections on receivables improved due to the reorganization of our billing and collections department which has allowed us to increase the speed and accuracy of our billing as well as address collection issues in a more timely manner 
the million decrease in cash used for income taxes is attributable to decreases in our estimated federal and state income tax payments due to the overall reduction in our before tax earnings 
the million decrease in cash used for accounts payable and prepaid expense is attributable to a reduction in payments to vendors in conjunction with the decline in our business volumes as well as timing of payroll and owner operator settlements 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in investing activities during the year ended december  investing activities during the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in capital expenditures for the construction of our regional hub in dallas fort worth  texas

net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million provided by financing activities during the year ended december  cash used in financing activities during mainly included our quarterly dividend payments and scheduled capital lease payments 
the change in financing activities for compared to was attributable to a million reduction in net borrowings from our senior credit facility and a million reduction in cash from the exercise and the tax benefit or expense from employee stock option exercises 
prior year net borrowings from our line of credit were used to partially fund the pinch and service express acquisitions 
on october   we entered into a million senior credit facility 
the facility has a term of five years and includes an accordion feature  which if approved by our lender  allows for an additional million in borrowings on such terms and conditions as set forth in the credit agreement 
interest rates for advances under the senior credit facility are at libor plus to based upon covenants related to total indebtness to earnings 
we entered into this new  larger credit facility in order to fund potential acquisitions  repurchases of our common stock  and for financing other general business purposes 
at december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility  not including the accordion feature  and had utilized million of availability for outstanding letters of credit 
on november   we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to three million shares of common stock the repurchase plan 
in addition  on july   our board of directors approved an additional stock repurchase program for up to two million shares of our common stock the repurchase plan 
no shares were repurchased during the years ended december  and for the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares  for million or per share under the repurchase plan and repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock under the repurchase plan for million  or per share 
as of december   no shares remained eligible for purchase under the repurchase plan and  shares remained eligible for repurchase under the repurchase plan 
in june  we completed the construction of our new regional hub in dallas fort worth for a total cost of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we completed our purchase of new facilities near chicago  illinois and atlanta  georgia for million and million  respectively 
deposits of million and million paid during were applied to the purchase price of the chicago and atlanta facilities  respectively 
we funded the expenditures for the construction or purchase of these facilities through cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities 
during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  and  cash dividends of per share were declared on common stock outstanding 
we expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends  though each subsequent quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
we believe that our available cash  investments  expected cash generated from future operations and borrowings under the available senior credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had letters of credit outstanding from banks totaling million required primarily by our workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands are summarized below contractual obligations payment due period and total thereafter capital lease obligations other long term debt operating leases senior credit facility total contractual cash obligations as of december   we had a commitment to acquire new tractors and straight trucks for approximately million during this commitment is expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flows from operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates principally to changes in interest rates and fuel prices 
our interest rate exposure relates principally to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility  which represents an aggregate principal amount of million at december   bears interest at variable rates 
based on our outstanding borrowings at december   a hypothetical increase in our senior credit facility borrowing rate of basis points  or an increase in the total effective interest rate from to  would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million and would have decreased our annual cash flow from operations by approximately million 
our only other debt is equipment notes and capital lease obligations totaling million 
these notes and lease obligations all bear interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  there is no exposure to market risk related to these notes and capital lease obligations 
we are exposed to the effects of changes in the price and availability of diesel fuel  as more fully discussed in item a  risk factors 
our cash and cash equivalents are also subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk
