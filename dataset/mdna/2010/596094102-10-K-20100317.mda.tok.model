the company generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by middleburg bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
middleburg bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses or potential other than temporary impairment of securities middleburg investment group s subsidiaries  middleburg trust company and middleburg investment advisors  generate fee income by providing investment management and trust services to its clients 
investment management and trust fees are generally based upon the value of assets under management  and  therefore can be significantly affected by fluctuations in the values of securities caused by changes in the capital markets 
southern trust mortgage generates fees from the origination and sale of mortgages loans 
southern trust mortgage also maintains a real estate construction portfolio and receives interest and fee income from these loans  which  net of interest expense  is included in net interest income 
at december   total assets were million  a decrease of from million 
total loans  including mortgages held for sale decreased million from million at december  to million at december  total deposits increased million from million at december  to million at december  lower cost deposits  including demand checking  interest checking and savings increased million or from the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  higher cost time deposits  excluding brokered certificates of deposit  increased or million from the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the shift in the mix of deposits as well as lower interest rates paid on deposits during contributed to the basis point decrease in the overall cost of deposits from to the net interest margin  a non gaap measure more fully described in the results of operations section below  increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase is attributed to the basis point decrease in yield of total interest bearing liabilities as compared to the basis point decrease  on a tax equivalent basis  in yield of total interest bearing assets 
the provision for loan losses decreased  for the year ended december  to million compared to million for the same period in the company recognized other than temporary impairment on trust preferred securities of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in total non interest income increased million for the year ended december   compared to same period in the increase is largely due to gains on the sale of loans by the company s mortgage banking subsidiary  southern trust mortgage 
non interest expense in increased million  up from  driven primarily by commissions related to the increased production at southern trust mortgage  increased fdic insurance expense and increased legal and oreo expenses 
total non interest expenses for the year ended december  includes the consolidated expenses of southern trust mortgage  while the same period in include a one time impairment charge of million 
although  the company is focused on keeping growth in non interest expense low in the future  because of the company s plans to engage in growth and expansion  it is expected that non interest expense will continue to grow in the future at a rate similar to previous years  excluding the impairment charge of the company remains well capitalized with risk adjusted core capital and total capital ratios well above the regulatory minimums 
with the creation of middleburg investment group  the company has expanded the integration of middleburg trust company  middleburg investment advisors and middleburg bank s investment services department into a more focused wealth management program for all of the company s clients 
the company intends to make each of its wealth management services available within all of its financial service centers 
also  through the affiliation with southern trust mortgage  middleburg bank plans to continue to increase its loan portfolio by purchasing high credit quality  low loan to value first deeds of trusts on residential property 
middleburg bank plans to continue its focus on low cost deposit growth with advertising campaigns and product development 
the company is not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authorities that  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the registrant s liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to some degree  dependent upon the accounting policies of the company 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important critical accounting policies to the portrayal and understanding of middleburg bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
allowance for loan losses middleburg bank monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
middleburg bank maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
middleburg bank evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by applicable accounting guidance 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due by days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  middleburg bank makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by applicable accounting standards loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriti ng standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of loans losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of middleburg bank as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses is below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
middleburg bank recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
intangibles and goodwill the company has approximately million in intangible assets and goodwill at december   a decrease of  since december  which was attributable to regular amortization of intangible assets 
on april   the company acquired middleburg investment advisors  a registered investment advisor  for million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
in connection with this investment  a purchase price valuation was completed to determine the appropriate allocation to identified intangibles 
the valuation concluded that approximately of the purchase price was related to the acquisition of customer relationships with an amortizable life of years 
another of the purchase price was allocated to a non compete agreement with an amortizable life of years 
the remainder of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill 
approximately million of the million in intangible assets and goodwill at december  is attributable to the company s investment in middleburg trust company 
with the consolidation of southern trust mortgage  the company recognized million in goodwill as part of its equity investment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for the life span of various customer relationships as well as the value that key members of management add to the success of the company 
for example  customer attrition rates were determined based upon assumptions that the past five years may predict the future 
if the actual attrition rates  among other assumptions  differed from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration in the amortization expense 
in addition  accounting standards require that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
processes and procedures have been identified for the two step process 
when the company completes its ongoing review of the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill  factors that are considered important to determining whether impairment might exist include loss of customers acquired or significant withdrawals of the assets currently under management and or early retirement or termination of key members of management 
any changes in the key management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
tax equivalent interest income tax equivalent interest income is gross interest income adjusted for the non taxable interest income earned on loans  municipal securities and corporate securities  which are dividend received deduction eligible 
the effective tax rate of is used in calculating tax equivalent income related to loans  municipal securities and corporate securities 
a dividend received deduction of is used in determining tax equivalent income related to corporate securities  as well 
other than temporary impairment otti approximately million in losses related to other than temporary impairment on trust preferred securities was recognized in at december   the company had million in trust preferred securities in its portfolio 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  we determine other than temporary impairment for the trust preferred securities in the securities portfolio based on an evaluation of the underlying collateral 
we developed cash flow projections based upon assumptions of default deferral rates  recovery rates and prepayment rates for the collateral 
the present value of the projected cash flows was calculated by discounting the projected cash flows using the effective yield at purchase in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
finally  the present values of the projected cash flows were compared to the carrying values of the securities 
if the present values were less than the carrying value  we determined that the security had an other than temporary impairment equal to the difference between the present value and the carry ing value of the bond 
the company may need to recognize additional other than temporary impairments related to trust preferred securities in we evaluate our default assumptions and cash flow projections in relation to the credit performance of the collateral that underlies the trust preferred securities 
should additional deferrals defaults occur on the collateral  projected cash flows from the collateral could be reduced which could result in other than temporary impairments in results of operations net income net income for was million  an increase of from the net income of million

net interest income net interest income represents the principal source of earnings of the company 
net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december  this is an increase of over the million reported for the same period in net interest income for increased over the million reported for the net interest margin increased basis points to in the net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets 
because a portion of interest income earned by the company is nontaxable  the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio 
tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense

total interest expense for was million  a decrease of million compared to the total interest expense for the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points over the year ended december  management believes that the net interest margin could compress during based on conservative internal interest rate risk models and the assumption of a sustained low rate environment  the company expects net interest income to trend downward slightly throughout the next months as loan related assets reprice and the decline in funding costs slows 
the expected decrease to net interest income could be or million in a month period of rising rates of basis points 
it is anticipated that targeted growth in earning assets and liability repricing opportunities will help mitigate the above mentioned impact to the company s net interest margin

the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions that they may have in prior years or that the allocation indicates future loan loss trends 
additionally  the proportion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount that may be available for the future losses that could occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the total portfolio

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and interest rate swaps 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement middleburg bank has in particular classes of financial instruments 
middleburg bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
middleburg bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
a summary of the contract amount of middleburg bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and is as follows financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
middleburg bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by middleburg bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income pro ducing commercial properties

the company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding rate lock commitments 
rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives 
the period of time between a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from to days 
the company mitigates its risk from changes in interest rates through the use of best effort forward delivery commitments  whereby the company commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on the loan 
as a result  the company is not exposed to losses nor will it realize significant gain s related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates 
the correlation between the rate lock commitments and the best efforts contracts is very high due to their similarity 
the market value of rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts is not readily ascertainable with precision because rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
the company determines the fair value of rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts by measuring the change in the value of the underlying asset while taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close 
because of the high correlation between rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts  no gain or loss occurs on the rate lock commitments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  though it should be noted that the assets under management by middleburg trust company are affected by equity price risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved every three years baring any significant changes 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability comm ittee alco of middleburg bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward shift and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
the following reflects the range of the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis during the fiscal years of and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
estimated net interest income sensitivity rate change december  december  bps bps at the end of  the company s final interest rate risk model indicated that in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could decrease by 
for the same time period  the final interest rate risk model indicated that  in a declining rate environment of basis points over a month period  net interest income could decrease by 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced and is working to minimize risks to rising rates in the future 
since december   the company s balance sheet has shrunk by million 
overall  middleburg bank continues to have minimal interest rate risks to either falling or rising interest rates 
based upon final simulation  middleburg bank could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of million over the next months if rates rise basis points 
if rates were to decline basis points  based upon final simulation middleburg bank could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of million over the next months 
a decline of basis points is highly unlikely given the current interest rate environment 
the company s specific goal is to lower where possible the cost of its borrowed funds 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cashflows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates
