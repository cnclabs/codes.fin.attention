this investment provides the group a further opportunity to expand outside of its traditional geographic regions 
the agricultural commodity based business is one in which changes in selling prices generally move in relationship to changes in purchase prices 
therefore  increases or decreases in prices of the agricultural commodities that the company deals in will have a relatively equal impact on sales and cost of sales and a minimal impact on gross profit 
as a result  changes in sales for the period may not necessarily be indicative of the group s overall performance and more focus should be placed on changes to merchandising revenues and service income 
grain inventories on hand at december  were million bushels  of which million bushels were stored for others 
this compares to million bushels on hand at december   of which million bushels were stored for others

although the company has experienced a significant decline in utilization in its railcar business  due to the nature of these long lived assets low carrying values and year average remaining useful lives  the current economic environment impacting the rail industry would have to persist on a long term basis for the company s railcar assets to be impaired and the company does not believe this will occur 
the company is also currently evaluating its railcar portfolio to determine if it would be more cost effective to scrap certain cars rather than continue to incur storage costs 
as of december   cars had been identified and depreciation was accelerated on those railcars to reflect their shortened useful lives

the significantly decreased earnings resulted in lower income taxes due and as of december  the company had over paid its income tax liability for the year 
the majority of this over payment was refunded in the first quarter of investing activities total capital spending for on property  plant and equipment within the company s base business was million  which includes million in the plant nutrient group  million in the grain ethanol group  million in the turf specialty group  million in the retail group  million in the rail group and million in corporate purchases 
in addition to spending on conventional property  plant and equipment  the company spent million in for the purchase of railcars and capitalized modifications on railcars  partially offset by proceeds from the sales and dispositions of railcars of million 
in august  the company acquired of the assets of the fertilizer division of hartung brothers  inc hbi

financing arrangements the company has significant committed short term lines of credit available to finance working capital  primarily inventories  margin calls on commodity contracts and accounts receivable 
the company is party to a borrowing arrangement with a syndicate of banks  which was amended in april  to provide the company with million in short term lines of credit and million in long term lines of credit 
the company had nothing drawn on its short term line of credit at either december  or peak borrowing on the line of credit during was million on february th 
typically  the company s highest borrowing occurs in the spring due to seasonal inventory requirements in the fertilizer and retail businesses  credit sales of fertilizer and a customary reduction in grain payables due to the cash needs and market strategies of grain customers 
certain of the company s long term borrowings include covenants that  among other things  impose minimum levels of working capital and equity  and limitations on additional debt 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  in addition  certain of the company s long term borrowings are collateralized by first mortgages on various facilities or are collateralized by railcar assets 
the company s non recourse long term debt is collateralized by railcar and locomotive assets 
the company paid per common share for the dividends paid in january and april  per common share for the dividends paid in july and october and january  per common share for the dividends paid in april  july and october and january during  the company issued approximately  shares to employees and directors under its share compensation plans 
in addition  the company repurchased approximately  shares during the first quarter of for million 
because the company is a significant consumer of short term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt  increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on the profitability of the company 
in addition  periods of high grain prices and or unfavorable market conditions could require the company to make additional margin deposits on its exchange traded futures contracts 
conversely  in periods of declining prices  the company receives a return of cash 
the recent volatility in the capital and credit markets has had a significant impact on the economy 
despite this volatile and challenging economic environment  the company has continued to have good access to the credit markets 
the company s short term credit facility has a three year commitment and expires in september in the unlikely event that the company were faced with a situation where it was not able to access the capital markets including through the renewal of its line of credit  the company believes it could successfully implement contingency plans to maintain adequate liquidity such as expanding or contracting the amount of its forward grain contracting  which will reduce the impact of grain price volatility on its daily margin calls 
additionally  the company could begin to liquidate its stored grain inventory as well as execute sales contracts with its customers that align the timing of the receipt of grain from its producers to the shipment of grain to its customers thereby freeing up working capital that is typically utilized to store the grain for extended periods of time 
the company believes that its operating cash flow  the marketability of its grain inventories  other liquidity contingency plans and its access to sufficient sources of liquidity  will enable it to meet its ongoing funding requirements 
at december   the company had million available under its lines of credit

see narrative description of business for the grain ethanol group in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
d other long term liabilities include estimated obligations under our retiree healthcare programs and the estimated contribution to our defined benefit pension plan 
obligations under the retiree healthcare programs are not fixed commitments and will vary depending on various factors  including the level of participant utilization and inflation 
our estimates of postretirement payments through have considered recent payment trends and actuarial assumptions 
we have not estimated pension contributions beyond due to the significant impact that return on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts 
the company had standby letters of credit outstanding of million at december  off balance sheet transactions the company s rail group utilizes leasing arrangements that provide off balance sheet financing for its activities 
the company leases railcars from financial intermediaries through sale leaseback transactions  the majority of which involve operating leasebacks 
railcars owned by the company  or leased by the company from a financial intermediary  are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to a financial intermediary  and assigns the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non recourse basis 
in such arrangements  the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediary  and receives a fee for such services 
on most of the railcars and locomotives  the company holds an option to purchase these assets at the end of the lease 
the following table describes the railcar and locomotive positions of the rail group at december  method of control financial statement number owned railcars available for sale on balance sheet current owned railcar assets leased to others on balance sheet non current  railcars leased from financial intermediaries off balance sheet  railcars non recourse arrangements off balance sheet  total railcars locomotive assets leased to others on balance sheet non current locomotives leased from financial intermediaries off balance sheet locomotives leased from financial intermediaries under limited recourse arrangements off balance sheet locomotives non recourse arrangements off balance sheet total locomotives in addition  the company manages approximately railcars for third party customers or owners for which it receives a fee 
the company has future lease payment commitments aggregating million for the railcars leased by the company from financial intermediaries under various operating leases 
remaining lease terms vary with none exceeding eleven years 
the company prefers non recourse lease transactions  whenever possible  in order to minimize its credit risk 
refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s leasing activities 
in addition to the railcar counts above  the grain ethanol group owns railcars which it leases to third parties under operating leases 
these cars are included in railcar assets leased to others in the consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting estimates are considered critical  as they are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  however  they are not deemed critical as defined above 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item describes our significant accounting policies which should be read in conjunction with our critical accounting estimates 
grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain and ethanol  over the counter grain and ethanol contracts  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the overall market for grain inventories is very liquid and active  market value is determined by reference to prices for identical commodities on the chicago mercantile exchange adjusted primarily for transportation costs  and the company s grain inventories may be sold without significant additional processing 
the company uses forward purchase and sale contracts and both exchange traded and over the counter contracts such as derivatives governed by the international swap dealers association 
management estimates fair value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets  as well as counter party non performance risk in the case of forward and over the counter contracts 
the amount of risk  and therefore the impact to the fair value of the contracts  varies by type of contract and type of counter party 
with the exception of specific customers thought to be at higher risk  the company looks at the contracts in total  segregated by contract type  in its assessment of nonperformance risk 
for those customers that are thought to be at higher risk  the company makes assumptions as to performance based on past history and facts about the current situation 
changes in fair value are recorded as a component of sales and merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
if management used different methods or factors to estimate fair value or if there were changes in economic circumstances or deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to the contracts  the amounts reported as inventories  commodity derivative assets and liabilities and sales and merchandising revenues could differ 
at december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  of fair value allowances relating to non performance risk 
impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments the company s various business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or railcars 
in addition  the company has a limited amount of intangible assets and goodwill described more fully in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item that it acquired in various business combinations 
whenever changing conditions warrant  the company assesses whether the realizability of the company s impacted tangible and intangible assets may be impaired 
although the company has experienced a significant decline in utilization in its railcar business  due to the nature of these long lived assets low carrying values and year average remaining useful lives  the current economic environment impacting the rail industry would have to persist on a long term basis for the company s railcar assets to be impaired and the company does not believe this will occur 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
these reviews for impairment take into account estimates of future undiscounted  and as appropriate discounted  cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these cash flows  the company could recognize different amounts of expense in future periods 
the company also holds investments in limited liability companies that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the company reviews its investments to determine whether there has been a decline in the estimated fair value of the investment that is below the company s carrying value which is other than temporary 
at december   the company s total investment in entities accounted for under the equity method was million 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the company records its non grain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
whenever changing conditions warrant  the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventory compared to the current market 
market price is determined using both external data  such as current selling prices by third parties and quoted trading prices for the same or similar products  and internal data  such as the company s current ask price and expectations on normal margins 
if the evaluation indicates that the company s inventory is being carried at values higher than the current market can support  the company will write down its inventory to its best estimate of net realizable value 
employee benefit plans the company provides all full time  non retail employees with pension benefits and full time employees hired before january  with postretirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future healthcare cost trends 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
in  the company s defined benefit pension plans were frozen effective july  taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand created by population growth and higher standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in purchase and sale commitments for grain and grain held in inventory  the company enters into exchange traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges 
the market value of exchange traded futures and options used for economic hedging has a high  but not perfect correlation  to the underlying market value of grain inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the less correlated portion of inventory and purchase and sale contract market value known as basis is much less volatile than the overall market value of exchange traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns 
the company manages this less volatile risk using its daily grain position report to constantly monitor its position relative to the price changes in the market 
in addition  inventory values are affected by the month to month spread relationships in the regulated futures markets  as the company carries inventories over time 
these spread relationships are also less volatile than the overall market value and tend to follow historical patterns but also represent a risk that cannot be directly offset 
the company s accounting policy for its futures and options  as well as the underlying inventory positions and purchase and sale contracts  is to mark them to the market price daily and include gains and losses in the statement of income in sales and merchandising revenues 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position exclusive of basis risk 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december  in thousands net long short position market risk interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates and credit ratings for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
in addition  the company has derivative interest rate contracts recorded in its balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on quoted market termination values 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december  in thousands fair value of long term debt and interest rate contracts fair value in excess of less than carrying value market risk
