overview we are committed to discovering  developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases 
through our integrated drug discovery and development activities  we are building a portfolio of novel compounds that we believe have the potential to be high quality  differentiated pharmaceutical products that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients 
the majority of our programs focus on discovery and development of small molecule drugs for cancer 
we have devoted significant resources to build a leading discovery platform that has enabled us to efficiently and rapidly identify highly qualified drug candidates that meet our extensive development criteria 
our goal has been to generate a diverse and deep pipeline while focusing our resources on those drug candidates that we believe have the highest therapeutic and commercial potential 
the rapid development of three of those drug candidates is a primary focus of the company 
xl  our most advanced drug candidate  inhibits met  vegfr and ret  proteins that are key drivers of tumor growth and or vascularization 
xl is the most advanced inhibitor of met in clinical development and is being evaluated in a broad development program in collaboration with bristol myers squibb company 
we currently are conducting the majority of the development activity for xl  and our collaboration agreement provides for the sharing of development costs 
a global phase registration trial of xl as a potential treatment for medullary thyroid cancer is currently enrolling 
assuming positive results from this registration trial  we currently expect to submit a new drug application  or nda  for xl as a treatment for medullary thyroid cancer in the united states in the second half of in addition  comprehensive phase clinical trials of xl in glioblastoma  non small cell lung cancer and other solid tumor indications are ongoing 
we are currently planning to initiate a phase registration trial of xl as a potential treatment for recurrent glioblastoma by the end of  assuming a positive outcome of the ongoing phase clinical evaluation in this indication 
we are also actively pursuing the development of xl and xl  leading inhibitors of phosphoinositide kinase  or pik  that we out licensed to sanofi aventis in xl is a selective inhibitor of pik while xl is a dual inhibitor of pik and mtor 
sanofi aventis is responsible for funding all development activities with respect to xl and xl  including our activities 
we currently are conducting the majority of the clinical trials for these compounds 
xl and xl are currently being evaluated in a series of phase b clinical trials for a variety of solid tumor indications and a broad phase clinical trial program that commenced in early 
table of contents we also have several earlier novel drug candidates in clinical development for the treatment of cancer  and preclinical programs for cancer  metabolic disease and inflammation 
based on the strength of our expertise in biology  drug discovery and development  we have established collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including bristol myers squibb  sanofi aventis  genentech  boehringer ingelheim gmbh and glaxosmithkline  that allow us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our pipeline 
our collaborations generally fall into one of two categories collaborations in which we co develop compounds with a partner  share development costs and profits from commercialization and may have the right to co promote products in the united states  and collaborations in which we out license compounds to a partner for further development and commercialization  have no further unreimbursed cost obligations and are entitled to receive milestones and royalties or a share of profits from commercialization 
under either form of collaboration  we may also be entitled to license fees  research funding and milestone payments from research results and subsequent product development activities 
our strategy our business strategy is to leverage our biological expertise and integrated research and development capabilities to generate a pipeline of development compounds with significant therapeutic and commercial potential for the treatment of cancer and potentially other serious diseases 
our strategy consists of three principal elements focus on lead clinical compounds we are focusing our development efforts on xl  xl and xl these drug candidates are the most advanced in our pipeline and we believe that they have the greatest near term therapeutic and commercial potential 
as a result  we are dedicating the majority of our resources to aggressively advance these drug candidates through development toward commercialization 
partner compounds we continue to pursue new collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and ultimate commercialization of some of our preclinical and clinical compounds  particularly those drug candidates for which we believe that the capabilities and resources of a partner can accelerate development and help to fully realize their therapeutic and commercial potential 
collaborations also provide us with a means of shifting all or a portion of the development costs related to such drug candidates and provide financial resources that we can apply to fund our share of the development of our lead clinical compounds and other areas of our pipeline 
our goal is to significantly increase the portion of our development expenses that are reimbursed by partners while maintaining financial upside from potential downstream milestones and royalties if these drug candidates were to be marketed in the future 
control costs we are committed to managing our costs  and we continually analyze our expenses to ensure they are not disproportionate to our cash resources 
we are selective with respect to funding our clinical development programs and have established definitive go no go criteria to ensure that we commit our resources only to those programs that we believe have the greatest commercial and therapeutic potential 
we also retain the right to opt out of the development of certain drug candidates that we are currently co developing with partners 
as a consequence of our strategy of focusing our resources on our most advanced clinical compounds and controlling costs  on march  we implemented a restructuring of the company that resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately  or employees 
while we will continue to maintain an integrated research and development organization  the reduction in our workforce was weighted towards our drug discovery group 
we have maintained capabilities in all aspects of drug discovery and expect to continue to generate novel investigational new drug application  or ind  ready compounds  although fewer on a yearly basis for the foreseeable future than we have generated historically 
we have retained the ability to meet all of our obligations 
table of contents to existing partners 
further  as a result of our retained research capabilities and our numerous unpartnered clinical and preclinical compounds  we expect that our ongoing and planned future business development discussions will be unaffected by the restructuring 
we believe that the restructuring increases our financial strength and positions us for longer term sustainable growth 
certain factors important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations successful development of drugs is inherently difficult and uncertain 
our business requires significant investments in research and development over many years  often for products that fail during the research and development process 
our long term prospects depend upon our ability and the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize new therapeutics in highly competitive areas such as cancer treatment 
our financial performance is driven by many factors  including those described below 
limited sources of revenues we currently have no pharmaceutical products that have received marketing approval  and we have generated no revenues to date from the sale of such products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products in the near term and expect that all of our near term revenues  such as research and development funding  license fees and milestone payments and royalty revenues  will be generated from collaboration agreements with our current and potential future partners 
milestones under these agreements may be tied to factors that are outside of our control  such as significant clinical or regulatory events with respect to compounds that have been licensed to our partners 
clinical trials we currently have multiple compounds in clinical development and expect to expand the development programs for our compounds 
our compounds may fail to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
furthermore  predicting the timing of the initiation or completion of clinical trials is difficult  and our trials may be delayed due to many factors  including factors outside of our control 
the future development path of each of our compounds depends upon the results of each stage of clinical development 
in general  we will incur increased operating expenses for compounds that advance in clinical development  whereas expenses will end for compounds that do not warrant further clinical development 
we are responsible for all development costs for compounds in our pipeline that are not partnered and for a portion of development costs for those compounds that we are co developing with partners 
we share development costs with partners in our co development collaborations and have no unreimbursed cost obligations with respect to compounds that we have out licensed 
we expect that over the next several years an increasingly greater portion of our development expenses will be funded by our partners 
liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities  which included restricted cash and investments of million 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities and funding that we expect to receive from collaborators  which includes anticipated cash from additional business development activity  will enable us to maintain our operations  after giving effect to the restructuring we implemented on march   for a period of at least months following the filing date of this report 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and depend on many factors  including the following whether we repay amounts outstanding under our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline described below in cash or shares of our common stock  
table of contents the progress and scope of the development activity with respect to xl  our most advanced compound  the progress and scope of other research and development activities conducted by us  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the degree to which we conduct funded development activity on behalf of partners to whom we have out licensed compounds  and our ability to enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements that provide additional payments 
our minimum liquidity needs are also determined by financial covenants in our loan and security agreement  as amended  with glaxosmithkline and our collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for xl  as well as other factors  which are described under liquidity and capital resources cash requirements 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if any of our product candidates fails to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
sanofi aventis in may  we entered into a global license agreement with sanofi aventis for xl and xl and a broad collaboration for the discovery of inhibitors of pik for the treatment of cancer 
the license agreement and collaboration agreement became effective on july  in connection with the effectiveness of the license and collaboration  on july   we received upfront payments of million million for the license and million for the collaboration  less applicable withholding taxes of million  for a net receipt of million 
we expect to receive a refund payment from the french government in with respect to the withholding taxes previously withheld 
under the license agreement  sanofi aventis received a worldwide exclusive license to xl and xl  which are currently in phase  phase b and phase clinical trials  and has sole responsibility for all subsequent clinical  regulatory  commercial and manufacturing activities 
it is expected that we will continue to participate in the conduct of ongoing and potential future clinical trials and manufacturing activities 
sanofi aventis is responsible for funding all future development activities with respect to xl and xl  including our activities 
under the collaboration agreement  the parties are combining efforts in establishing several pre clinical pik programs and jointly share responsibility for research and preclinical activities related to isoform selective inhibitors of pik a and b 
sanofi aventis will provide us with guaranteed annual research and development funding during the research term and is responsible for funding all development activities for each product following approval of the investigational new drug application filed with the applicable regulatory authorities for such product 
sanofi aventis will have sole responsibility for all subsequent clinical  regulatory  commercial and manufacturing activities of any products arising from the collaboration  however  we may be requested to conduct certain clinical trials at sanofi aventis expense 
the research term under the collaboration is three years  although sanofi aventis has the right to extend the term for an additional one year period upon prior written notice 
in addition to the aggregate upfront cash payments for the license and collaboration agreements  we are entitled to receive guaranteed research funding of million over three years to cover certain of our costs under the collaboration agreement 
for both the license and the collaboration combined  we will be eligible to receive development  regulatory and commercial milestones of over billion in the aggregate  as well as royalties on sales of any products commercialized under the license or collaboration 

table of contents sanofi aventis may  upon certain prior notice to us  terminate the license as to products containing xl or xl in the event of such termination election  sanofi aventis license relating to such product would terminate and revert to us  and we would receive  subject to certain terms  conditions and potential payment obligations  licenses from sanofi aventis to research  develop and commercialize such products 
the collaboration will automatically terminate under certain circumstances upon the expiration of the research term  in which case all licenses granted by the parties to each other would terminate and revert to the respective party  subject to sanofi aventis right to receive  under certain circumstances  the first opportunity to obtain a license from us to any isoform selective pik inhibitor 
in addition  sanofi aventis may  upon certain prior written notice to us  terminate the collaboration in whole or as to certain products following expiration of the research term  in which case we would receive  subject to certain terms  conditions and potential payment obligations by us  licenses from sanofi aventis to research  develop and commercialize such products 
cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb in december  we entered into a worldwide collaboration with bristol myers squibb for xl and xl upon effectiveness of the agreement in december  bristol myers squibb made an upfront cash payment of million for the development and commercialization rights to both programs 
the agreement required bristol myers squibb to make additional license payments to us of million  which were received during we and bristol myers squibb have agreed to co develop xl  and potentially a backup program for xl the companies will share worldwide except for japan development costs for xl we are responsible for of such costs and bristol myers squibb is responsible for of such costs  except that we are responsible for funding the initial million of combined costs and have the option to defer payments for development costs above certain thresholds 
we expect that we will complete our required funding of the initial million of the combined costs during the first half of fiscal year ending december   after which we will be responsible for of the combined costs going forward 
in return  we will share of the commercial profits and losses including pre launch commercialization expenses in the united states and have the option to co promote xl in the united states 
bristol myers squibb is responsible for all costs intended to support regulatory approval in japan 
we have the right to defer payment for certain early commercialization and other related costs above certain thresholds 
we are eligible to receive sales performance milestones of up to million and double digit royalties on sales on xl outside the united states 
the clinical development of xl is directed by a joint committee 
it is anticipated that we will continue to conduct certain clinical development activities for xl we may opt out of the co development for xl  in which case we would instead be eligible to receive development and regulatory milestones of up to million  double digit royalties on xl product sales worldwide and sales performance milestones 
our co development and co promotion rights may be terminated in the event that we have cash reserves below million and we are unable to increase such cash reserves to million or more within days  in which case we would receive development and regulatory milestones  sales milestones and double digit royalties  instead of sharing product profits on xl in the united states 
for purposes of the agreement  cash reserves includes our total cash  cash equivalents and investments excluding any restricted cash  plus the amount then available for borrowing by us under certain financing arrangements 
our co promotion rights on xl in the united states  and possibly our right to share product profits on xl  may be terminated in the event we undergo certain change of control transactions 
bristol myers squibb may  upon certain prior notice to us  terminate the agreement as to products containing xl or xl in the event of such termination election  bristol myers squibb s license relating to such product would terminate and revert to us  and we would receive  subject to certain terms and conditions  licenses from bristol myers squibb to research  develop and commercialize such products 
bristol myers squibb received an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize xl we will carry out certain clinical trials of xl which may include a backup program on xl bristol myers 
table of contents squibb is responsible for funding all future development of xl  including our activities 
we are eligible for development and regulatory milestones of up to million on xl  sales performance milestones of up to million and double digit royalties on worldwide sales of xl the upfront payment of million we received upon effectiveness of the collaboration agreement and the license payments of million and million that we received in the first quarter and second quarter of  respectively  will be recognized ratably over the estimated development term of five years  and recorded as license revenue  from the effective date of the agreement in december any milestone payments that we may receive under the agreement will be recognized ratably over the same period but will be recorded as contract revenue 
we will record as operating expense of the cost incurred for work performed by us on the two programs 
during the term of the collaboration  so long as we have not opted out of the co development of xl  there may be periods during which bristol myers squibb will partially reimburse us for certain research and development expenses  and other periods during which we will owe bristol myers squibb for research and development expenses that bristol myers squibb incurred on joint development projects  less amounts reimbursable to us by bristol myers squibb on these projects 
to the extent that net research and development funding payments are received from bristol myers squibb  these payments will be presented as collaboration revenue 
in periods when net research and development funding payments are payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments will be presented as collaboration cost sharing expense 
net amounts due from or payable to bristol myers squibb will be determined and reflected on an annual basis 
for the year ending december   we incurred a net payable to bristol myers squibb 
because we are conducting early clinical activity under the collaboration  we expect aggregate collaboration reimbursements during the fiscal year ended december  generally  the direction of cash flows will depend on the level of development activity by either party  which may change during the development term 
our capital requirements will be impacted by the level of our expenses for the development activity conducted by us and the degree to which we will be required to make payments to  or we will receive payments from  bristol myers squibb 
if we opt out of the co development of xl  we would have no further unreimbursed cost obligations with respect to that compound 
march restructuring on march   we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately  or employees 
we anticipate that the actions associated with the restructuring plan will be completed during the restructuring plan is a consequence of our continued strategy to focus resources on the development of our most advanced clinical compounds  xl and xl xl  and ongoing efforts to reduce costs 
we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of related to one time termination benefits 
we expect to incur additional charges as a result of the restructuring plan  including facility related charges  equipment write downs and potentially other charges  and expect to record the majority of these expenses during the fiscal year as they are determined 
we are currently unable to estimate the total amount or range of amounts expected to be incurred in connection with the restructuring plan for each major type of cost or in the aggregate 
we expect that the restructuring plan will result in cash expenditures of approximately million during the first and second quarters of the restructuring charge that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring is subject to a number of assumptions  and actual results may materially differ 
we may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of  or associated with  the restructuring plan 

table of contents glaxosmithkline loan repayment obligations in october  we entered into a collaboration with glaxosmithkline to discover and develop novel therapeutics in the areas of vascular biology  inflammatory disease and oncology 
as part of the collaboration  we entered into a loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  pursuant to which we borrowed million for use in our efforts under the collaboration 
the loan bears interest at a rate of per annum and is secured by certain intellectual property  technology and equipment created or utilized pursuant to the collaboration 
as of december   the aggregate principal and interest outstanding under our glaxosmithkline loan was million  after giving effect to a cash payment we made to glaxosmithkline of million on october  for the first of three annual installments of principal and accrued interest due under the loan 
the second and third installments of principal and accrued interest under the loan are due on october  and october   respectively 
repayment of all or any of the amounts advanced to us under the loan agreement may  at our election  be in the form of our common stock at fair market value  subject to certain conditions  or cash 
following the conclusion on october  of the development term under our collaboration with glaxosmithkline  we are no longer eligible to receive selection milestone payments from glaxosmithkline to credit against outstanding loan amounts  and in the event the market price for our common stock is depressed  we may not be able to repay the loan in full using shares of our common stock due to restrictions in the agreement on the number of shares we may issue 
in addition  the issuance of shares of our common stock to repay the loan may result in significant dilution to our stockholders 
as a result  we may need to obtain additional funding to satisfy our repayment obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to repay amounts outstanding under the loan when due or that we will satisfy the conditions to our ability to repay the loan in shares of our common stock 
during  we may pursue a potential refinancing of the glaxosmithkline loan with a third party  although there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all 
deerfield facility on june   we entered into a facility agreement with deerfield private design fund  lp  deerfield private design international  lp  deerfield partners  lp and deerfield international limited  or the deerfield entities  pursuant to which the deerfield entities agreed to loan to us up to million 
we had the right to draw down on the loan facility through december   with any amounts drawn being due on june  the facility agreement was terminated in november as a result of the termination  we incurred a million charge to interest expense relating to the write off of deferred financing costs 
we did not draw on the facility agreement at any time prior to its termination 
pursuant to the facility agreement  we paid the deerfield entities a one time transaction fee of million  or of the loan facility 
in addition  we were obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of million  that was payable quarterly and was recognized as interest expense as incurred 
pursuant to the facility agreement  we issued six year warrants to the deerfield entities to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
symphony evolution  inc in  we licensed three of our compounds  xl  xl and xl  to symphony evolution  inc  or sei  in return for an million investment for the clinical development of these compounds 
as part of the agreement  we received an exclusive purchase option to acquire all of the equity of sei  thereby allowing us to reacquire xl  xl and xl at our sole discretion 
the purchase option price  which could be paid in cash and or shares of our common stock  at our sole discretion  was equal to the sum of the total amount of capital invested in sei by its investors million and an amount equal to per year on such funded capital  compounded from the time of funding 
the purchase option expired on june  as a result of the expiration of the purchase option  we issued a warrant to symphony evolution holdings llc  the parent company of sei  with a five year term to purchase 
table of contents  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which was equal to of the average closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market over a continuous period of trading days immediately preceding the second trading day prior to the business day immediately following the date the purchase option expired 
the expiration of the purchase option triggered a reconsideration event regarding our need to consolidate sei  a variable interest entity 
upon the expiration of the purchase option  we no longer held a variable interest in the variable interest entity 
accordingly  we deconsolidated sei and derecognized the sei assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest from our financial statements 
in the second quarter of  we recognized a loss of million upon the deconsolidation of the variable interest entity 
for the period prior to the expiration of the purchase option  we concluded that sei was a variable interest entity for which we were the primary beneficiary 
as a result  we included the financial condition and results of operations of sei in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we had deducted the losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest in sei from our net loss in the consolidated statement of operations and we also reduced the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interest in sei in the consolidated balance sheet by sei s losses 
the noncontrolling interest holders ownership in the consolidated balance sheet was million as of december  prior to  we would not allocate losses to the noncontrolling interest in sei such that the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest would be reduced below zero 
however  with the adoption of updated reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal year  we would allocate losses to the noncontrolling interest in sei such that the noncontrolling interest could have a negative carrying value 
for the years ended december   and  the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders were million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and related notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  which require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are derived from three primary sources license fees  milestone payments and collaborative agreement reimbursements 
revenues from license fees and milestone payments primarily consist of up front license fees and milestone payments received under various collaboration agreements 
we initially recognize upfront fees received from third party collaborators as unearned revenue and then recognize these amounts on a ratable basis over the expected term of the research collaboration 
often  the total research term is not contractually defined and an 
table of contents estimate of the term of our total obligation must be made 
for example  under the cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb  we have estimated our term to be five years  or through the completion of phase trials 
we estimate that this is the longest possible period that we could be obligated to perform services and therefore the appropriate term with which to amortize any license fees 
however  if we submit an nda earlier than anticipated  or bristol myers squibb decides to take over management of trials prior to their completion  the estimated term of our obligation would be shortened  resulting in an increase in revenue recognition in the period in which our estimated term changes 
license fees are classified as license revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
although milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the expected research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of a milestone being recognized on the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenue 
other companies have adopted an alternative milestone revenue recognition policy  whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by a material amount compared to total revenue recognized 
in certain situations  we may receive milestone payments after the end of our period of continued involvement 
in such circumstances  we would recognize of the milestone revenue when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are classified as contract revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
collaborative agreement reimbursement revenue consists of research and development support received from collaborators 
collaborative agreement reimbursement revenue is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements by both parties under the respective contracts 
under the cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb  certain research and development expenses are partially reimbursable to us 
on an annual basis  the amounts that bristol myers squibb owes us  net of amounts reimbursable to bristol myers squibb by us on those projects  are recorded as revenue 
conversely  research and development expenses may include the net settlement of amounts we owe bristol myers squibb for research and development expenses that bristol myers squibb incurred on joint development projects  less amounts reimbursable to us by bristol myers squibb on these projects 
in annual periods when net research and development funding payments are payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments will be presented as collaboration cost sharing expense 
agreement reimbursements are classified as either contract revenue or collaboration reimbursements in our consolidated statement of operations  depending on the terms of the agreement 
some of our research and licensing arrangements have multiple deliverables in order to meet our customer s needs 
for example  the arrangements may include a combination of intellectual property rights and research and development services 
multiple element revenue agreements are evaluated to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
generally  the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the final deliverable is followed for the combined unit of accounting 
for certain arrangements  the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined 
accordingly  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
in  under our collaboration with glaxosmithkline  we accelerated million in previously deferred revenue as a result of the development term concluding on the earliest scheduled end date of october   instead of the previously estimated end date of october  clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
we accrue expenses for preclinical studies 
table of contents performed by our vendors based on certain estimates over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates as required 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites  and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the study 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with cros and review of contractual terms 
we base our estimates on the best information available at the time 
however  additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods 
in this event  we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain 
such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first known 
stock option valuation our estimate of compensation expense requires us to determine the appropriate fair value model and a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
we have limited historical information available to support the underlying estimates of certain assumptions required to value stock options 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
because there is a market for options on our common stock  we have considered implied volatilities as well as our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation

these increases in revenue were partially offset by decreases in milestone and contract revenue relating to the conclusion of certain collaborations with glaxosmithkline  genentech and bristol myers squibb  in addition to a decline in research and development funding relating to fewer full time equivalent employees under our lxr program with bristol myers squibb 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to increased milestone revenues associated with two million milestones achieved with respect to xl and xl under our cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb 
in addition  we accelerated million in deferred revenues under our collaboration with glaxosmithkline  for which the development term concluded on october  in prior years  revenues from upfront payments  premiums paid on equity purchases and milestones had been recognized assuming that the development term would be extended through the longest contractual period of october  however  as a result of the development term concluding on the earliest scheduled end date under the 
table of contents collaboration  the remaining deferred revenues was recognized through october  these increases were partly offset by decreases of million in revenue associated with the sale of our former subsidiary artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh  or artemis  which was no longer consolidated as a result of the sale of of our ownership in prior to the closing of the sale of of the share capital of artemis on november   we had included the revenues attributable to artemis for within our consolidated total revenues 
as a result of the sale  artemis financial results are no longer consolidated into our consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  research and development expenses dollar decrease increase percentage decrease increase research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  clinical trials and consulting  laboratory supplies and facility costs 
the change in compared to resulted primarily from the following clinical trials clinical trial expenses  which include services performed by third party contract research organizations and other vendors  decreased by million  or  primarily due to the wind down of activities associated with xl  xl  xl and xl clinical trials  the transfer of xl to glaxosmithkline in  the transfer of xl to genentech in march  and non clinical toxicology studies conducted in on xl these decreases were partially offset by an increase in phase and phase clinical trial activities for xl  ind activity for xl  increased phase clinical trial activity for xl and increased phase clinical trial activity related to xl  xl and xl personnel personnel expense  which includes salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs  decreased by million  or  primarily due to a reduction in headcount related to our restructuring in november laboratory supplies laboratory supplies decreased by million  or  primarily due to the decrease in headcount and other cost cutting measures 
cost reimbursement primarily as a result of our contract research agreement with agrigenetics  inc  or agrigenetics  we received an increase in research and development funding of million that was recognized as a reduction to research and development expense 
the change in compared to resulted primarily from the following clinical trials clinical trial expenses  which include services performed by third party contract research organizations and other vendors  increased by million  or  primarily due to activities for a phase clinical trial for xl  phase clinical trial activity for xl  xl and xl  additional phase clinical trial activity for xl  xl  xl and xl  and preclinical studies for xl and xl the increase was also due in part to start up activities for a phase clinical trial of xl that we subsequently decided not to initiate 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in expense associated with xl and xl phase clinical trial activities  a decline in expense associated with xl for non clinical toxicology studies performed in and a decline in expenses related to xl due to the selection of xl by glaxosmithkline in march under our product development and commercialization agreement 
general corporate costs there was an increase of million  or  in the allocation of general corporate costs such as facilities costs  property taxes and insurance to research and development  
table of contents which primarily reflected the relative growth of the research and development function compared to the general and administrative function 
personnel personnel expense  which includes salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  temporaries  recruiting and relocation costs  increased by million  or  primarily due to the expanded workforce supporting drug development operations to advance our clinical and preclinical development programs 
laboratory supplies laboratory supplies expense decreased by million  or  primarily due to cost savings measures implemented during we do not track total research and development expenses separately for each of our research and development programs 
we group our research and development expenses into three categories drug discovery  development and other 
our drug discovery group utilizes a variety of high throughput technologies to enable the rapid discovery  optimization and extensive characterization of lead compounds such that we are able to select development candidates with the best potential for further evaluation and advancement into clinical development 
drug discovery expenses relate primarily to personnel expense  lab supplies and general corporate costs 
our development group leads the development and implementation of our clinical and regulatory strategies and prioritizes disease indications in which our compounds may be studied in clinical trials 
development expenses relate primarily to clinical trial  personnel and general corporate costs 
the other category primarily includes stock compensation expense 
in addition to reviewing the three categories of research and development expenses described above  we principally consider qualitative factors in making decisions regarding our research and development programs 
such factors include enrollment in clinical trials for our drug candidates  the results of and data from clinical trials  the potential indications for our drug candidates  the therapeutic and commercial potential for our drug candidates and competitive dynamics 
we also make our research and development decisions in the context of our overall business strategy  which includes the pursuit of commercial collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development of our drug candidates 
the expenditures summarized in the following table reflect total research and development expenses by category  including allocations for general and administrative expense dollar amounts are presented in millions inception to date drug discovery development other total inception is as of january   the date on which we began tracking research and development expenses by category 
while we do not track total research and development expenses separately for each program  beginning in fiscal  we began tracking third party expenditures directly relating to each program as a way of monitoring external costs 
our third party research and development expenditures relate principally to our clinical trial and related development activities  such as preclinical and clinical studies and contract manufacturing  and represent only a portion of the costs related to each program 
third party expenditures for programs initiated prior to the beginning of fiscal have not been tracked from project inception  and therefore such expenditures from the actual inception for most of our programs are not available 
we do not accumulate on a program specific basis internal research and development expenses  such as salaries and personnel expenses  facilities overhead expenses and external costs not directly attributable to a specific project 
nevertheless  we believe that third party expenditures by program provide a reasonable estimate of the percentage of our total research and development 
table of contents expenses that are attributable to each such program 
for the full year  the programs representing the greatest portion of our external third party research and development expenditures were xl  xl  xl  xl and xl 
the expenses for these programs were primarily included in the development category of our research and development expenses and exclude the impact of any amounts reimbursed by our partners 
we currently do not have reliable estimates regarding the timing of our clinical trials 
we currently estimate that typical phase clinical trials last approximately one year  phase clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase clinical trials last approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
in general  we will incur increased research and development expenses for compounds that advance in clinical development  whereas expenses will end for compounds that do not warrant further clinical development 
we currently do not have reliable estimates of total costs for a particular drug candidate to reach the market 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and may not result in receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  general and administrative expenses dollar decrease increase percentage decrease increase general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  employee stock based compensation expense  facility costs and consulting and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting fees 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a reduction in headcount related to our restructuring in november  reduced consulting and outside service costs  and other cost saving measures 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in rent and other facilities costs associated with our property 
the decrease in from resulted primarily from an increase of million in the allocation of general corporate costs such as facilities costs  property taxes and insurance to research and development  which primarily reflected the relative growth of the research and development function compared to the general and administrative function 
this decrease was partly offset by increases in facilities costs of million and consulting and outside services costs of million 
collaboration cost sharing expenses reimbursements total collaboration cost sharing expenses were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  collaboration cost sharing expenses reimbursements dollar change percentage change not meaningful not meaningful 
table of contents total collaboration cost sharing expenses consist of research and development expenses and reimbursements related to our cancer collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for xl and xl to the extent that net annual research and development funding payments are received from bristol myers squibb  these payments will be presented as collaboration reimbursement 
in years when net research and development funding payments are payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments will be presented as collaboration cost sharing expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net payable to bristol myers squibb  resulting with an increase in operating expenses of million 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net receivable from bristol myers squibb of million  which was included in total revenues 
amortization of intangible assets total amortization of intangible assets was as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  amortization of intangible assets dollar decrease percentage decrease intangible assets resulted from our acquisitions of x ceptor therapeutics  genomica  artemis and agritope renamed exelixis plant sciences 
these assets were amortized over specified time periods 
there was no amortization of intangible assets in or the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense in compared to was due to the completion of the amortization of the assembled workforce related to our acquisition of x ceptor therapeutics 
in addition  amortization of intangible assets expense decreased as a result of our transaction in september with agrigenetics in which we sold million of acquired patents and our transaction in november in which we sold of the share capital of artemis  which included million of acquired patents 
restructuring charge in november  we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction in force of employees  or approximately of our workforce 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of consisting primarily of severance  health care benefits and legal and outplacement services fees 
the balance of the liability was included in other accrued expenses on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december  and was fully paid out as of december  all actions associated with the restructuring plan were completed in the first quarter of  and we do not anticipate incurring any further costs under the restructuring plan

table of contents the change in total other income expense  net for compared to resulted primarily from the recording of a million loss upon deconsolidation of sei as a result of the expiration of our purchase option for sei in june and million in interest expense relating to the termination of the deerfield credit facility in december lower interest rates led to a decline in interest income of million and we also recorded a net adjustment of million to the gain on the sale of our plant trait business  and artemis which represents the difference between the million recorded in and the million recorded in the decrease in total other income expense  net for compared to was primarily due to the gain on the sale of our plant trait business and the gain on sale of of the share capital of artemis  and a decrease in interest income as a result of lower cash and investment balances and lower average interest rates 
in september  we sold our plant trait business to agrigenetics  and  as a result  we recognized in a gain of million in total other income 
the gain of million primarily consisted of a purchase price of million  less million in net book value of tangible and intangible assets and the derecognition of million of goodwill 
as a result of the sale of of the share capital of artemis in november  we recognized in a gain of million in total other income 
this gain primarily consisted of cash received of million  plus million relating to the elimination of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and the elimination of net liabilities  less million of intangible assets acquired patents and the derecognition of million of goodwill 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit for was the result of a million tax credit recorded as a result of the housing and economic recovery act of during the third quarter of  we recorded a tax provision as a result of million of withholding tax associated with the million of upfront payments received from sanofi aventis during the quarter 
however  in december  the united states senate ratified the protocol  originally signed on january  to the convention between the government of the united states of america and the government of the french republic for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital  thereby eliminating this withholding tax  resulting in us reversing the provision in december and booking a receivable from the french government 
under the internal revenue code and similar state provisions  certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they are used 
loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in  we licensed three of our compounds  xl  xl and xl  to sei in return for an million investment for the clinical development of these compounds 
as part of the agreement  we received an exclusive purchase option to acquire all of the equity of sei  thereby allowing us to reacquire xl  xl and xl at our sole discretion 
the purchase option expired on june  the expiration of the purchase option triggered a reconsideration event regarding our need to consolidate sei  a variable interest entity 
upon the expiration of the purchase option  we no longer held a variable interest in the variable interest entity 
accordingly  we deconsolidated sei and derecognized the sei assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest from our financial statements 
for the years ended december   and  the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders were million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents the decrease in from in the losses attributable to noncontrolling interest holders were due to the deconsolidation of sei in june the decrease in from in the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders was primarily due to decreased development expenses associated with xl and xl liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended december   and dollar amounts are presented in thousands year ended december  consolidated net loss adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  at end of year to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity  payments and loans from collaborators  equipment financing facilities and interest income 
we also financed certain of our research and development activities under our agreements with sei 
in september  we received net proceeds  after underwriting fees and offering expenses  of million from the sale of million shares of our common stock under a shelf registration statement 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  which included restricted cash and investments of million 
in addition  as of december   approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities served as collateral for bank lines of credit 
operating activities our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for cash used in operating activities during related primarily to our consolidated net loss of million offset by increases in deferred revenues and other non cash charges 
the decrease in our consolidated net loss was driven by an increase in revenues primarily due to our collaboration with sanofi aventis relating to xl and xl and our cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb relating to xl and xl in addition to an overall decrease in operating expenses 
these uses of cash were primarily offset by a net increase in deferred revenue of million  primarily driven by receipt of an upfront cash payment of million related to the global license agreement and collaboration with sanofi aventis  partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue from the ratable recognition of deferred revenues over the period of continuing involvement from our various collaborations 
in addition  cash uses were offset by non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  and a million loss that we recorded upon deconsolidation of sei 

table of contents cash used in operating activities during related primarily to our consolidated net loss of million 
the increase in our net loss was primarily driven by the continued advancement and expansion of our clinical trial activity in addition to the inclusion in of the million gain on the sale of assets recognized in conjunction with our transaction with agrigenetics  which was accounted for as a sale of our plant trait business  and million gain on the sale of of artemis 
these uses of cash were primarily offset by a net increase in deferred revenue of million primarily driven by receipt of an upfront cash payment of million related to the xl and xl collaboration with bristol myers squibb  partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue from the ratable recognition of deferred revenues over the period of continuing involvement from our various collaborations 
in particular  we accelerated million in previously deferred revenue relating to the conclusion of our collaboration with glaxosmithkline  the development term for which concluded on october  in addition  cash uses were offset by increases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses as well as non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
while cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our consolidated net loss  operating cash flows differ from our consolidated net loss as a result of differences in the timing of cash receipts and earnings recognition and non cash charges 
we expect to use cash for operating activities for at least the next several years as we continue to incur net losses associated with our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million for and cash used of million for cash used in investing activities for was primarily driven by purchases of marketable securities of million 
most of the cash invested in marketable securities was generated by payments received from collaborators 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and on sales of investments held by sei  for a combined cash inflow of million used to fund our operations 
cash provided in investing activities for was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale and maturities of marketable securities of million and the sale of million of investments held by sei  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
in addition  in september we received the million anniversary payment plus an additional million of contingent consideration in association with our transaction with agrigenetics 
the proceeds provided by maturities or sale of our marketable securities and the sale of investments by sei were used to fund our operations 
we expect to continue to make moderate investments in property and equipment to support our operations 
cash used in investing activities for was primarily driven by net purchases of marketable securities of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
most of the cash invested in marketable securities and investments was generated by a common stock offering in and payments received from collaborators 
these uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of our plant trait business and artemis

financing activities our financing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million for and million for 
table of contents cash used by our financing activities for was primarily due to principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million partially offset by proceeds from notes payable and bank obligations of million and proceeds from employee stock purchase plan purchases of million 
in line with our focus on managing our cash resources  purchase of property and equipment were significantly lower in than compared to prior years 
cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily due to proceeds of million from our notes payable and bank obligations and million from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
these increases were partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million 
cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily due to net proceeds of million received through the sale of our common stock and million of proceeds from note payable and bank obligations 
these increases were partially offset by million of principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations 
we finance property and equipment purchases through equipment financing facilities  such as notes and bank obligations 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities and other general corporate purposes 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on notes  bank obligations and our loan from glaxosmithkline 
in june  we entered into the facility agreement with the deerfield entities for which the deerfield entities agreed to loan us up to million  subject to certain conditions 
the facility agreement was terminated in november  resulting in a million charge to interest expense relating to a cancellation fee and outstanding warrants 
we did not draw on the facility agreement at any time prior to its termination 
cash requirements we have incurred net losses since inception  including a net loss attributable to exelixis  inc of million for the year ended december  we expect our net loss in to increase compared to and anticipate negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities  which included restricted cash and investments of million 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities and funding that we expect to receive from collaborators  which includes anticipated cash from additional business development activity  will enable us to maintain our operations  after giving effect to the restructuring we implemented on march   for a period of at least months following the filing date of this report 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors that may require us to use available capital resources significantly earlier than we currently anticipate 
these factors include repayment of our loan from glaxosmithkline in october  we entered into a collaboration with glaxosmithkline  to discover and develop novel therapeutics in the areas of vascular biology  inflammatory disease and oncology 
as part of the collaboration  we entered into a loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  pursuant to which we borrowed million for use in our efforts under the collaboration 
the loan bears interest at a rate of per annum and is secured by certain intellectual property  technology and equipment created or utilized pursuant to the collaboration 
as of december   the aggregate principal and interest outstanding under our glaxosmithkline loan was million  after giving effect to a cash payment we made to glaxosmithkline of million on october  for the first of three annual installments of principal and accrued interest due under the loan 
the second and third installments of principal and accrued interest under the loan are due on october  and october   respectively 
repayment of all or any of the amounts advanced to us under the loan agreement may  at our election  be in the form of our common stock at fair market value  subject to certain conditions  or cash 
following the conclusion on october  of the development term under our collaboration with glaxosmithkline  we are no longer eligible to 
table of contents receive selection milestone payments from glaxosmithkline to credit against outstanding loan amounts  and in the event the market price for our common stock is depressed  we may not be able to repay the loan in full using shares of our common stock due to restrictions in the agreement on the number of shares we may issue 
in addition  the issuance of shares of our common stock to repay the loan may result in significant dilution to our stockholders 
as a result  we may need to obtain additional funding to satisfy our repayment obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to repay amounts outstanding under the loan when due or that we will satisfy the conditions to our ability to repay the loan in shares of our common stock 
during  we may pursue a potential refinancing of the glaxosmithkline loan with a third party  although there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all  the progress and scope of the development activity with respect to xl  our most advanced compound we are focusing our development efforts on xl  which is being studied in a variety of tumor types  with the goal of rapidly commercializing the compound 
as described under item of this report under business corporate collaborations bristol myers squibb cancer collaboration in december  we entered into a worldwide co development collaboration with bristol myers squibb for the development and commercialization of xl the companies will share worldwide except for japan development costs for xl we are responsible for of such costs and bristol myers squibb is responsible for of such costs  except that we are responsible for funding the initial million of combined costs and have the option to defer payments for development costs above certain thresholds 
in return  we will share of the commercial profits and losses including pre launch commercialization expenses in the united states and have the option to co promote xl in the united states 
bristol myers squibb is responsible for all costs intended to support regulatory approval in japan 
we have the right to defer payment for certain early commercialization and other related costs above certain thresholds 
during the term of the collaboration  so long as we have not opted out of the co development of xl  there may be periods during which bristol myers squibb will partially reimburse us for certain research and development expenses  and other periods during which we will owe bristol myers squibb for research and development expenses that bristol myers squibb incurred on joint development projects  less amounts reimbursable to us by bristol myers squibb on these projects 
on an annual basis  to the extent that net research and development funding payments are received from bristol myers squibb  these payments will be presented as collaboration revenue 
in annual periods when net research and development funding payments are payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments will be presented as collaboration cost sharing expense 
generally  the direction of cash flows will depend on the level of development activity by either party  which may change during the development term 
our capital requirements will be impacted by the level of our expenses for the development activity conducted by us and the degree to which we will be required to make payments to  or we will receive payments from  bristol myers squibb 
if we opt out of the co development of xl  we would have no further unreimbursed cost obligations for that compound  the progress and scope of other research and development activities conducted by us  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the degree to which we conduct funded development activity on behalf of partners to whom we have out licensed compounds  our ability to enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements that provide additional payments  our ability to control costs  our ability to remain in compliance with  or amend or cause to be waived  financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties  
table of contents the amount of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that serve as collateral for bank lines of credit  future clinical trial results  our need to expand our product and clinical development efforts  our ability to share the costs of our clinical development efforts with third parties  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of clinical and research supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the cost of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products and technologies 
one or more of these factors or changes to our current operating plan may require us to use available capital resources significantly earlier than we anticipate 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we may seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through external borrowings 
in addition  we may enter into additional strategic partnerships or collaborative arrangements for the development and commercialization of our compounds 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness  and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
we may need to obtain additional funding in order to stay in compliance with financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties 
for example  our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline contains financial covenants pursuant to which our working capital the amount by which our current assets exceed our current liabilities as defined by the agreement  which excludes restricted cash and deferred revenue must not be less than million and our cash and investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments as defined by the agreement  which excludes restricted cash must not be less than million 
as of december   our working capital was million and our cash and investments were million 
if we default on the financial covenants under the loan and security agreement  glaxosmithkline may  among other remedies  declare immediately due and payable all obligations under the loan and security agreement 
outstanding borrowings and accrued interest under the loan and security agreement totaled million at december  the second and third installments of principal and accrued interest under the loan are due on october  and october   respectively 
in addition  if our cash reserves fall below million and we are unable to increase such cash reserves to million or more within days  our co development and co promotion rights with respect to xl under our collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb may be terminated 
cash reserves for purposes of our collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb includes our total cash  cash equivalents and investments excluding any restricted cash  plus the amount then available for borrowing by us under certain financing arrangements 
if we cannot raise additional capital in order to remain in compliance with our financial covenants or if we are unable to renegotiate such covenants and the lender exercises its remedies under the agreement  we would not be able to operate under our current operating plan 

table of contents we have contractual obligations in the form of operating leases  notes payable and licensing agreements 
the following chart details our contractual obligations as of december  dollar amounts are presented in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years notes payable and bank obligations other obligations convertible loans operating leases total contractual cash obligations includes interest payable on convertible loans of million as of december  additional interest accrues at per annum 
the debt and interest payable can be repaid in cash or common stock at our election 
the development term under our collaboration with glaxosmithkline concluded on october  we paid the first of three annual payments of principal plus accrued interest of million in october the remaining two payments of principal and accrued interest will be due in october and excluded from the table above are obligations under our collaboration agreements with bristol myers squibb to co develop and co commercialize xl  xl and xl in the united states

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
this update provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific or third party evidence is available 
we expect to adopt this guidance prospectively from january  we are assessing the impact of this guidance on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash and investments of million  and at december   we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  investments held by sei and restricted cash and investments of million 
our marketable securities and investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
by policy  we limit our investments to money market instruments  debt securities of us government agencies and debt obligations of us corporations 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated income taxes 
we manage market risk through diversification requirements mandated by our investment policy  which limits the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we manage credit risk by limiting our purchases to high quality issuers 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
at december  and  we had debt outstanding of million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments or a combination thereof 
the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and as of december  and  a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we have assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from our estimate
