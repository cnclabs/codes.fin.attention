company overview we have been purchasing and collecting charged off accounts receivable portfolios from consumer credit originators since the formation of our predecessor company in charged off receivables are the unpaid obligations of individuals to credit originators  such as credit card issuers including private label card issuers  consumer finance companies  healthcare providers  telecommunications and utility providers 
since these receivables are delinquent or past due  we purchase them at a substantial discount 
over the last ten years  we purchased  consumer debt portfolios  with an original charged off face value of billion for an aggregate purchase price of million  or of face value  net of buybacks 
we purchase and collect charged off consumer receivable portfolios for our own account as we believe this affords us the best opportunity to use long term strategies to maximize our profits 
macro economic factors over the past year have influenced us both positively and negatively 
macro economic factors such as reduced availability of credit for consumers  falling residential real estate values  elevated unemployment rates  low consumer confidence and other factors have had a negative impact on us by making it more difficult to collect from consumers on the charged off accounts receivable portfolios paper we have acquired 
conversely  as a result of these negative macro economic factors  the supply of available paper has increased while prices we pay for that paper have declined 
total cash collections during did not meet our expectations  particularly on our older vintages of paper and were below cash collections in and we believe the decline in cash collections was caused by negative macro economic factors and amplified by our strategy to decrease purchasing in the first half of to save resources and build capacity to purchase paper in the second half of the year 
we reduced purchasing in the first half of in anticipation of increased supply and therefore lower prices in the second half of the year which we expected to generate better returns than if we had invested the same amounts earlier 
however  by following this strategy  we generated lower cash collections on investments in purchased receivables than if we had invested more in paper earlier in the year 
the economy is not expected to dramatically improve in the near term  as a result we expect the collections environment to continue to be difficult in we generally account for our revenues on our purchased receivables by using the interest method of accounting interest method in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to make reasonable estimates of the timing and amount of future cash collections 
we use the cost recovery method when collections on a particular portfolio cannot be reasonably predicted 
the estimates used in the interest method to calculate the projected internal rate of return irr on our portfolios are primarily based on historical cash collections and payer dynamics 
we recognized a significant loss in the fourth quarter and for the full year the loss resulted primarily from the recognition of significant impairments on our purchased receivables 
impairments are generated when yields assigned to portfolios under the interest method of accounting are too high in relation to the timing and or amount of current or estimated future collections 
the difficult macro economic environment has resulted in reduced cash collections particularly on the and older 
table of contents vintages of paper  relative to our collection forecasts used for revenue recognition purposes 
collection expectations on these older vintages were set and sometimes increased while operating in a better economic environment 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter and year ended december   we observed a significant difference between our estimated and actual cash collections  which caused us to perform a more in depth review of our portfolios and their expected future performance 
since we expect continued pressure on cash collections relative to expectations given the challenging macro economic environment and the age of this paper  we discounted our expectation of future cash collections on the vintages of paper by million and recognized significant impairments to the carrying value as a result of this change in estimate 
the discounted collections forecast  along with other impairments  resulted in the recognition of net impairments of million and million during the fourth quarter and full year of  respectively 
we amended our credit agreement during the fourth quarter of the amendment included an increase in average interest rates and adjustments to the financial covenants  which we expected to provide additional borrowing capacity compared to the previous terms of the agreement 
however  with the significant net loss recognized in the fourth quarter and for the full year of we will have limited borrowing capacity under the adjusted financial covenants 
we believe however  that we have sufficient capacity in our credit agreement when combined with anticipated cash flows from operations to fund investments in purchased receivables at or above historical levels 
net losses in future periods however  could further limit our ability to borrow against the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the most restrictive financial covenant is the ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth  as defined  which restricts additional borrowings on the revolving credit facility to approximately an additional million 
our results are influenced by certain industry and economic trends  including levels of consumer debt obligations according to the us federal reserve board  the amount of outstanding revolving and non revolving consumer credit was trillion in december high levels of consumer debt obligations could indicate an increase in future charges offs and increased supply of paper for us 
although  tightening credit standards or other factors in the future may result in lower consumer credit outstanding 
charge off rates according to the us federal reserve board for the third quarter of  the charge off rate  the rate at which accounts are charged off measured as a percentage of total debt outstanding  has increased each quarter during  indicating that the favorable supply environment for debt purchasers is likely to continue 
supply and pricing environment for purchased receivables the supply of purchased receivables is influenced by the levels of consumer debt obligations and charge off rates 
prices for charged off receivables have generally been decreasing since mid impact of macro economic factors macro economic factors affect consumer s ability to satisfy outstanding debt 
the residential real estate market in the united states began to experience a significant downturn in the second half of and real estate values generally remained depressed during the unemployment rate and the number of individual bankruptcy filings remained elevated during  leaving individual consumers with less resources available to satisfy their debt and resulting in a more challenging collection environment 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues and as a percentage of cash collections for the periods indicated percent of total revenues percent of cash collections years ended december  years ended december  revenues purchased receivable revenues gain on sale of purchased receivables other revenues total revenues expenses salaries and benefits collections expense occupancy administrative restructuring charges depreciation and amortization impairment of assets loss on disposal of equipment and other assets total operating expense loss income from operations other income expense interest expense interest income other loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from our main line of business  the purchase and collection of charged off consumer receivables 
we refer to revenue generated from this line of business as purchased receivable revenues 
purchased receivable revenues is the difference between cash collections and amortization of purchased receivables 
the following table summarizes our purchased receivable revenues including cash collections and amortization years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change cash collections purchased receivable amortization purchased receivable revenues 
table of contents the decrease in purchased receivable revenues is the result of lower cash collections and higher amortization  including net impairments  in compared to we believe that the lower cash collections is primarily a result of macro economic factors affecting consumers liquidity and their ability to repay their obligations 
macro economic factors reducing consumers ability to pay include the unemployment rate  which increased from at december to at december  falling residential real estate values and a tighter credit environment for consumers  among other factors 
in addition  we reduced purchasing in the first half of in anticipation of increased supply and therefore lower prices in the second half of the year 
we purchased over of our receivables during in the second half of the year  including of our total purchases in the fourth quarter alone 
by following this strategy  we generated lower cash collections on investments in purchased receivables than if we had invested more in paper earlier in the year 
cash collections for the years ended december  and include collections from fully amortized portfolios of million and million  respectively  of which were reported as revenue 
in addition  our portfolios become more difficult to collect as they age  and we expect that performance on our older vintages  particularly and earlier  will not recover from the current economic downturn 
we expect the macro economic environment to continue to negatively affect collections during the increase in amortization of purchased receivables in compared to is primarily the result of a million increase in net impairments  partially offset by lower amortization of purchased receivables balances caused by lower collections 
recently  we have experienced shortfalls in our actual cash collections versus our expectations  most notably on purchases made before we believe collections on these older vintages have been impacted to a greater extent by the challenging collections environment and because the accounts are older and the collection methods that we use often become less effective as accounts age 
we continually review a number of factors related to our forecast of cash collections 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter and year ended december   we observed a significant difference between our estimated and actual cash collections  which caused us to perform a more in depth review of our portfolios and their expected future performance 
based on our review  we now expect these older vintages to continue to underperform our previous collections forecasts 
this reduction in future expectations of cash collections on the vintages resulted in an impairment of million during the fourth quarter of total net impairments recognized in were million compared to million for we believe that the discount we applied to the estimated remaining collections on the vintages  should reduce the magnitude of impairments resulting from the economic downturn recognized on those vintages in the future 
the and later paper is not experiencing the same magnitude decline in collections as compared to expectations  generally because the initial expectations for these purchases were set at lower levels commensurate with the economic downturn in existence at the time of those purchases 
we expect to continue to set more conservative initial expectations on purchases in the near future as we recover from the economic downturn 
purchased receivable revenues fluctuate based on changes in the balance of purchased receivables  the irr applied to each portfolio and the amount of net impairments recognized 
impairments are generated when current yields assigned to portfolios are too high in relation to the timing and or amount of current or future collections 
when cash collections decline a larger portion of collections is allocated to revenue and less is allocated to amortization of portfolio balances 
portfolio balances that amortize too slowly in relation to current or expected collections lead to impairments  which increase the amount of amortization and offset revenue 
the amortization rate of for increased percentage points from the amortization rate of for we are experiencing lower collection rates relative to purchase price than we have historically for all vintage years 
the economic downturn has lowered the amounts that we collect on our investments in purchased receivables  and combined with higher prices on the older vintages due to increased competition during the timeframe  is causing an increase in total amortization as a percentage of cash collection 

table of contents refer to supplemental performance data on page for a summary of purchased receivable revenues and amortization rates by year of purchase 
revenues on portfolios purchased from our top three sellers during vintage years through were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  with one of the three sellers included in the top three in both twelve month periods 
investments in purchased receivables we generate revenue from our investments in portfolios of charged off consumer accounts receivable 
ongoing investments in purchased receivables are critical to continued generation of revenues 
from period to period  we may buy charged off receivables of varying age  types and demographics 
as a result  the cost of our purchases  as a percent of face value  may fluctuate from one period to the next 
total purchases consisted of the following years ended december  in millions  net of buybacks change percent acquisitions of purchased receivables at cost acquisitions of purchased receivables at face value percentage of face value our investment in purchased receivables declined in versus because of our strategy to defer purchasing into the latter part of the year with the expectation that pricing would continue to improve and that our investments would generate better returns if we purchased at lower price points by waiting 
additionally  we were cautious in our investments because borrowing under our credit facility to fund investments in purchased receivables was potentially limited by our then existing financial covenants that had scheduled step downs during we considered amending the credit facility to create additional capacity to purchase in late and the first half of  but the credit markets were under substantial disruption which made it difficult to justify amending the credit facility given the anticipated additional cost  both up front and ongoing 
during the fourth quarter of  the credit markets were more stable allowing us to amend the credit facility under more favorable terms than if we had amended it before then 
the amendment increased the interest rates we pay and adjusted the financial covenants 
investments under forward flow contracts forward flow contracts commit a debt seller to sell a steady flow of charged off receivables to us  and commit us to purchase receivables for a fixed percentage of the face value 
forward flow contracts may be attractive to us because they provide operational advantages from the consistent amount and type of accounts acquired 
forward flow purchases consisted of the following years ended december  in millions  net of buybacks change percent forward flow purchases  at cost forward flow purchases  at face value percentage of face value percentage of forward flow purchases  at cost of total purchasing percentage of forward flow purchases  at face value of total purchasing investments in forward flow contracts declined in from in substantially the same proportion as our total purchases declined for the same period 
because we expected pricing to decline during  we were selective in entering into forward flow commitments during the early part of the year so that we weren t locked into above market pricing later in the year 
additionally  since some forward flow contracts are of a twelve 
table of contents month duration and we did not commit early in the year  we lost the opportunity to invest in these contracts during the latter part of purchases from forward flows in included portfolios from forward flow contracts 
purchases from forward flows in included portfolios from forward flow contracts 
operating expenses operating expenses are traditionally measured in relation to revenues 
however  we measure operating expenses in relation to cash collections 
we believe this is appropriate because amortization rates  the difference between cash collections and revenues recognized  vary from year to year 
amortization rates vary due to seasonality of collections  impairments and other factors and can distort the analysis of operating expenses when measured against revenues 
additionally  we believe that the majority of our operating expenses are variable in relation to cash collections 
the following table summarizes the significant components of our operating expenses years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change salaries and benefits collections expense occupancy administrative other total operating expenses the majority of the decrease in operating expenses is a result of reductions in salaries and benefits  collections expense and administrative expenses 
as we experienced year over year declines in cash collections  we reduced operating expenses to reflect the lower levels of cash collections 
while the dollar amount of operating expenses declined  some categories of operating expenses increased as a percentage of cash collections because the decline in cash collections was greater than the decline in operating expenses 
we did not reduce operating expenses proportionately to the decline in cash collections in anticipation of increased purchasing in the second half of and into salaries and benefits 
salaries and benefits expense decreased because of lower variable incentive compensation and benefits driven by lower cash collections 
the following table summarizes the significant components of our salaries and benefits expense years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change compensation revenue generating compensation administrative benefits and other total salaries and benefits the decrease in collections resulted in lower variable compensation expense for in house account representatives 
in addition  we reduced incentive compensation for management because of declining performance metrics and have suspended the company matching component of our k plan 
in june of  we began an initiative to increase the number of in house account representatives 
by the end of the year  we increased those associates by approximately from mid second quarter levels 
variable compensation will have an impact on salaries and benefits expense in  depending on the level of cash collections and achievement of incentive goals 

table of contents collections expense 
overall  collections expense was relatively flat year over year 
the following table summarizes the significant components of collections expense and the changes in each years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change forwarding fees court and process server costs lettering campaign and telecommunications costs data provider costs other total collections expense forwarding fees include fees paid to third parties to collect on our behalf 
these fees increased in compared to because of higher rates paid  partially offset by reduced cash collections generated by third parties 
the percent of gross cash collections from such third party relationships were and for and  respectively 
rates paid to forwarding agencies vary based on the age and type of paper that we outsource 
late in  we began incurring costs related to our agency relationship with a firm in india  which we have engaged to collect on our behalf using our technology and collections model under a per seat fee arrangement 
we expect fees paid under this relationship to increase in as the number of seats increases 
court costs and process server costs decreased year over year as we reduced the activity in these categories 
in  we entered into a third party relationship that has allowed us to better match legal costs with the associated collections 
during and  this relationship has resulted in lower court costs offset by higher forwarding fees based on cash collections 
in the future  we expect to place fewer accounts with this third party 
during  we became more selective in our variable collection activities  such as telecommunications  lettering campaigns  and use of data provider services  resulting in reductions in the related expenses 
occupancy 
while occupancy expense remained consistent in compared to  we continue to review our capacity to ensure we are utilizing all of our space effectively 
in late  we entered into a sublease agreement  which will expire in early  for a portion of our now abandoned phoenix facility 
in addition  during  we entered into two new lease agreements to replace our facilities in san antonio and phoenix now located nearby in tempe 
the new lease agreements in san antonio and tempe are for less space than the prior agreements  which we expect to reduce occupancy expense in future periods 
administrative 
administrative expenses decreased during in almost all areas  reflecting on our focus on cost control 
we intend to continue to be diligent in controlling these costs even as collections return to pre levels 
impairment of assets 
impairment of our trademark and trade names intangible asset was million for the year ended december  we performed an assessment of the fair value of the asset using a discounted cash flow methodology and determined that it was below the carrying value  primarily as a result of a decline in business activity related to the asset 
during  we decided to no longer service medical receivables on a contingent fee basis 
as a result  we recognized a charge of million to impair the net carrying balance of intangible assets for customer contracts and relationships associated with the contingent medical collection business 
we also recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of to write off an investment in a new software product after a decision to discontinue its implementation 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to interest expense of million for interest expense was of cash 
table of contents collections during compared with for the decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest rates and decreased average borrowings during compared to the same period in average borrowings were million for the year ended december  compared to million for during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement  which included an increase in average interest rates and changes to the financial covenants 
as a result  interest expense will be higher in future periods than it would have been under the terms of the agreement prior to amendment 
the increase in interest rates will have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately million in  if our average borrowing levels remain consistent

for the year ended december   the federal tax rate was and state tax rate was net of federal tax effect 
the percentage point decrease in the federal tax rate was the effect of permanent book verses tax differences and the net effect of state taxes 
the overall decrease in tax expense was primarily a result of the pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  compared to pre tax income of million for the same period of year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from our main line of business  the purchase and collection of delinquent or charged off consumer receivables

purchased receivable revenues reflect net impairments recognized during the year ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
cash collections for the years ended december  and include collections from fully amortized portfolios of million and million  respectively  of which were reported as revenue

before  we had granted share based compensation to our non associate directors and occasionally to certain key associates  generally for recruiting or retention reasons 
during  we began a program to issue periodic share based awards to a broader group of key management associates including our executive officers 
a portion of the share based compensation grants to executive officers included the use of performance conditions for vesting

the following table summarizes the significant components of collections expense and the changes in each years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change forwarding fees court and process server costs lettering campaign and telecommunications costs data provider costs other total collections expense collections expense decreased primarily due to a million decline in variable costs associated with reduced spending on in house collection efforts  lower data provider costs and better expense management 
in addition  the reduction of variable expense included a million savings in court costs associated with our legal forwarding collections as a result of a new third party relationship that allows us to better match these costs with the associated collections 
the savings were partially offset by an increased contingency rate under this relationship which resulted in an increase in forwarding fees paid of million 
the remaining increase in forwarding fees  million  is the result of an increase in collections from third party relationships attorneys and collection agencies

table of contents seasonality the success of our business depends on our ability to collect on our purchased portfolios of charged off consumer receivables 
collections tend to be seasonally higher in the first and second quarters of the year due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and other factors 
conversely  collections tend to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to consumers spending in connection with summer vacations  the holiday season and other factors 
however  revenue recognized is relatively level  excluding the impact of impairments  due to the application of the provisions prescribed by the interest method of accounting 
in addition  our operating results may be affected to a lesser extent by the timing of purchases of charged off consumer receivables due to the initial costs associated with purchasing and integrating these receivables into our system 
consequently  income and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter

liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of cash have been from operations and bank borrowings 
we have traditionally used cash for acquisitions of purchased receivables  repayment of bank borrowings  purchasing property and equipment and working capital to support growth 
we believe that cash generated from operations combined with borrowings currently available under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in the future  if we need additional capital for investment in purchased receivables  working capital to grow our business or acquire other businesses  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or we may seek to increase the availability under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings we maintain a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders named therein  that originated on june  and was amended on march  and on october  the credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we have a five year

the credit facilities bear interest at to basis points over prime depending upon our liquidity  as defined in the credit agreement 
alternately  at our discretion  we may borrow by entering into one  two  three  six or twelve month london inter bank offer rate libor contracts at rates between to basis points over the respective libor  depending on our liquidity 
our revolving credit facility includes an accordion loan feature that allows us to request a million increase as well as sublimits for million of letters of credit and for million of swingline loans 
the credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets 
the credit agreement also contains certain covenants and restrictions that we must comply with  which as of december  were leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda defined as consolidated net income  plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation  amortization  amortized collections  non cash losses and non cash expenses  less extraordinary gains  non cash gains and non cash income cannot exceed i to at any time on or before december  or ii to at any time thereafter  ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth as defined cannot exceed i to at any time on or before december   ii to at any time on or after december  and on or before march  or iii to to any time thereafter  and consolidated tangible net worth as defined must equal or exceed million plus of positive consolidated net income for three consecutive fiscal quarters ending december  and for each fiscal year ending thereafter  such amount to be added as of december  and as of the end of each such fiscal year thereafter 
the financial covenants restrict our ability to borrow against the revolving credit facility 
at december   total available borrowings on our revolving credit facility were million  however  our capacity to borrow under the terms of the agreement was limited to million 
the limitation is based on the ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth  our most restrictive covenant at december  the net loss during reduced our borrowing capacity under this covenant by approximately million 
this borrowing capacity will be reduced further if we incur cumulative net losses in future periods that reduce our consolidated tangible net worth 
the credit agreement contains a provision that requires us to repay excess cash flow as defined to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our term loan facility 
the excess cash flow repayment provisions are of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was less than or equal to to but greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  or if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to to as of the end of such fiscal year 
as of december   our leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement was to based on the excess cash flow provisions  we are required to make a prepayment of approximately million on the term loan facility in march  related to the results of operations for year ended december  we also made a required prepayment of million during the first quarter of related to the excess cash flow provisions for payment of the excess cash flow will not reduce our total borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility are paid quarterly  in arrears  and are calculated as an amount equal to a margin of on the average amount available on the revolving credit facility 

table of contents the credit agreement requires us to effectively cap  collar or exchange interest rates on a notional amount of at least of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan facility 
as such  we have an interest rate swap agreement that hedges a portion of the interest on the term loan facility 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements  derivative financial instruments and risk management for additional information 
we had million and million of borrowings outstanding on our credit facilities at december  and  respectively  of which million and million was outstanding on the term loan facility and million and million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
along with the excess cash flow prepayment requirements  the term loan facility requires quarterly repayments totaling million annually until expiration 
the decrease in total outstanding borrowings in was a result of us repaying a significant portion of the revolving credit facility during the year 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings  including the effect of the interest rate swap  at december  was 
the increase in interest rates resulting from the amendment to the credit agreement in will have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately million in  if our borrowing levels remain consistent 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit agreement as of december  cash flows the majority of our purchases of receivables have been funded with internal cash flow and with borrowings against our revolving credit facility 
for the year ended december   we invested million in purchased receivables  net of buybacks  including receivables accrued for funding in  funded primarily by internal cash flow 
our cash balance decreased from million at december  to million as of december  we also made net repayments on our credit facilities of million during our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for these years was generated primarily from operating income earned through cash collections as adjusted for non cash items and the timing of payments of income taxes  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
we rely heavily on cash generated from our operating activities to allow us to fund operations and re invest in purchased receivables 
cash provided by operations has decreased over the past three years as a result of lower cash collections on purchased receivables 
in  the decline in cash collections was greater than the corresponding decline in spending on operating expenses 
continued declines in cash collections  if not offset by reductions in operating expenses will further decrease cash provided by operating activities in future periods 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of cash used for investing purposes is for acquisitions of purchased receivables  net of cash collections applied to principal  which is net of buybacks for all vintage years 
we intentionally reduced our level of investment in paper during the first half of to build capacity to invest more in the second half of the year and into  in anticipation of additional declines in pricing 
as a result  we did not use as much cash in investing activities in as in prior years 
we believe that we have sufficient capacity in our credit agreement when combined with anticipated cash flows from operations to fund investment in purchased receivables at or above historical levels 
however  continued pressure on our collections in coupled with the borrowing constraints under our revolving credit facility may cause purchasing to be at lower levels than we have seen historically 
we acquired million  million and million in property and equipment in  and  respectively 
the amounts in and were primarily related to software and computer equipment for our new collection platform  improvements to our telecommunications systems and our office moves in san antonio and tempe 
implementation of the new collection platform is funded through cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents financing activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  and provided cash of million for the year ended december  cash used by financing activities for and was primarily due to net repayments on our revolving credit facility and term loan facility of million and million  respectively 
we also made payments for deferred financing fees million and million  respectively  associated with the first and second amendments on the credit agreement 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily a result of borrowings of million under our credit facilities and former credit agreement 
the cash provided by financing activities in was partially offset by million repayment on our former credit agreement  credit facilities and capital lease obligations as well as payments of million for our repurchase of million shares in accordance with the recapitalization plan 
furthermore  our board of directors declared a special one time cash dividend of per share  or million in aggregate  which was paid on july  to holders of record on july  also in  we exercised our right to buy shares from former associates for per share  or million 
cash provided by financing activities will increase in future periods to the extent we use net borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund purchases of paper 
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus the benefit provision for income taxes  interest expense  net  depreciation and amortization  share based compensation  gain loss on sale of assets  net  impairment of assets and purchased receivables amortization 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  and should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net loss income prepared on a us gaap basis 
adjusted ebitda does not purport to represent cash flow provided by  or used in  operating activities as defined by us gaap  which is presented in our statements of cash flows 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income  taxes  depreciation and amortization including purchased receivable amortization  and share based compensation  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  and analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry 
our management uses adjusted ebitda for planning purposes  including in the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts  in communications with the board of directors  stockholders  analysts and investors concerning our financial performance  as a significant factor in determining bonuses under management s annual incentive compensation program  and as a measure of operating performance for the financial covenants in our amended credit agreement  because it provides information related to our ability to provide cash flows for investments in purchased receivables  capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital requirements

future contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  years ending december  thereafter capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations forward flow obligations revolving credit term loan contractual interest on derivative instruments total in  we signed an agreement with a software provider and initiated a project to install a new collection platform 
we have a contractual commitment to purchase million in additional software and consulting services over the next year to fully implement this software 
we have four forward flow contracts that have terms beyond december  two forward flow contracts expire in december and have estimated monthly purchases of approximately million  depending upon circumstances 
the remaining two forward flow contracts expire in march and april and have estimated monthly purchases of approximately million and million  respectively 
to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our revolving credit facility  it would be due in june or earlier as defined in the credit agreement 
interest on our revolving credit facility is estimated and is not included within the amount outstanding as of december  to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our term loan facility  it would be due in june the variable interest is not included within the amount outstanding as of december  in addition  we are required to prepay approximately million of principal on our term loan facility in the first quarter of this prepayment is related to the excess cash flow for the year ended december   as defined in our credit amendment 
we have a liability of million relating to uncertain tax positions  which has been excluded from the table above because the amount and fiscal year of the payment cannot be reliably estimated 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generally account for our revenues from collections on our purchased receivables by using the interest method of accounting interest method in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires making reasonable estimates of the timing and amount of future cash collections 
application of the interest method requires the use of estimates  primarily estimated remaining collections  to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are primarily based on historical cash collections and payer dynamics 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than the remaining collections estimate  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
the estimates of remaining collections are sensitive to the inputs used and the performance of each pool 
performance is dependent on macro economic factors and the specific demographic makeup of the debtors in the pool 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on reversal of impairments or an increase in yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an unfavorable impact and may result in an impairment 
impairments to purchased receivables reduce our consolidated tangible net worth and put further pressure on the financial covenants in our credit facilities 
we use the cost recovery method when collections on a particular portfolio cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no revenue is recognized until we have fully collected the cost of the portfolio 
we adopted the interest method in january and apply it to purchased receivables acquired after december  the provisions of the interest method that relate to decreases in expected cash flows amend previously followed guidance for consistent treatment and apply prospectively to purchased receivables acquired before january  we purchase pools of homogenous accounts receivable and record each pool at its acquisition cost 
pools purchased after may be aggregated into one or more static pools within each quarter  based on common risk characteristics 
risk characteristics of purchased receivables are assumed to be similar since purchased receivables are usually in the late stages of the post charged off collection cycle 
we therefore aggregate most pools purchased within each quarter 
pools purchased before may not be aggregated with other pool purchases 
each static pool  either aggregated or non aggregated  retains its own identity and does not change over the remainder of its life 
each static pool is accounted for as a single unit for recognition of revenue  principal payments and impairments 
each static pool of receivables is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
an irr is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows 
the irr is applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts to determine the revenue recognized 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
this review includes an assessment of the actual results of cash collections  the work effort used and expected to be used in future periods  the components of the static pool including type of paper  the average age of purchased receivables  certain demographics and other factors that help us understand how a pool may perform in future periods 
we also review the actual performance against expected cash collections using our historical model 
generally  to the extent the differences in actual performance versus expected performance are favorable and the results of the review by pool is also favorable  the irr is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
if the differences in actual performance results in revised cash flow estimates that are less than the original estimates  and if the results of the review lead us to believe the decline in performance is not temporary  the irr remains unchanged and an impairment is recognized 
if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  reversal of the previously recognized impairment is made prior to any increases to the irr 

table of contents these periodic reviews  and any adjustments or impairments including those in the fourth quarter of  are discussed with our audit committee 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization we periodically review the carrying value of intangible assets not subject to amortization  including goodwill  to determine whether an impairment may exist 
us gaap requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets not subject to amortization be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value  goodwill is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the book value of that goodwill 
if the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the estimate of fair value of our goodwill reporting unit  the purchased receivables operating segment  is determined using various valuation techniques including market capitalization and an analysis of discounted cash flows 
at the time of the annual goodwill impairment test  november   market capitalization was substantially higher than book value and goodwill was considered not to be impaired  however  a decrease in market capitalization would have resulted in book value greater than market capitalization 
we also performed a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires us to make various judgmental assumptions including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
we base assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates on our five year budget and long term plans 
we used a discount rate of  which reflected our estimate of cost of equity and our assessment of the risk inherent in the reporting unit 
the fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis exceeded the book value as of december  however  a increase in the discount rate  or a decrease in cash flow of approximately million in each year would result in an excess of book value over fair value and indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the annual impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization  for example  trademark and trade names  consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using various discounted cash flow valuation methodologies 
significant assumptions are inherent in this process  including estimates of discount rates and future cash flows 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets and include estimates of the cost of debt and equity for market participants in the company s industry 
we performed a discounted cash flow analysis of our trademark and trade names as of september  using a discount rate of and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value 
we recorded an impairment of  which is included in impairment of assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial 
table of contents reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be reversed 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  a valuation allowance would be established and charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to the interest rate risk with our credit facilities 
we may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate exposure associated with our outstanding debt 
the outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
in september  we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement whereby  on a quarterly basis  we swap variable rates equal to three month libor for fixed rates on the notional amount of million 
every year thereafter  on the anniversary of the swap agreement the notional amount decreases by million 
the outstanding unhedged borrowings on our credit facilities were million as of december  interest rates on unhedged borrowings may be based on the prime rate or libor  at our discretion 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on the unhedged borrowings  interest expense would have increased approximately million for each of the years ended december  and  and million for the year ended december  the swap was determined to be highly effective in hedging against fluctuations in variable interest rates associated with the underlying debt since we entered into the agreement 
interest rates have decreased since we entered into our swap agreement  reducing the fair value and resulting in a liability balance 
additional declines in interest rates will further reduce the fair value  while increasing interest rates will increase the fair value 
interest rate fluctuations do not have a material impact on interest income
