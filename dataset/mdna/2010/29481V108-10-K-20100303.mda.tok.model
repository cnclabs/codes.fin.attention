item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in to provide cardiac safety solutions to evaluate the safety of new drugs 
we provide technology and service solutions that enable the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries to collect  interpret and distribute cardiac safety data more efficiently 
we are a market leader in providing centralized electrocardiographic solutions cardiac safety solutions and a provider of technology solutions that streamline the clinical trials process by enabling our clients to evolve from traditional  paper based methods to electronic processing using our epro products and solutions 
on june   we completed the sale of certain assets relating to our edc operations 
under the terms of the transaction  omnicomm systems  inc issued to us million shares of common stock and assumed certain liabilities including deferred revenue relating to our edc operations in exchange for our edc assets which primarily included our edc software  applications and fixed assets and million in cash we paid 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain on the sale of these assets of million within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
the revenue and cost of revenue of our former edc operations have been reclassified from the licenses and services categories to the edc category on the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
additionally  the remaining revenues and costs of sales in licenses  related to cardiac safety reporting and epro  were reclassified to the services category on the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
our services revenues consist primarily of our services offered under our cardiac safety and  to a lesser extent  epro tm solutions 
our site support revenue consists of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and logistics management 
we offer cardiac safety solutions  which are utilized by pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  medical device companies  clinical trial sponsors and clinical research organizations cros during the conduct of clinical trials 
our cardiac safety solutions include the collection  interpretation and distribution of electrocardiographic ecg data and images and are performed during clinical trials in all phases of the clinical research process 
the ecg provides an electronic map of the heart s rhythm and structure  and is performed in most clinical trials 
our cardiac safety solutions permit assessments of the safety of therapies by documenting the occurrence of cardiac electrical change 
specific trials  such as a thorough qtc study  focus on the cardiac safety profile of a compound 
thorough qtc studies are comprehensive studies that typically are of large volume and short duration and are generally required by the united states food and drug administration fda under guidance issued in by the international committee on harmonization ich e 
we also offer site support  which includes the rental and sale of cardiac safety equipment along with related supplies and logistics management 
we also offer epro solutions along with proprietary clinical assessments 
services revenues consist of cardiac safety and epro services that we provide on a fee for services basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
we also provide cardiac safety consulting services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
site support revenues are recognized at the time of sale or over the rental period 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of one or more delivered elements is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
we have recorded reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
unbilled revenue is revenue that is recognized but is currently not billable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms 
in general  such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules  
table of contents but recognized as revenue as services are performed 
amounts included in unbilled revenue are expected to be collected within one year and are included within current assets 
our former edc business is included in edc licenses and services and included license revenue  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
we recognized up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement existed  delivery of the software and related documentation occurred  collectability was probable and the license fee was fixed or determinable 
we recognized monthly and annual term license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees were recognized evenly over the term of the service 
we recognized revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which was typically twelve months 
we provided consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognized revenues as we performed the services 
cost of services includes the cost of cardiac safety and epro services 
cost of services consists primarily of direct costs related to our centralized cardiac safety services and includes wages  depreciation  amortization  fees paid to consultants and other direct operating costs 
cost of site support consists primarily of wages  cardiac safety equipment rent and depreciation  related supplies  cost of equipment sold  shipping expenses and other direct operating costs 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of wages and incentive compensation paid to sales personnel  travel expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures

costs of our former edc operations included primarily wages  fees paid to outside consultants and other direct operating costs related to our software licensing  consulting and client support functions 
we conduct our operations through offices in the united states us and the united kingdom uk 
our international net revenues represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of our revenues are allocated among our geographic segments based upon the profit split transfer pricing methodology 
the profit split methodology equalizes gross margins for each legal entity  based upon its respective direct revenue or direct costs  as determined by the relevant revenue source 
results of operations executive overview net revenues were million for  a decrease of million or from million in due primarily to the confluence of two key factors 
the first factor was the deep recession of  which significantly affected our clients  both large and small 
large pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies became very conservative in their funding of research and development activities and our small to mid sized clients were severely impacted by the tight credit conditions from the recession 
the second factor was a very sharp decline in the demand for thorough qtc studies from our clients 
these studies performed by ert are largely for small to mid sized clients  it was this sector of the economy that was most severely impacted by the very tight credit conditions caused by the recession 
both of these factors resulted in significantly reduced demand for our cardiac safety services and a corresponding fall in our revenue 
in addition  revenue from the acquired backlog of covance cardiac safety services  inc ccss totaled million in and declined to million in as this backlog nears completion 
to a lesser degree  we also had lower revenue from routine business 
we also sold our edc operation in june which contributed million of revenue in compared to million in gross margin percentage was in compared to in gross margin percentage is significantly impacted by transaction volume which declined in compared to we also experienced a slight decline in average transaction pricing in as compared to in the shorter term  costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
we also experienced a slight decline in average transaction pricing in as compared to the decline in the gross margin percentage compared to was partially offset by the elimination of legacy and transition costs incurred during associated with processing the 
table of contents ccss backlog during the nine month period in during which we integrated the ccss operations 
in addition during  we incurred lower depreciation and amortization expense as older  more expensive equipment became fully depreciated 
operating income for was million or of total net revenues compared to million or of total net revenues in total expenses were million in  a decrease of million from million in overall expenses decreased primarily due to the elimination of transition costs related to the integration of the ccss operations  which was completed in september we also had lower variable incentive compensation expense in consistent with our reduced operating results and lower depreciation as some of our edc equipment was fully depreciated and the amortization of ccss intangibles declined 
our effective income tax rate for was compared to in net income for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in commencing in the fourth quarter of and into  general business and economic conditions deteriorated globally 
during this time  we experienced an increased focus in phase iii opportunities  a decline in the number of thorough qtc bookings along with a delay in starts for certain thorough qtc trials  and these trends have continued through much of fiscal we believe the increase in phase iii opportunities will provide us with a strong base of business in the future  however  this business will take longer to turn into revenue 
we believe that the delays in thorough qtc trials are related to timing as the result of the uncertain economic environment  especially in small to mid sized customers which have been negatively impacted by funding limitations 
thorough qtc trials are generally required to be performed due to regulatory guidance  however  the timing of when these trials are done is discretionary 
we also experienced an increase in awards of new and expanded exclusive or near exclusive long term enterprise relationships with large pharmaceutical companies during the latter portion of fiscal and continuing into  including several with whom we had very little business in the past 
in exchange for these long term enterprise relationships with large pharmaceutical companies  which are targeted to generate larger volumes of business  we have made selective pricing concessions which we believe will have the effect of lowering overall average transaction pricing in the future as studies performed under these agreements become active and generate revenue 
we have also recently implemented a series of cost reductions which we believe will lessen the impact of any prior pricing reduction on our gross margin percentage 
overall  we believe the fundamental drivers of our core business remain positive 
we believe that we have sufficient operating and technology capacity to support significant future growth in our business if and when it should occur 
however  a continued weakened global economy could have a negative impact on future results of operations

revenues the decrease in services revenues was primarily due to a million reduction related to a decrease in transactions performed in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due largely to the decline in thorough qtc studies and  to a lesser extent  a decline in routine studies and the decline in revenue from acquired backlog of ccss 
there was also a decrease in average revenue per transaction that was largely due to a heavier weighting of semi automatic studies which carry lower transaction prices and a decrease in average pricing due to the impact of newly negotiated longer term enterprise agreements with large clients  the total impact of which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately million 
project management fees decreased million  consistent with the decreased cardiac safety activity 
the balance of the decrease is due to a million decrease in cardiac safety consulting revenue and a number of smaller decreases totaling million 
beginning in january  we entered into an arrangement with a consulting company owned by our chairman  dr 
morganroth  relating to dr 
morganroth s initiation of a company consulting practice through the transition of his historic consulting services to us 
in return  dr

the balance of the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental revenue from cardiac safety equipment due to a lower average price per unit  partially offset by an increase in units rented and an increase in supplies revenue 
the lower average price per unit was a result of planned actions that we have recently taken to improve our competitiveness with regard to this component of our revenue

table of contents our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  reflects a change in the calculation of transfer pricing for cardiac safety services 
through  we calculated our transfer pricing for cardiac safety services using a profit split methodology based on cost 
after reviewing the transfer pricing methodology  management decided to modify its application of the profit split methodology for cardiac safety services to allocate costs based on revenue beginning in had we maintained the same calculation in as we used in  the income tax provision would have been increased by approximately million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a special benefit of million related to our determination that a portion of our uk subsidiary s current undistributed net earnings  as well as the future net earnings  will be permanently reinvested  a tax benefit of approximately million related to the reconciliation of the tax provision to the us federal tax return and a million tax benefit related to the reversal of a tax accrual for a previously uncertain tax position

smaller increases in a number of expense categories such as advertising and marketing  royalties and stock option expense comprised the balance of the increase in selling and marketing expense 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues reflected the fact that the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue

table of contents we had historically provided deferred taxes under apb for the presumed ultimate repatriation to the united states of earnings from our uk subsidiary 
the indefinite reversal criterion of apb allows us to overcome that presumption to the extent the earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
as of january   we determined that a portion of our uk subsidiary s current undistributed net earnings  as well as the future net earnings  will be permanently reinvested 
as a result of the apb change in assertion  we reduced our deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by million during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
prior to  we had historically placed our investments in municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates and maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
due to the financial market conditions prevalent during the latter part of and  we had invested primarily in liquid money market funds 
we resumed investing in highly rated securities in the other categories noted above beginning in the fourth quarter of of the million  million is held by our uk subsidiary 
although a portion of our uk subsidiary s current undistributed net earnings  as well as the future net earnings  will be permanently reinvested  we believe that this does not have a material impact on our overall liquidity 
for the year ended december   our operations provided cash of million  a decrease of million compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of million of lower net income in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   a million decrease in accrued expenses in the year ended december  as compared to a million increase in the year ended december  which was largely the result of the payment of a greater amount in for variable incentive compensation related to the prior year s results  a million decrease in depreciation and amortization and a million decrease in net income tax liabilities in the year ended december  as compared to a million decrease in the year ended december  changes in income taxes  including deferred income taxes  are due to the timing and size of income tax payments and provision 
the tax provision decreased in due to lower taxable income  but at a higher effective tax rate 
partially offsetting this negative impact on cash flow was a decrease in accounts receivable in the year ended december  of million as compared to an increase of million in the year ended december  the comparative decrease was related to focused collection efforts and a decrease in revenue 
also offsetting this negative impact on cash flow was an increase in deferred revenue in the year ended december  of million as compared to a decrease of million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   our investing activities used cash of million as compared to million during the year ended december  we incurred million and million in the year ended december  and  respectively  for contingent payments and transaction costs related to the ccss acquisition and million during the year ended december  related to the sale of the edc operations 
investment proceeds were million during the year ended december  with no activity during the year ended december  while investment purchases were million during the year ended december  with no activity during the year ended december  during the year ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of property and equipment 
included in property and equipment is million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  of internal use software including software associated with the development of a data and communications management services software product expert used in connection with our centralized core cardiac safety ecg services 
the balance of the change was due to a decrease in purchases of ecg equipment commensurate with the decrease in revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   our financing activities used cash of million compared to providing million for the year ended december  in the year ended december  and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of our common stock under our stock buy back program 

table of contents we have a line of credit arrangement with wachovia bank  national association  a wells fargo company  totaling million which expires on june  to date  we have not borrowed any amounts under our line of credit 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  which reduced our available borrowings under the line of credit to million 
we have commitments to purchase approximately million of private label cardiac safety equipment from a manufacturer over a twelve month period beginning upon the completion of our user acceptance testing  which is currently anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of we expect to purchase this cardiac safety equipment in the normal course of business and thus this commitment does not represent a significant commitment above our expected purchases of ecg equipment during this period 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will occur or that such financing will be available or available on terms acceptable to us  particularly in view of current capital market uncertainty 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of million shares  of which million shares remain to be purchased as of december  the stock buy back authorization allows us  but does not require us  to purchase the authorized shares 
the purchase of the remaining shares authorized could require us to use a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and investments and could also require us to seek additional external financing 
during the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
during the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
on november   we completed the acquisition of ccss from covance inc under the terms of our agreement to purchase ccss  the total initial purchase consideration was million 
we have also incurred approximately million in transaction costs 
we may also pay contingent consideration of up to approximately million based upon our potential realization of revenue from the backlog transferred and from new contracts secured through covance s marketing activities 
the period for contingent payments runs through december  through december   covance earned million of this contingent amount  of which million was recognized in  million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  at december   approximately million of the contingent amount earned remained to be paid to covance  which we recorded in accounts payable 
these contingent payments increased goodwill by million 
under the terms of the marketing agreement  covance agreed to exclusively use us as its provider of centralized cardiac safety solutions for a ten year period  subject to certain exceptions  and we agreed to pay referral fees on certain revenues 
the following table presents contractual obligations information as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases total the long term portion of other liabilities is comprised of the present value of estimated lease costs for the reno location 
the gross amount of the payments associated with these liabilities is included in operating leases in the contractual obligations table above 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation and changing prices generally do not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

this consensus eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements have vsoe or tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted 
the accounting standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are evaluating the potential impact of these requirements on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following are our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our former electronic data capture edc business is included in edc licenses and services and included license revenue  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
we recognized up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement existed  delivery of the software and related documentation occurred  collectability was probable and the license fee was fixed or determinable 
we recognized monthly and annual term license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees were recognized evenly over the term of the service 
we recognized revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which was typically twelve months 
we provided consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognized revenues as we performed the services 
services revenues consist of cardiac safety and  to a lesser extent  epro tm services that we provide on a fee for services basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
we also provide cardiac safety consulting services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
site support revenues consist of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and logistics management and are recognized at the time of sale or over the rental period 
at the time of the transaction  management assesses whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms or upon implementation or client acceptance  the fee is accounted for as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due or after implementation or client acceptance has occurred 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and the creditworthiness of the client 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
under a typical contract for cardiac safety services  clients pay us a portion of our fee for these services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit  some of which is typically nonrefundable upon contract termination 
revenues are then recognized under cardiac safety service contracts as the services are performed 

table of contents for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of one or more delivered elements is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
we have recorded reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
unbilled revenue is revenue that is recognized but is currently not billable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms 
in general  such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules  but recognized as revenue as services are performed 
amounts included in unbilled revenue are expected to be collected within one year and are included within current assets 
business combinations in november  we completed the acquisition of ccss  and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed based on their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer relationships  proprietary technology and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed 
for a discussion of how we allocated the purchase price of ccss  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
future business combinations will be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of asc  as discussed above in recent accounting pronouncements 
goodwill we carry a significant amount of goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test at least annually 
we perform the impairment test annually as of december or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired 
no provisions for goodwill impairment were recorded during or in connection with the sale of certain assets of our edc operations  we allocated million of goodwill to our edc operations which was included in the calculation of the gain on sale 
when it is determined that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  measurement of any impairment will be based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management having to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the consolidated statement of operations will reflect additional income tax expense 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million related to the uncertain realization of certain deferred tax assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we compute depreciation on our property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from two to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term 
system development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over four or five years or  in the case of enhancements which have no stand alone use  the remaining life of the initial project 
we compute amortization on our intangible assets  other than goodwill  over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from one to ten years 
amortization of backlog from the ccss acquisition is recognized on an accelerated basis while other intangibles are amortized using the straight line method 
changes in the estimated useful lives of long lived assets could have a material effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of options using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model require estimates of the expected term the stock based awards are held until exercised  the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock options 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this form k  for a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we generally place our investments in money market funds  municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
due to the financial market conditions prevalent during the latter part of and  we had invested primarily in liquid money market funds 
we resumed investing in highly rated securities in the other categories noted above beginning in the fourth quarter of we actively manage our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments  but in order to ensure liquidity  will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
the impact on interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and log term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources as part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents foreign currency risk we operate on a global basis from locations in the united states us and the united kingdom uk 
all international net revenues and expenses are billed or incurred in either us dollars or pounds sterling 
as such  we face exposure to adverse movements in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling 
as the currency rate changes  translation of the statement of operations of our uk subsidiary from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
we do not currently hedge translation risks because any cash flows from uk operations are reinvested in the uk 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling would have impacted the reported operating income for the year ended december  by approximately million
