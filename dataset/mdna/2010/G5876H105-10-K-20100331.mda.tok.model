industry background the semiconductor industry has evolved over the last four decades primarily due to the rapid and systematic advancements in photolithography techniques and new materials used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices  which has enabled the fabrication of transistor devices with ever finer feature sizes 
as transistor line widths shrink over time  transistor density increases proportionally  enabling the manufacture of ever more complex devices in a fixed area of silicon 
this phenomenon known as moore s law  states that with the transition to each new successive process node  transistor device size will shrink by  along with a increase in the number of transistors  and a increase device performance 
furthermore  the transition to ever small process geometries results in proportionally lower power consumption of integrated circuits 
the effect of moore s law on the semiconductor industry has been a rapid increase in the processing speed  the device density of integrated circuits and improved power efficiency  which has enabled the integration of multiple complex functions onto a single piece of silicon  which in the past  would have required multiple discrete integrated circuits 
concurrently  with the advances in semiconductor technology  there has been an evolutionary shift toward standards based communication interconnect protocols 
the transition to standards based communication protocols  such as ethernet  has given rise to a large and diverse number of electronic systems suppliers to address the simultaneous transmission of voice  video  audio and data through both wired and wireless connections 
the capability to transmit and process information has led to both business enterprise and consumer electronic devices sharing and communicating ever larger amounts information for many different applications 
due in part to the ongoing evolution of both semiconductor and communications technology  the bandwidth demanded by users has continued to expand at an exponential rate 
additionally  as the bandwidth demand of both enterprise and consumer users increase  there has been a commensurate increase in the required amount of data storage capacity 
we believe the market effects enabled by both the advances in semiconductor and communication technologies will provide a large and growing market for our products  technologies and intellectual property capabilities 
within most modern electronic systems  in both the enterprise and consumer application domain  the device interconnects and data transmission occurs within the analog signal domain 
however  due to advanced technologies  modern systems approaches and new algorithms  most new products convert the analog signals into digital signals to process the information 
given the high volume and cost sensitive nature of both enterprise and consumer applications  it is very beneficial to be able to integrate many of the analog and digital functions onto a single integrated circuit  which can help to increase system performance  lower costs and lower overall power consumption 
as a result  these devices require a combination of both analog and digital integrated circuit technologies  more commonly known as mixed signal technology 
historically  the ability to manufacture mixed signal technologies required the use of expensive  non scalable semiconductor manufacturing process technologies 
however  to achieve price points that will accelerate the acceptance of these highly integrated mixed signal devices  a smaller number of semiconductor vendors  including us  have invested in the fundamental research and development capability  which allows for the use of high volume  lower cost and scalable complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos fabrication technology 
because the processing requirements of these mixed signal integrated circuits continue to expand with the increased performance and sophistication of the devices in which they are embedded  many of these integrated circuits are now also integrating high performance embedded microprocessors and complex digital signal processors to handle this increased workload 
this minimizes or eliminates the need for a costly host central processing unit cpu 
with improvements in the performance of such embedded microprocessors  devices can further expand their capabilities while at the same time minimizing power requirements 

table of contents many of these new  sophisticated devices are also handheld battery powered devices in which minimizing the power consumption is critical to maximize the life of the battery 
utilizing highly integrated chips as well as chips designed to optimize power efficiency is very important for these handheld devices 
additionally  advanced digital power management solutions that regulate the power supplied to the integrated circuits in an efficient and cost effective manner are becoming more and more important to help reduce overall power consumption as well as the total size of the power management solution 
given the increased sophistication of these devices  the high level of semiconductor integration  and the constant time to market pressures of the system manufacturers  it is becoming very important for a semiconductor manufacturer to develop a complete system level understanding of a device in order to provide optimal integration  software support and system reference designs to assist in timely product development

although toshiba and fujitsu revenue have not historically accounted for more than of our revenue  we have combined fiscal revenue for both toshiba and fujitsu together for reporting purposes based on toshiba s acquisition of fujitsu s disk drive operations in fiscal toshiba represented approximately  of our net revenue in fiscal and less than of net revenue in fiscal and our sales are made under purchase orders typically received between one week and four months prior to the scheduled delivery date 
these purchase orders can be cancelled without charge if notice is given within an agreed upon period 
because of the scheduling requirements of our foundries  we generally place firm orders for products with our suppliers up to weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to an order for the product 
these lead times typically change based on the current capacity at the foundries 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
the quantities actually purchased by the customer  as well as the shipment schedules  are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer s needs 
due to an industry practice that allows customers to cancel or change purchase orders with limited notice prior to the scheduled shipment dates  we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenue 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenue is related to 
table of contents inventory pulled by customers from rd party logistics providers 
as such  this revenue would not be included in the backlog 
research and development we believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost effective solutions for both existing and new markets 
our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high performance analog  mixed signal  digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits 
we devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our core intellectual property technology portfolio with designs that enable high performance  reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media 
we are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand alone integrated circuits into our products to reduce our customers overall system costs 
we have assembled a core team of engineers who have extensive experience in the areas of mixed signal circuit design  digital signal processing  embedded microprocessors  cmos technology and system level architectures 
we have invested  and expect that we will continue to invest  significant funds for research and development 
our research and development expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
manufacturing we believe that our fabless manufacturing approach provides us with the benefits of superior manufacturing capability as well as flexibility to move the manufacturing  assembly and testing of our products to those vendors that offer the best capability at an attractive price 
our engineers work closely with our foundries and other subcontractors to increase yields  lower manufacturing costs and improve quality 
integrated circuit fabrication the vast majority of our integrated circuits are substantially fabricated using widely available cmos processes  which provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs 
by outsourcing manufacturing  we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility 
this allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products 
we currently outsource a substantial percentage of our integrated circuit manufacturing to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  with the remaining manufacturing outsourced to other foundries primarily in asia 
we work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements 
our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced  sub micron manufacturing processes 
because finer manufacturing processes lead to enhanced performance  smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements  we continually evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance 
assembly and test we outsource all product packaging and substantially all testing requirements for our production products to several assembly and test subcontractors  including stats chippac ltd 
in singapore  malaysia  korea  taiwan and china  global testing corporation in singapore  siliconware precision industries in taiwan  ase electronics in singapore  taiwan and malaysia  and amkor in korea  philippines and taiwan 
the remainder of our production products is manufactured on a turnkey basis  whereby we purchase fully assembled and tested products from our foundry partners 
our products are designed to use low cost  standard packages and to be tested with widely available test equipment 
in addition  we specifically design our integrated circuits for ease of testability  further reducing production costs 

table of contents quality assurance we are certified to the international organization for standards quality management iso level 
we build quality into our products starting with the design and development process 
our designs are subjected to extensive circuit simulation under extreme conditions of temperature  voltage and processing before being committed to manufacture 
we pre qualify each of our subcontractors and conduct regular in depth quality audits 
we closely monitor foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality  reliability and yield levels 
all of our independent foundries and assembly test subcontractors have been awarded iso certification 
environmental management we monitor the environmental impact of our products 
the need for lead free solutions in electronic components and systems has received increasing attention within the semiconductor industry and many companies are moving towards becoming compliant with the restriction of hazardous substances directive rohs  the european legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances  including lead 
we believe that our current products are compliant with the rohs directive 
intellectual property our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  contractual provisions and licenses to protect our intellectual property 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  suppliers and customers and seek to control access to  and distribution of  our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  we often incorporate the intellectual property of other companies into our designs  and we have certain obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of their intellectual property 
it is possible  however  that the steps taken by us to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or our customers intellectual property may not be successful 
as of january   we have been issued and or have acquired over  us patents and over foreign patents and we have more than  us and foreign pending patent applications on various aspects of our technology  with expiration dates ranging approximately from to  however  we cannot be certain whether we will be issued patents as a result of these applications 
furthermore  it is possible that our patents may be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to others 
additionally  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or proprietary information to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
we may need to engage in litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property 
while our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property  we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change  the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information 
from time to time  we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products 
we cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms 

table of contents the integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights  which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation 
from time to time  we receive  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties 
although we defend these claims vigorously  it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits 
in addition  we may be sued in the future by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
any of these claims could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources to defend 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected 
in any of the pending or future claims or actions asserted against us  we may seek to obtain licenses under a third party s intellectual property rights  however  we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive  characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and pricing pressures imposed by high volume customers 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter our markets 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for our products depends on a number of factors  including the performance  features  quality and price of our products  timing and success of new product introductions by us  our customers and our competitors  emergence of new industry standards  ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity  and number and nature of our competitors in a given market 
our current products face competition from a number of sources 
we believe that our principal competitors for our read channel and storage soc devices are lsi corporation  renesas  stmicroelectronics and other new entrants 
our hard disk controller products compete primarily against devices offered by lsi and those internally developed by the hard disk manufacturers 
our tape drive controller products compete primarily against devices internally developed by tape drive manufacturers 
our switching products compete primarily against products from broadcom and vitesse semiconductor and our transceiver and connectivity products compete primarily with products from broadcom corporation  intel corporation  lsi corporation  realtek semiconductor and vitesse semiconductor 
in the market for system controllers  our products compete primarily against devices offered by plx technology  and our communications controllers and embedded processors compete directly with products from companies such as freescale semiconductor  netlogic microsystems and pmc sierra 
our cellular and applications processor products compete against products from broadcom  freescale semiconductor  mediatek incorporated  qualcomm corporation  samsung  stmicroelectronics and texas instruments 
our wireless lan and personal area network products compete against products from atheros communications  broadcom  cambridge silicon radios  intel  realtek and texas instruments 
our printing asic products compete primarily with products from pmc sierra and st microelectronics 
our power management products compete with products from a number of companies including analog devices  
table of contents international rectifier  intersil corporation  linear technology  maxim integrated products incorporated  national semiconductor and texas instruments 
in addition  we expect increased competition in the future from other emerging and established companies 
although we believe we will be able to successfully compete with existing and potential competitors  some of these current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer demands or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
our current or future competitors may develop and introduce new products that will be priced lower  provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
in addition  in the event of a manufacturing capacity shortage  these competitors may be able to manufacture products when we are unable to do so 
furthermore  current or potential competitors have established or may establish financial and strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers or other third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business 
in addition  many of our current and potential customers have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources 
some customers have already developed  or in the future may develop  technologies that will compete directly with our products 
we may also face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
historically  average unit selling prices in the integrated circuit industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
we expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures 
in order to offset expected declines in the average unit selling prices of our products  we will need to continue to reduce the cost of our products 
we intend to accomplish this by implementing design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing  assembly and testing  by entering into long term  strategic arrangements with our foundry partners to secure wafer capacity at reduced prices  by negotiating reduced charges from our foundries as and if volumes increase and by successfully managing our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships 
because we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities 
if we fail to introduce lower cost versions of our products in a timely manner or to successfully manage our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships  our business could be adversely impacted

item a 
risk factors additional factors that may affect future results investing in our common shares involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this report before you decide to purchase our common shares 
if any of the possible adverse events described below actually occurs  we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
in addition  the trading price of our common shares could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our financial condition and results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter  which may cause the price of our common shares to decline 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and could do so in the future 
because our results of operations are difficult to predict  you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those listed below and those identified throughout this risk factors section general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  and current general economic volatility  cancellations  rescheduling or deferrals of significant customer orders or shipments  
table of contents our ability to scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or demand for new products requested by our customers  our dependence on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenue  gain or loss of a key customer or design win  our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and effective manner  our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure for our manufacturing and assembly and test processes  failure to qualify our products or our suppliers manufacturing lines  our ability to exercise stringent quality control measures to obtain high yields  our ability to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies or achieve higher levels of design integration  effective and timely update of equipment and facilities as required for leading edge production capabilities  our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing personnel  our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and evolving industry standards and our customers changing demands  failure to protect our intellectual property  and any current and future litigation that could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business 
due to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and other factors  the price at which our common shares will trade is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
in future periods  if our revenues or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors  our stock price could decline 
on average  technology companies have been subject to a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in many other industries as a result of stock price volatility 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become involved in this type of litigation 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by the global financial crisis  which may cause a decline in the market price of our common shares 
we operate in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards 
from time to time  this industry has experienced significant demand downturns 
these downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories and sometimes accelerated erosion of prices 
these factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our net revenue  gross margin  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  during these downturns some competitors may become more aggressive in their pricing practices  which would adversely impact our gross margin 
furthermore  our foundry partners often require significant amounts of financing in order to build wafer fabrication facilities 
if they are unable to obtain financing and anticipated capacity is not completed  we may experience a shortage of capacity  which could increase our costs or reduce our ability to meet customer demand 
any downturns in the current environment may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of the markets in which we operate to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the global credit and financial markets over the past year and a half experienced extreme volatility and disruptions  including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  increased concerns about inflation and deflation  decreased consumer confidence  lower economic growth  volatile energy costs  increased 
table of contents unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
as a result  we experienced cancellations  deferrals and a significant slowdown in orders  which resulted in lower revenue levels 
these conditions make it difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and could cause global businesses to further reduce spending on our products and services  which would delay or lengthen sales cycles 
during challenging economic times our customers and distributors may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit  which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us 
if that were to occur  we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would increase 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent global economic recovery in the hard disk drive or in the semiconductor industry 
if the economy or markets in which we operate deteriorate from current levels  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  the combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions could adversely impact our results of operations 
a significant portion of our business is dependent on the hard disk drive industry  which is highly cyclical  experiences rapid technological change  and is facing increased competition from alternative technologies 
the hard disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and the technology changes rapidly 
as a result  this industry has historically been cyclical  with periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction 
these cycles may affect us because some of our customers are participants in this industry 
hard disk drive manufacturers tend to order more components than they may need during growth periods  and sharply reduce orders for components during periods of contraction 
in addition  advances in existing technologies and the introduction of new technologies may result in lower demand for disk drive storage devices  thereby reducing demand for our products 
rapid technological changes in the hard disk drive industry often result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry s participants 
if the hard disk drive manufacturers using our products do not retain or increase their market share  our sales may decrease 
future changes in the nature of information storage products may reduce demand for traditional hard disk drives 
for instance  products using alternative technologies  such as semiconductor memory  optical storage  solid state flash drives and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to manufacturers of hard disk drives 
flash memory has typically been more costly than disk drive technologies 
however  flash memory manufacturers have been reducing the prices for their products  which could enable them to complete more effectively with very small form factor hard disk drive products 
demand for hard disk drives could be reduced if alternative storage technologies such as flash memory can meet customers cost and capacity requirements 
our sales are concentrated in a few customers  and if we lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to any of these key customers  our revenues may decrease substantially 
we receive a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
for the year ended january   two customers accounted for a total of approximately of our net revenue 
sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer  as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets  and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future 
the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers  as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products 
in the future  these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all  purchase fewer products than they did in the past  or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way  particularly because substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  which permits our customers to cancel  change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty  
table of contents our customers may develop their own solutions  our customers may purchase integrated circuits from our competitors  or our customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost effective manner  our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability  in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products 
we must also achieve market acceptance for these products and enhancements 
if we do not successfully develop and achieve market acceptance for new and enhanced products  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will suffer 
the development of our products is highly complex 
we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements  and we could experience delays in the future 
even if new and enhanced products are introduced to the market  we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of them in a timely manner 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products  and the failure of any of these third party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers  decrease our sales and limit our growth 
we do not have our own manufacturing or assembly facilities and have very limited in house testing facilities  therefore  we rely on third party vendors to manufacture  assemble and test the products we design 
we currently rely on several third party foundries to produce our integrated circuit products 
we also currently rely on several third party assembly and test subcontractors to assemble  package and test our products 
this exposes us to a variety of risks  including the following regional concentration substantially all of our products are manufactured by third party foundries located in taiwan 
currently our alternative manufacturing sources are located in china and singapore 
in addition  substantially all of our assembly and testing facilities are located in singapore  taiwan  malaysia and the philippines 
because of the geographic concentration of these third party foundries  as well as our assembly and test subcontractors  we are exposed to the risk that their operations may be disrupted by regional disasters 
for example  the risk of an earthquake in taiwan and elsewhere in the pacific rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines to the facilities of our foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
taiwan has experienced significant earthquakes in the past  including  for example  in march  and may be subject to additional earthquakes that could disrupt manufacturing operations 
in addition  the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  the outbreak of avian flu and any similar future outbreaks in asia  where these foundries are located  could affect the production capabilities of our manufacturers by resulting in quarantines or closures 
in the event of such a quarantine or closure  if we were unable to quickly identify alternate manufacturing 
table of contents facilities  our revenues  cost of goods sold and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
if these vendors do not provide us with high quality products and services in a timely manner  or if one or more of these vendors terminates its relationship with us  we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis  our relationships with our customers could suffer  our sales could decrease and harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
no guarantee of capacity or supply availability of foundry capacity is constrained due to strong demand  and with limited exceptions  our vendors are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantities  or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
for example  as a consequence of the economic downturn  during the last several months of fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced some supply shortages due to the difficulties encountered by the foundries in rapidly increasing their production capacities from low utilization levels to the high utilization levels required due to a rapid increase in demand 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers  we may not have sufficient levels of production capacity with all of our foundries  despite signing an agreement with a foundry to reserve and secure foundry fabrication capacity for a fixed number of wafers 
despite this agreement  foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand  and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are or that have long term agreements with our main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to those customers 
this reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we use several independent foundries to manufacture our semiconductor products  most of our components are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time  and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  it may be difficult for us to transition the manufacture of our products to other foundries  and we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
this could result in a material decline in revenues  net income and cash flow 
in order to secure sufficient foundry capacity when demand is high and mitigate the risks described in the foregoing paragraph  we may enter into various arrangements with suppliers that could be costly and harm our results of operations  such as non refundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  and contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of integrated circuits over extended periods 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and any arrangements may be costly  reduce our financial flexibility  and not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
uncertain yields and quality the fabrication of integrated circuits is a complex and technically demanding process 
our foundries have from time to time experienced manufacturing defects and reduced manufacturing yields 
changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
poor yields from our foundries  or defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could cause us significant customer relations and business reputation problems  harm our financial results and result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could also seek damages from us 
table of contents for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
in addition  defects in our existing or new products could result in significant warranty  support and repair costs  and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
to the extent that we rely on outside suppliers to manufacture or assemble and test our products  we may have a reduced ability to control directly product delivery schedules and quality assurance 
this lack of control may result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could delay shipments of products or increase manufacturing  assembly  testing or other costs 
if we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers  our business and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
to achieve our business objectives  it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations 
for example  we have experienced periods of rapid growth and expansion 
through internal growth and acquisitions  we significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce from  employees  as of january   to  employees  as of january  in the future  we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers 
in that event  we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 
conversely  if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products  and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected  the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect  we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  in order to reduce expenses in the challenging economic environment  during the end of fiscal and the beginning of fiscal  we implemented certain cost reduction measures to reduce operating expenses 
because many of our expenses are fixed in the short term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand 
if customer demand does not increase as anticipated  our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levels 
our past growth has placed  and any future long term growth is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
to implement our current business and product plans  we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
although we have implemented an enterprise resource planning system to help us improve our planning and management processes  we anticipate that we will also need to continue to implement and improve a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  as well as additional procedures and other internal management systems 
these systems can be time consuming and expensive to implement  increase management responsibilities and divert management attention 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  or conversely  we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue  either of which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on third party distributors and manufacturers representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales 
from time to time  we enter into relationships with distributors and manufacturers representatives to sell our products  and we are unable to predict the extent to which these partners will be successful in marketing and 
table of contents selling our products 
moreover  many of our distributors and manufacturers representatives also market and sell competing products  and may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our future performance will also depend  in part  on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
if we cannot retain or attract quality distributors or manufacturers representatives  our sales and results of operations will be harmed 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our gross margin  or  conversely  we may have insufficient inventory  which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
customers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
in the recent past  some of our customers have developed excess inventories of their own products and have  as a consequence  deferred purchases of our products 
we cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management 
in addition  as an increasing number of our chips are being incorporated into consumer products  we anticipate greater fluctuations in demand for our products  which makes it more difficult to forecast customer demand 
we place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and  in some instances  may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand 
our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
for example  our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may be impaired by the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle 
the sales cycle for many of our products is long and requires us to invest significant resources with each potential customer without any assurance of sales to that customer 
our sales cycle typically begins with an extended evaluation and test period  also known as qualification  during which our products undergo rigorous reliability testing by our customers 
qualification is typically followed by an extended development period by our customers and an additional three to nine month period before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
this lengthy sales cycle creates the risk that our customers will decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our integrated circuits prior to completion  which makes it even more difficult to forecast customer demand 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to  if at all 
as a result  we would hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
in addition  any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
we must keep pace with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and evolving industry standards 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards and technologies 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will 
table of contents be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge which we do not properly anticipate  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
in addition  our target markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the markets they serve and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross margin 
the products we develop and sell are primarily used for high volume applications 
as a result  the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly 
we may not be able to maintain or improve the gross margins and our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our efficiency through reducing our costs or developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross margin 
additionally  because we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  and our costs may even increase  which could also reduce our gross margin 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
we expect that we will have to do so again in the future 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundry subcontractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that the foundries that we use will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our existing foundry relationships or develop new ones 
if we or any of our foundry subcontractors experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  we could experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses  all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products  however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  if at all 
moreover  even if we are able to achieve higher levels of design integration  such integration may have a short term adverse impact on our results of operations  as we may reduce our revenue by integrating the functionality of multiple chips into a single chip 

table of contents as a result of our global operations  we face foreign business  political  economic and exchange rate risks  which may harm our results of operations  because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states and  as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
all of our products are manufactured outside of the united states 
our current qualified integrated circuit foundries are located in the same region within taiwan  and our primary assembly and test subcontractors are located in the pacific rim region 
in addition  many of our customers are located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  which further exposes us to foreign risks 
sales to customers located in asia represented approximately of our net revenue in fiscal  of our net revenue in fiscal  and of our net revenue in fiscal we have substantial operations  including approximately of our workforce as of january   in israel 
these operations are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
any potential hostilities involving or within israel could disrupt these operations 
for example  past hostilities between israel and the palestinian authority and other groups have caused substantial political unrest  which could lead to a potential economic downturn in israel 
we anticipate that our manufacturing  assembly  testing and sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our operations and revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with international operations  including political  social and economic instability  including wars  terrorism  other hostilities and political unrest  boycotts  curtailment of trade and other business restrictions  compliance with domestic and foreign export and import regulations  and difficulties in obtaining and complying with domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses  compliance with foreign laws  and laws and practices that favor local companies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  trade restrictions or higher tariffs  transportation delays  difficulties of managing distributors  especially because we expect to continue to increase our sales through international distributors  less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the united states or other developed countries  and inadequate local infrastructure 
moreover  the international nature of our business subjects us to risk associated with the fluctuation of the us dollar versus foreign currencies 
decreases in the value of the us dollar versus currencies in jurisdictions where we have large fixed costs or our third party manufacturers have significant cost will increase the cost of such operations  which could harm our results of operations 
for example  we have large fixed costs in israel  which will become greater if the us dollar declines in value versus the israeli shekel 
on the other hand  all of our sales have been denominated in us dollars 

table of contents we have had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in prior fiscal years 
although we believe we have taken the necessary actions to strengthen the weaknesses in our control structure  we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be filed on a timely basis and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could lead to a decline in our stock price 
we believe that effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires management and our auditors to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistake and errors discovered by personnel within control systems may not be properly disclosed and addressed 
controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
in addition  we are consistently evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls  a process which sometimes leads to modifications in such controls 
these modifications could affect the overall effectiveness or evaluation of the control system in the future by us or our independent registered public accounting firm 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments  which could divert management s attention  cause ownership dilution to our shareholders  be difficult to integrate and adversely affect our results of operations and share price 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products and technologies  augment our market segment coverage  or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition  investment  alliance or joint venture opportunities in the future  or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions or relationships will be successful 
integrating newly acquired businesses or technologies typically entails many risks that could put a strain on our resources  could be costly and time consuming  and might not be successful 
in addition  any acquisitions could materially harm our results of operations or liquidity as a result of either the issuance of dilutive equity securities or payment of cash 
moreover  such acquisitions could divert our management s attention from other business concerns and also result in customer dissatisfaction 
in addition  we might lose key employees of the newly acquired organizations during the acquisition process 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 

table of contents we are exposed to potential impairment charges on certain assets 
over the past several years  we have made several acquisitions 
as a result of these acquisitions  we had approximately billion of goodwill and million of intangible assets on our balance sheet as of january  under gaap  we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we perform an assessment of goodwill at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter and we also assess the impairment of goodwill on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the businesses acquired fail to meet our expectations set out at the time of the acquisition or if our market capitalization adjusted for control premiums and other factors declines to below our carrying value  we could incur significant goodwill or intangible impairment charges  which could negatively impact our financial results 
for example  as a result of our analysis related to acquired intangible assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter ended january  in addition  from time to time  we have made investments in other private companies 
if the companies that we invest in are unable to execute their plans and succeed in their respective markets  we may not benefit from such investments  and we could potentially lose the amounts we invest 
we evaluate our investment portfolio on a regular basis to determine if impairments have occurred 
impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations in any period 
changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse effects on our financial results 
changes in financial accounting standards or practices or changes in existing taxation rules or practices may have a significant effect on our reported results 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
for example  the us congress is considering legislation affecting the taxation of foreign corporations and such legislation if enacted might adversely affect our future tax liabilities and have a material impact on our results of operations 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices by regulators may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
tax benefits that we receive may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
over the course of the past several years  we have entered into agreements with the local governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we have significant operations to provide us with favorable tax rates in those jurisdictions if certain criteria are met 
we obtained from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempt undertakings tax protection act  as amended  an undertaking that  in the event that bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on income and capital gains  those taxes should not apply to us until march  the economic development board of singapore the edb granted pioneer status to our wholly owned subsidiary in singapore in july this tax exemption was to expire after ten years  but the edb in june agreed to extend the term to years 
as a result  we anticipate that a significant portion of the income we earn in singapore during this period will be exempt from the singapore income tax 
we are required to meet several requirements as to investment  headcount and activities in singapore to retain this status 
due to the economic downturn in fiscal  we came to an agreement to amend the pioneer conditions for future years and preserve the year tax exemption status 
under the israeli law of approved or benefited enterprise  two branches  marvell israel misl and marvell dspc  are entitled to a beneficial tax program that includes reduced tax rates and exemption of certain income 
the first program was approved for misl in and the most recent was approved in marvell dspc has five approved programs with the first approved in and the most recent in the benefit 
table of contents period is generally ten to fifteen years and begins in the first year in which our israeli branches earn taxable income from the approved or benefited enterprises  provided the maximum period has not elapsed 
income from the approved or benefited enterprises is subject to reduced tax rates ranging between and or tax exemptions for fiscal years through during fiscal  our switzerland subsidiary received a ten year federal and cantonal tax holiday on revenues from research and design and wafer supply trading activities that will expire in if certain requirements are not met in the initial five year period  our incentive exemption would be reduced by on the next five year period of the tax holiday  which would adversely affect our financial results 
if any of our tax arrangements in these foreign jurisdictions were terminated  our financial results could be harmed 
changes in our management may cause uncertainty in  or be disruptive to  our business 
we have experienced significant changes in our management and our board of directors in recent years 
for example  in june  we hired a new chief financial officer and in october  we hired a new general counsel 
since october  our chief financial officer has also served as our interim chief operating officer  and we have reassigned many of the duties that had previously been allocated to the chief operating officer to other employees 
in light of our current operating structure and effectiveness  our board of directors has reevaluated whether we need a chief operating officer and determined that appointing a permanent chief operating officer at this time is not necessary 
thus  we have suspended our search for a permanent chief operating officer 
in addition  three of the independent directors currently on our board of directors joined the board in or subsequent to october  and in april  an independent director was appointed to a new position of lead independent director 
although we will endeavor to implement any director and management transition in as non disruptive a manner as possible  any such transition might impact our business  and give rise to uncertainty among customers  investors  vendors  employees and others concerning our future direction and performance 
this could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and our ability to execute our business model could be impaired 
we depend on key personnel to manage our business  and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel  our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of key employees or the inability to attract qualified personnel  including engineers  sales and marketing personnel could delay the development and introduction of and harm our ability to sell our products 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key technical personnel  and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
the competition for qualified technical personnel with significant experience in the design  development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of integrated circuits is intense 
it is important that we are able to identify  hire and retain engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacture of products based on analog technology 
our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the source of our technological and product innovations 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner 
two of our officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock  and  together with another employee who is also a significant shareholder  are related by blood or marriage 
these factors may allow the officers and directors as a group or the three related employees to influence the election of directors and the approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions 
dr 
sehat sutardja  our president and chief executive officer  and weili dai  who serves as the vice president of sales for communications and consumer business of msi and vice president and general manager 
table of contents of communications and computing business unit of msi  are husband and wife  and dr 
sehat sutardja and dr 
pantas sutardja  our vice president  chief technology officer and chief research and development officer  are brothers 
together  these three individuals held approximately of our outstanding common shares as of january  as a result  if these individuals act together  they may influence the election of our directors and the approval or disapproval of any significant corporate actions that require shareholder approval 
this influence over our affairs might be adverse to the interests of other shareholders 
for instance  the voting power of these individuals could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of us on terms that other shareholders may desire 
furthermore  we have a classified board  which could further delay or prevent an acquisition  under certain circumstances 
under bermuda law  all of our officers  in exercising their powers and discharging their duties  must act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and exercise the care  diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances 
majority shareholders do not owe fiduciary duties to minority shareholders 
as a result  the minority shareholders will not have a direct claim against the majority shareholders in the event the majority shareholders take actions that damage the interests of minority shareholders 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda  except that bermuda courts would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in our name if the directors or officers are alleged to be acting beyond our corporate power  committing illegal acts or violating our memorandum of association or second amended and restated bye laws 
furthermore  consideration would be given by a bermuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or  for instance  where an act requiring the approval of a greater percentage of the company s shareholders than those who actually approved it 
the companies act of bermuda  as amended  provides that when one or more shareholders believes the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner which is prejudicial to the interest of some of the shareholders  a bermuda court  upon petition  may make such order as it sees fit  including an order regulating the conduct of the company s affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or by the company  and in the case of a purchase of the shares by the company  for the reduction accordingly of the company s capital or otherwise 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  which would negatively affect our ability to compete 
we believe one of our key competitive advantages results from our collection of proprietary technologies that we have developed since our inception 
if we fail to protect these intellectual property rights  competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed that could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenues 
we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and business partners  and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
we have been issued several us and foreign patents and have a number of pending us and foreign patent applications 
however  a patent may not be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or proprietary technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and the steps that we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours  which would adversely impact our business 
certain of our software as well as that of our customers may be derived from so called open source software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and or other third parties 
such open source 
table of contents software is often made available under licenses  such as the gnu general public license which impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software 
these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public  and or license such derivative works under a particular type of license  rather than the forms of license customarily used to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  there is little or no legal precedent for interpreting the terms of certain of these open source licenses  including the determination of which works are subject to the terms of such licenses 
while we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software  in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work  we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and or stop distribution of that work 
we may become involved with costly and lengthy litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property  which could subject us to liability  require us to indemnify our customers  require us to obtain or renew licenses  stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products 
litigation involving patents and other intellectual property is widespread in the high technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the semiconductor industry  where a number of companies and other entities aggressively bring numerous infringement claims to assert their patent portfolios 
from time to time our subsidiaries and customers receive  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that allege claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
for example  in recent years  multiple claims have been made against our subsidiaries and our customers related to standards based technologies such as wireless lan 
in addition  we have had certain patent licenses with third parties that have not been renewed  and if we cannot successfully renew these licenses  our subsidiaries and customers could face claims of infringement 
these claims could result in litigation and or claims for indemnification  which  in turn  could subject us to significant liability for damages  attorneys fees and costs 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  offering for sale  making  having made or exporting products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property  limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for us  pay substantial damages and or license fees and or royalties to the party claiming infringement that could adversely impact our liquidity or operating results  attempt to obtain or renew licenses to the relevant intellectual property  which licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
in addition  many of our contracts with our customers require us to indemnify our customers products against claims alleging infringement of the proprietary rights of other parties 
we have agreed to indemnify select customers for claims made against our products  where such claims allege infringement of third party intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  patents  registered trademarks  and or copyrights 
for example  customers have requested us to indemnify them in connection with patent infringement lawsuits filed in texas by australia s commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro  which alleged its asserted patent is essential to the wireless standard 
we have filed an action  also in texas  against csiro seeking a declaratory judgment that csiro s patent is invalid and unenforceable and that we and our customers do not infringe the csiro patent 
we believe our products do not infringe any valid and enforceable claims of the asserted patents in these litigations under an appropriate construction of these patents claims and we will vigorously defend ourselves in these matters 

table of contents we have been named as a party to several lawsuits and we may be named in additional litigation in the future  all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and the trading price for our securities 
we have been named as a party to several lawsuits and we may be named in additional litigation in the future 
please refer to note commitments and contingencies contingencies of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for a more detailed description of a number of the litigation matters we are currently engaged in 
under certain circumstances  we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors and officers for these lawsuits 
in addition  due to the high volatility of our stock price  we may be vulnerable to securities class action litigation 
the ultimate outcome of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive  and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the defense of these lawsuits may result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business 
in the event we were to receive an unfavorable outcome in any lawsuit  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price of our securities may be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the settlement with the sec  we cannot invoke the safe harbor for the forward looking statements provision of the private securities litigation reform act of for three years following the entry of judgment 
on may   we announced that we had reached an agreement with the sec that concluded the sec s formal investigation of us with respect to our historic stock option granting practices 
as a result of our sec settlement  we have forfeited for three years following the entry of judgment  or june   the ability to invoke the safe harbor for the forward looking statements provision of the private securities litigation reform act of this safe harbor provided us enhanced protection from liability related to forward looking statements if the forward looking statements were either accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements or were made without actual knowledge that they were false or misleading 
without the statutory safe harbor  it may be more difficult for us to defend against any claims based on forward looking statements 
if the recent weakness in credit market conditions continues or increases  it could have a material adverse impact on our investment portfolio 
us sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets  causing global credit and liquidity issues 
the short term funding markets experienced credit issues beginning in the second half of calendar leading to liquidity disruption in the auction rate securities market and certain asset backed commercial paper 
we hold auction rate securities in our portfolio  and if the global credit market continues to deteriorate  our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
for additional details on our auction rate securities  please see part ii  item a 
in addition  to support our international operations  a portion of our cash and investment portfolio is held offshore 
while these amounts are primarily invested in us dollars  a portion is held in foreign currencies  and all offshore balances are exposed to local political  banking  currency control and other risks 
certain of these amounts may also be subject to tax and other restrictions on their transfer to the us or other countries 
while we believe our cash and investments are secure  there is risk that some of our balances in international locations will not be adequately secured if the current credit crisis continues 

table of contents we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business  and the failure of any critical information system  may result in serious harm to our business 
we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business 
these information systems include telecommunications  the internet  our corporate intranet  various computer hardware and software applications  network communications and e mail 
these information systems are subject to attacks  failures and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses  destructive or inadequate code  power failures  and physical damage to computers  communication lines and networking equipment 
to the extent that these information systems are under our control  we have implemented security procedures  such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes  to address the outlined risks 
while we believe that our information systems are appropriately controlled and that we have processes in place to adequately manage these risks  security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
our us headquarters located in santa clara  california  and our buildings in singapore  penang  malaysia  etoy  switzerland and shanghai  china subject us to the risks of owning real property  which include the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic and other legal or regulatory requirements  the potential disruption of our business and operations arising from or connected with a relocation due to moving to or renovating the facility  increased cash commitments for improvements to the buildings or the property or both  increased operating expenses for the buildings or the property or both  possible disputes with tenants or other third parties related to the buildings or the property or both  and the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance  or uninsured risks  such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of earthquakes  floods and or other natural disasters 
as we carry only limited insurance coverage  any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents  and we do not have coverage for certain losses 
we believe our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practice and economic and availability considerations 
however  if our insurance coverage is inadequate to protect us against unforeseen catastrophic losses  any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are incorporated in bermuda  and  as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
in addition  our bye laws contain a waiver of claims or rights of action by our shareholders against our officers and directors  which will severely limit our shareholders right to assert a claim against our officers and directors under bermuda law 
we are organized under the laws of bermuda 
as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to effect service of process within the united states upon us  or to enforce against us in united states courts 
table of contents judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
there is significant doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state or hear actions brought in bermuda against us or those persons based on those laws 
the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not based solely on united states federal or state securities laws  would not be automatically enforceable in bermuda 
our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers and directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties with or for us  other than with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director 
this waiver will limit the rights of our shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act complained of involves actual fraud or dishonesty 
thus  so long as acts of business judgment do not involve actual fraud or dishonesty  they will not be subject to shareholder claims under bermuda law 
for example  shareholders will not have claims against officers and directors for a breach of trust  unless the breach rises to the level of actual fraud or dishonesty 
our bye laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in corporate control  even if the change in corporate control would benefit our shareholders 
our bye laws contain change in corporate control provisions  which include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  and requiring a vote of two thirds of the outstanding shares to approve any change of corporate control in the event the action is not approved by at least of the directors holding office at the date of the board meeting to approve the action 
these change in corporate control provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be a benefit to our shareholders
