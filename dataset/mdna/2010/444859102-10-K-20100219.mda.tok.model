item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview headquartered in louisville  kentucky  humana is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies  based on our revenues of approximately billion 
we are a full service benefits solutions company  offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit products for employer groups  government benefit programs  and individuals 
as of december   we had approximately million members in our medical benefit plans  as well as approximately million members in our specialty products 
we manage our business with two segments government and commercial 
the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs  and includes three lines of business medicare  military  and medicaid 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals 
when identifying our segments  we aggregated products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing  benefits  and underwriting requirements 
these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other revenue  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks  in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
our results are impacted by many factors  but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium  aso fee  and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs 
benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces  including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures  new prescription drugs and therapies  an aging population  lifestyle challenges including diet and smoking  the tort liability system  and government regulation 
our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance 
the benefit ratio  which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues  represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability 
the selling  general  and administrative expense ratio  or sg a expense ratio  which is computed by taking total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues  administrative services fees and other revenues  represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 
proposed health insurance initiatives the president of the united states and members of the us congress have proposed significant reforms to the us health care system 
in november  the us house of representatives passed the affordable health care for america act and in december the us senate passed the patient protection and affordable care act  which we refer to collectively as the acts 
while there are significant differences between the two acts  they include  for example  limiting medicare advantage payment rates  mandatory issuance of insurance coverage  requirements that would limit the ability of health plans and insurers to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk  stipulating annual rebates to enrollees if the amount of premium revenues expended on medical costs falls below prescribed ratios for group and individual health insurance coverage  and imposing new non deductible taxes on health insurers increasing in the aggregate from billion to billion annually over ten years 
in addition  certain members of congress have proposed a single payer health care system  a government health insurance option to compete with private plans  and other expanded public health care measures 
various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
because of the 
table of contents unsettled nature of these initiatives and the numerous steps required to implement them  we cannot predict what health insurance initiatives  if any  will be implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on our business 
however  legislative changes  if enacted  may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations  including lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the non deductible excise tax  financial position  including goodwill recoverability  and cash flows 
government segment our strategy and commitment to the medicare programs has led to significant growth 
medicare advantage membership increased to  members at december   up  members  or from  members at december   primarily due to sales of preferred provider organization  or ppo products 
average medicare advantage membership increased in compared to  including the impact from the acquisitions of cariten  metcare  osf  and securehorizons  discussed below 
likewise  medicare advantage premium revenues have increased to billion for from billion for recently the mix of sales has shifted increasingly to our network based ppo offerings  which is particularly important given the enactment of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of  or the act  discussed more fully below 
medicare advantage members enrolled in network based products was approximately at december  compared to at december   with our ppo membership increasing from december  to december  medicare advantage members enrolled in network based products increased to approximately in january we expect medicare advantage membership to increase by  to  members  or approximately to  in due to the enactment of the act in july  beginning in  sponsors of medicare advantage private fee for service  or pffs  plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks  except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two network based medicare advantage plans 
we have  pffs members  or approximately of our total medicare advantage membership at december   down from at december  approximately of our pffs members at december  resided in geographies where we have developed a provider network and offer a networked plan 
we are continuing to implement various operational and strategic initiatives  including further developing our networks and building network based plan offerings to address the adequate network requirement 
we anticipate these initiatives  together with certain counties exemption from the network requirement  to result in more than of our pffs members having the choice of remaining in a humana plan in final medicare advantage rates were announced by cms on april   with an effective rate decrease for the industry of to 
based on information available at the time we filed our bids in june  we believe we have effectively designed medicare advantage products that address the lower rates while continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original medicare with a supplement policy as well as other medicare advantage competitors within our industry 
in addition  we will continue to pursue our cost reduction and outcome enhancing strategies  including care coordination and disease management  to mitigate the adverse effects of this rate reduction on our medicare advantage members 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute operational and strategic initiatives with respect to changes in the medicare advantage program 
failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
we also offer medicare stand alone prescription drug plans  or pdps  under the medicare part d program 
these plans provide varying degrees of coverage 
in order to offer these plans in a given year  in june of the preceding year we must submit bids to cms for approval 
during  we experienced prescription drug claim expenses for our medicare stand alone pdps that were higher than we had originally assumed in the bid that we submitted to cms in june these higher claim levels for our medicare stand alone pdps reflected a combination of several variances between our actuarial bid assumptions versus our experience 
these variances resulted from  among other things  differences between the actuarial utilization assumptions which are our attempts to predict members future utilization of drugs in the bids for one of our plans versus our actual claims 
table of contents experience in  as well as an increase in the percentage of higher cost members 
these issues were addressed for based on enhancements made to our bid development and review processes 
our medicare stand alone pdp membership declined to  members at december   down  members  or  from december   resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand alone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience 
these actions also resulted in a substantial decline in our stand alone pdp benefit ratio for compared to we expect medicare stand alone pdp membership to decrease by  to  members  or approximately to  in as we continue to price and design benefits to correspond with our historical experience 
our quarterly government segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership 
the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member s cumulative out of pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member s plan period which begins annually on january for renewals 
these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages 
as a result  the government segment s benefit ratio generally improves as the year progresses 
in addition  the number of low income senior members as well as year over year changes in the mix of membership in our stand alone pdp products affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 
our military services business primarily consists of the tricare south region contract which covers benefits for healthcare services provided to beneficiaries through march  on december   we were notified by department of defense tricare management activity  or tma  that it intends to exercise its options to extend the tricare south region contract for option period vii and option period viii 
the exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the tricare south region contract through march  in july  we were notified by the department of defense that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids 
we filed a protest with the government accountability office  or gao  in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection 
in october  we learned that the gao had upheld our protest  determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region 
on december   we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao s decision with respect to our protest 
at this time  we are not able to determine what actions tma will take in response to recommendations by the gao  nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 
for  premiums and aso fees associated with the tricare south region contract were billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
we are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill  which had a carrying value of million at december   potential exit costs  possible asset sales  and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses 
goodwill was not impaired at december  commercial segment commercial segment pretax earnings  impacted by the economic recession and the highly competitive environment partially offset by higher investment income  decreased by million  or  for compared to commercial segment medical membership at december  of  decreased  members  or from december  the decline in membership primarily was a result of the impact of the economic recession  including the loss of two larger aso accounts 
the economic recession has led to increased in group member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels primarily through reductions of less experienced workers 
as a result  we experienced higher utilization of benefits  mainly in our fully insured group accounts  primarily due to the shift in the mix of members to an older workforce having more health care needs  as well as members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs  members 
table of contents seeking to maximize their benefits once their deductibles are met  and increased cobra participation 
the membership declines were partially offset by enrollment gains in our individual product  a strategic area of commercial growth 
individual membership at december  increased from december  this increase in individual membership  together with administrative costs associated with increased business for our mail order pharmacy  led to a higher commercial segment sg a expense ratio 
we expect commercial segment medical membership to decline by  to  members in financial position at december   cash  cash equivalents and our investment securities totaled billion  or of total assets  with of the billion invested in cash and cash equivalents 
investment securities consist of debt securities of investment grade quality with an average credit rating by s p of aa at december  and an average duration of approximately years 
including cash and cash equivalents  the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately years 
we had million of mortgage backed securities associated with alt a or subprime loans at december  and no collateralized debt obligations 
our net unrealized position improved million from a net unrealized loss position of million at december  to a net unrealized gain position of million at december  gross unrealized losses were million at december  compared to million at december  gross unrealized gains were million at december  compared to million at december  all issuers of securities we own trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments 
we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased 
as of december   we do not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized costs basis  and as a result  we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss are not other than temporarily impaired as of december  during  we recognized other than temporary impairments of million of which million resulted from investments in lehman brothers holdings inc  or lehman  or its subsidiaries 
lehman and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in the other impairments primarily relate to declines in values of securities  primarily associated with the financial services industry 
of the million  million was allocated to the government segment and million was allocated to the commercial segment 
there were no material other than temporary impairments in we continuously review our investment portfolios 
there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other than temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 
in addition  in the fall of we terminated all fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements outstanding associated with our senior notes based on recent changes in the credit market environment 
in exchange for terminating these interest rate swap agreements  we received cash of million representing the fair value of the swap assets 
this transaction also fixed the interest rate on our senior notes to a weighted average rate of 
we may re enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors 
we believe our cash balances  investment securities  operating cash flows  and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements  future expansion opportunities  and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future  as well as to refinance or repay debt 
our long term debt  consisting primarily of senior notes  of  million represented of total capitalization at december   declining from at december  the earliest maturity of our senior notes is in june we have available a year  billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in july as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement 

table of contents certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends  loans  or other cash transfers to humana inc  our parent company  and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus 
in most states  prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 
in  our subsidiaries paid dividends of million to the parent compared to million in in addition  the parent made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of million in compared to million in based on the statutory financial statements as of december   we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of billion in our state regulated subsidiaries  billion above the aggregate billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states 
other highlights earnings increased to per diluted common share in from per diluted common share in  primarily reflecting substantially lower stand alone pdp claims expenses 
cash flows from operations increased million to  million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from increased earnings associated with lower stand alone pdp prescription drug claims 
we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  including the primary factors that accounted for those changes
