references to comparable store sales amounts within the following discussion include sales for all stores operating for a period of at least full months  including remodeled and expanded stores  but excluding store relocations and stores that have undergone format changes 
comparable store sales results for fiscal were calculated based on the week period ended january  fiscal compared to fiscal net income attributable to holdings shareholders we recorded net income attributable to holdings shareholders of million per diluted share for fiscal and million per diluted share in fiscal our results for fiscal and were affected by a number of significant items 
our net income  as adjusted for these significant items was million per diluted share for fiscal and million per diluted share for fiscal the increase in net income for the year reflects an increase in operating income of million  primarily due to a decline in selling and administrative expenses and the below noted significant items  partially offset by a decline in gross margin dollars 

table of contents in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap  we use certain non gaap measures in assessing our operating performance 
we believe gaap measures as adjusted serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of our business and we adjust incentive compensation metrics for our executive management team for these same items 
furthermore  we believe our use of gaap measures as adjusted  including diluted income per share as adjusted  provides an appropriate measure to use in assessing our performance across periods  given that this measure provides an adjustment for certain significant items  the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on the earnings we report for a given period 
accordingly  we consider the aggregate impact of these items  along with reported results  in reviewing and evaluating our financial performance 
however  we do not  and do not recommend that you solely use gaap measures as adjusted to assess our financial performance or to formulate investment decisions  as the measures may exclude a number of important cash and non cash recurring items

the decrease in interest income in fiscal was primarily due to lower yields received on short term investments during the year  as well as lower average cash balances throughout the year 
interest expense we incurred million in interest expense during fiscal and million in fiscal while our total debt balances declined throughout the year  our interest expense was flat to fiscal primarily due to an increase in amortization expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs related to our amended revolving credit facility

total net mark to market and settlement losses of million were recorded on these transactions in fiscal total net gains of million were recorded on these transactions in fiscal see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these transactions 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in our tax rate is primarily due to the resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters during  which resulted in the recording of a million tax benefit 
income tax expense in included a benefit of million related to the resolution of certain tax matters  but was higher mainly due to a portion of our impairment charge for goodwill in fiscal not being deductible for tax purposes 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net income attributable to holdings shareholders net income attributable to holdings shareholders was million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended january  and million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended february  our results for fiscal and were affected by a number of significant items 
our net income  as adjusted for these significant items  was million per diluted share for fiscal and million per diluted share for fiscal the decrease in net income in fiscal reflects a decrease in operating income of billion  primarily due to lower operating income at kmart and sears domestic  as well as slightly lower operating income at sears canada  and the above noted significant items 
the decrease in net income was also due to lower interest and investment income  partially offset by lower income tax expense 
declines in the operating results of sears domestic and kmart in were primarily the result of a decline in gross margin across most major merchandise categories  reflecting both sales declines  as well as an overall decline in our gross margin rate for fiscal gross margin rate declined due to increased markdowns taken across most merchandise categories and reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs 
during  we made a concerted effort to reduce our inventory levels due to the deterioration of the economic climate in the latter half of and what we anticipated to be a higher risk environment in total revenues and comparable store sales total revenues were billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal the decline in revenues of billion was primarily due to a billion decline at sears domestic  a billion decline at kmart  and a million decline at sears canada  which included a decrease of million related to the impact of exchange rates during fiscal exchange rates did not have as significant an impact on the results of sears canada in as compared to  as rates were less volatile 
the decrease in fiscal revenues was primarily due to the impact of lower comparable store sales at kmart and sears domestic 
fiscal domestic comparable store sales were down in the aggregate  with sears domestic declining and kmart declining 
in fiscal  declines were experienced across most major merchandise categories 
comparable store sales declines at sears domestic were primarily driven by declines recorded in the apparel  tools and lawn and garden categories  and to a lesser degree by declines in the home appliances and household goods categories 
comparable store sales declines at kmart were driven by declines recorded within the apparel and home categories 
we believe the overall decline in comparable store sales in fiscal reflected the negative impact of certain external economic factors 
gross margin gross margin declined from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal the decline of billion was mainly attributable to lower gross margin dollars generated at both kmart and sears domestic as a result of the above noted sales declines  as well as a decline in the gross margin rate 
fiscal gross margin also includes a charge of million recorded in cost of sales for margin related expenses taken in connection with store closings announced during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
our gross margin rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the basis point decline consisted of a basis point decline at sears domestic and a basis point decline at kmart  partially offset by an increase of basis points at sears canada 
our buying and occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature  and therefore did not decrease as much as sales decreased during reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs  given lower overall sales levels in fiscal  accounted for approximately basis points of the total decline in our gross margin rate in fiscal 
table of contents the remaining basis point decline was primarily the result of a decline in gross margin rate at sears domestic  which declined mainly due to increased markdown activity across most merchandise categories 
the impact of increased markdowns on sears domestic throughout fiscal was somewhat mitigated by fewer markdowns taken in the seasonal and winter apparel category during the fourth quarter of as our purchases of merchandise were more consistent with the sales trends 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million to billion during fiscal the decrease includes a million reduction in payroll and benefits expense  as well as a million reduction in advertising expense

fiscal selling and administrative expenses include a million curtailment gain recorded in connection with changes made to sears canada s benefit plans and a million gain related to insurance recoveries for certain sears domestic properties damaged by hurricanes during fiscal our selling and administrative expense rate was in fiscal and for fiscal while we took a number of actions to decrease our expenses during  the selling and administrative expense rate increased  primarily reflecting lower expense leverage resulting from lower overall sales levels 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million to million during fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to additional property and equipment becoming fully depreciated during the year  thereby decreasing our depreciable asset base 
impairment charges in accordance with accounting standards governing the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed an impairment test of certain of our long lived assets principally the value of buildings and other fixed assets associated with our stores due to events and changes in circumstances during the third quarter of that indicated an impairment might have occurred 
the impairment review was triggered by the increased severity of the economic turmoil and weakening in the us economy during the third quarter of  which had a negative impact on the performance of our stores 
as a result of this review  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of fiscal this impairment charge includes a charge for the stores that we decided to close in the third quarter and early fourth quarter of we also recorded a million impairment charge related to the property and equipment at stores we decided to close in january during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets pursuant to accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of our tests  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the fair value of goodwill associated with our osh subsidiary 
accounting standards require interim tests for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets be performed should indicators of such an impairment arise as a result of changes in existing business conditions

if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
as a result of impairment analysis  we determined that the entire amount of goodwill recorded at sears domestic s subsidiary  osh  was impaired and recorded a charge of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairment charges 
operating income loss sears domestic recorded an operating loss of million in fiscal and operating income of million in fiscal  a decline of billion 
in addition to the significant items noted above  the decline in operating income primarily reflects lower total gross margin dollars generated as a result of lower overall sales levels and a decline in gross margin rate  partially offset by a reduction in selling and administrative expenses

table of contents operating income sears canada s operating income decreased million to million in fiscal the decrease in operating income includes a million decline due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and reflects the above noted decreases in sales  gross margin and selling and administrative expenses 
in addition  sears canada benefited from a million gain on the sale of its calgary downtown full line store during fiscal analysis of consolidated financial condition cash balances cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
our cash and cash equivalents balances as of the fiscal years ended january  and january  are detailed in the following table 
millions january  january  domestic cash and equivalents cash posted as collateral credit card deposits in transit total domestic cash and cash equivalents sears canada total cash and cash equivalents restricted cash total cash balances we had total cash balances of billion at january  and billion at january  the increase in cash and cash equivalents from january  primarily reflects an increase in net operating cash flows generated during fiscal due to increased income and increased cash generated from working capital balances 
primary uses of cash for fiscal included repayments of million on total outstanding debt balances  million for share repurchases  capital expenditures of million  and contributions to our pension and post retirement benefit plans of million 
our invested cash may include  from time to time  investments in  but not limited to  commercial paper  us federal  state and municipal government securities  floating rate notes  repurchase agreements and money market funds 
cash amounts held in these short term investments are readily available to us and included million and million as of fiscal year end and fiscal year end  respectively  invested in support of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
credit card deposits in transit include deposits in transit from banks for payments related to third party credit card and debit card transactions 
restricted cash consists of cash related to sears canada s cash balances  which have been pledged as collateral for letters of credit obligations issued under its offshore merchandise purchasing program and with counterparties related to outstanding derivative contracts  as well as funds held in trust in accordance with regulatory requirements governing advance ticket sales related to sears canada s travel business 
our january  cash balance excluded million on deposit with the reserve primary fund  a money market fund that temporarily suspended withdrawals while it liquidated its holdings to generate cash to 
table of contents distribute 
as a result  we reclassified million from cash to the prepaid expenses and other current assets line within our consolidated balance sheet at january  we classify outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit within other current liabilities and reduce cash balances when these checks clear the bank on which they were drawn 
outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit were million and million for the fiscal year ended and  respectively 
investment of available capital since the merger  we have generated significant operating cash flows  and management expects that our cash flows will continue to exceed our annual operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we have and will continue to invest in our businesses to improve the customer experience and provide the opportunity for attractive returns 
further  as of january   we have repurchased approximately billion of our common shares since the merger and may continue to repurchase shares subject to market conditions and board authorization 
in addition  we may pursue investments in the form of acquisitions  joint ventures and partnerships where we believe appropriate returns can be obtained 
further  we may determine under certain market conditions that available capital is best utilized to fund investments that we believe offer us attractive return opportunities  whether or not related to our ongoing business activities 
our board of directors has delegated authority to direct investment of our surplus cash to our chairman  edward s 
lampert  subject to various limitations that have been or may be from time to time adopted by the board of directors and or finance committee of the board of directors 
during fiscal  we invested a portion of our surplus cash in various securities and financial instruments  including total return swaps  which are derivative instruments that synthetically replicate the economic return characteristics of one or more underlying marketable equity securities 
we had no investments in total return swaps during fiscal years or operating activities and cash flows holdings generated billion in operating cash flows during fiscal and million in fiscal as a retailer  holdings primary source of operating cash flows is the sales of goods and services to customers  while the primary use of cash in operations is to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories 
the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal is mainly the result of increases in cash from these sources of working capital  as well as increased net income 
our cash flow from operations was partially offset by the purchase of insurance coverage for workers compensation claims in the second and fourth quarters of we use a combination of third party insurance and self insurance for our insurable risks 
during  we paid million to purchase insurance coverage for certain of our workers compensation risks from fiscal and years prior 
the insurance allowed us to limit our risk for these workers compensation matters  although we are not indemnified from liability for these matters 
accordingly  the payments were recorded as deposits 
these transactions also allowed us to reduce the amount of letters of credit used as collateral for our insurance programs by million 
the premium payments associated with these transactions are reported as cash used in operating activities 
holdings generated million in operating cash flows during fiscal and billion in fiscal the decrease in net operating cash flows generated during fiscal primarily reflects lower income  partially offset by an increase in cash generated from inventory reductions during the year 
merchandise inventories declined million to billion at january  from billion at january  inventory levels at sears canada increased million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
merchandise payables were billion at january  and billion as of january  the increase in merchandise payables is reflective of improved cash management in fiscal 
table of contents investing activities and cash flows net cash flows used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash used in investing activities in all three years was primarily used for purchases of property and equipment 
we spent million on capital expenditures during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal included investments in information technology and infrastructure for the stores and distribution centers 
capital expenditures during fiscal included ongoing investments in the maintenance of the company s facilities including a significant investment in lighting retrofit projects to reduce energy consumption in holdings facilities and in information technology 
capital expenditures during fiscal included multiple real estate acquisitions of space used for holdings retail locations or distribution centers and for continued investments in our information technology 
we anticipate fiscal capital expenditure levels to increase  as compared to levels  due to investment in information technology upgrades and ongoing investment in the infrastructure of our facilities  however  it should be noted that in the normal course of business  we consider opportunities to purchase leased operating properties  as well as offers to sell owned  or assign leased  operating and non operating properties 
these transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  result in material proceeds or outlays of cash and cause our capital expenditure levels to vary from period to period 
in addition  we review leases that will expire in the short term in order to determine the appropriate action to take with respect to them 
during fiscal and  we purchased and previously leased operating properties for million and million  respectively 
we did not make any such purchases in fiscal during fiscal  we received million in cash from changes in investments and restricted cash 
this reflects cash received from the reserve primary fund of million  as well as changes in restricted cash requirements at sears canada 
during fiscal  we purchased an additional million of sears canada s common shares in open market transactions 
we paid a total of million for the additional shares acquired 
this transaction is further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in the results of operations and investment of available capital sections above  we entered into total return swaps during fiscal in connection with the settlement of our investments in total return swaps during  collateral posted in the amount of million in was returned to us in there were no total return swaps outstanding as of january  or january  we purchased million shares of common stock of restoration hardware  inc restoration  a specialty retailer of hardware  bathware  furniture  lighting  textiles  accessories and gifts during our investment of million represented an ownership interest of of restoration s total outstanding shares 
we sold our investment in restoration during the second quarter of fiscal financing activities and cash flows net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in and billion in the difference primarily reflects common share repurchase activity and debt repayments during the three year period 
we repurchased million  million and billion of our common stock pursuant to our common share repurchase program in fiscal  and  respectively 
the common share repurchase program was initially announced in with a total authorization by our board of directors of up to billion 
during the period from fiscal through fiscal  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional billion of common stock  for a total authorization since inception of the program of billion 
at january   we had approximately million of remaining authorization 
table of contents under the program 
the share repurchase program has no stated expiration date and share repurchases may be implemented using a variety of methods  which may include open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  block trades  accelerated share repurchase transactions  the purchase of call options  the sale of put options or otherwise  or by any combination of such methods 
repayments of debt  when netted with new borrowings during  were million 
total short term borrowings at january  of million were million lower than our level of borrowings at january  the decrease in outstanding long term debt includes a reduction in domestic long term debt and capital lease obligations of million 
long term debt of the parent at january  which excludes the debt of our sears canada million and orchard supply hardware million subsidiaries  which is non recourse to the parent is less than billion  with no significant required repayments until payments on our debt  when netted with new borrowings during  were nominal 
fiscal financing cash flows included debt payments of million  net of new borrowings 
while we decreased our total amount of short term borrowings in fiscal  we also altered the mix of our funding to include more borrowings in the commercial paper market  increasing our borrowings from this source by million  while decreasing borrowings under our amended credit agreement by million 
the increased level of funding from commercial paper reduced our total borrowing costs and contributed to lower usage of our revolving credit facility during in august  sears canada sold its headquarters office building and adjacent land in toronto  ontario for proceeds of million canadian  net of closing costs 
sears canada leased back the property under a leaseback agreement through march  at which time it finished its relocation of all head office operations to previously underutilized space in the toronto eaton centre  ontario 
the carrying value of the property was approximately million as of february  given the terms of the leaseback  for accounting purposes  the excess of proceeds received over the carrying value of the associated property was deferred  and the resulting million gain was recognized in fiscal when sears canada no longer occupied the associated property 
uses and sources of liquidity our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our retail businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes  including debt repayment  pension plan contributions and common share repurchases 
we believe that these needs will be adequately funded by our operating cash flows  credit terms received from vendors and borrowings under our amended credit agreement described below 
at january   billion was available under this facility 
the facility will decrease in size by billion to billion on march  while we expect to use the credit agreement as our primary funding source  we may also access the public debt markets on an opportunistic basis 
additionally  we may from time to time consider selective strategic transactions to create value and improve performance  which may include acquisitions  dispositions  restructurings  joint ventures and partnerships 
transactions of these types may result in material proceeds or cash outlays 
our year end fiscal and outstanding borrowings were as follows millions january  january  short term borrowings unsecured commercial paper secured borrowings long term debt  including current portion notes and debentures outstanding capitalized lease obligations total borrowings 
table of contents in fiscal  the finance committee of our board of directors authorized the repurchase  subject to market conditions and other factors  of up to million of our outstanding indebtedness in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the source of funds for the purchases is our cash from operations or borrowings under the credit agreement 
our wholly owned finance subsidiary  sears roebuck acceptance corp 
srac  has repurchased million of its outstanding notes  including million repurchased during fiscal  million repurchased during fiscal and million repurchased during fiscal  thereby reducing the unused balance of this authorization to million 
we recognized a gain of million on the repurchases made during fiscal certain of our debt is variable rate and we therefore manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding and interest rate derivatives 
at each of january   january  and february   we had interest rate derivatives with notional amounts of million and nominal fair values 
required debt repayments in the long term debt maturities occurring in the upcoming fiscal year are primarily for sears canada and orchard supply hardware osh borrowings as follows issue due in fiscal sears canada debentures and medium term notes osh collateralized mortgage backed loan principal payments on capital lease obligations other total long term debt maturities sears canada and osh are not wholly owned subsidiaries and therefore finance their operations separately from holdings 
accordingly  their debt is non recourse to holdings 
both sears canada and osh believe that they have adequate resources and access to capital markets to repay or refinance these maturities 
debt ratings the ratings of our domestic debt securities as of january  appear in the table below moody s investors service standard poor s ratings services fitch ratings unsecured long term debt ba bb bb unsecured commercial paper np b b credit agreement during the second quarter of  we extended the maturity date of our credit agreement original credit agreement by entering into an amended credit agreement the amended credit agreement which has an expiration date of june  the amended credit agreement is an asset based revolving credit facility under which srac and kmart corporation are the borrowers 
our original credit agreement  which was to expire on march   provided billion of borrowing capacity  however only approximately billion had been available since september when an affiliate of lehman brothers notified us it would no longer fund its proportionate share of commitments under the original agreement 
also during the second quarter of 
table of contents fiscal  we agreed  for a fee  to allow one of the lenders in our amended credit agreement to exit its commitment  which decreased our total borrowing capacity by million 
as a result of the amendment and changes to the facility during the second quarter  our total borrowing capacity increased to billion 
the fee we received related to the exit of one of our lenders was recorded as a reduction to interest expense during the second quarter of fiscal the amended credit agreement provides for a bifurcation of the billion credit facility into a billion tranche maturing on june   bearing an interest rate of the london interbank offered rate libor plus the extended tranche  with a libor floor of  and a billion tranche maturing march   bearing an initial interest rate of libor plus the existing tranche 
the bifurcation into the extended tranche provides holdings and its subsidiaries more than adequate liquidity for standby letters of credit and working capital needs 
the amended credit agreement also gives us the flexibility  subject to certain terms and conditions  to increase the size of the credit facility or add a term loan tranche to the amended credit agreement in an aggregate amount of up to billion 
it imposes various requirements  including a requirement that  if availability under the credit facility is beneath a certain threshold  the fixed charge ratio as of the last day of any fiscal quarter be not less than to  a cash dominion requirement if excess availability on the revolver falls below designated levels  and limitations on our ability to make restricted payments  including dividends and share repurchases 
in connection with the amended credit agreement  the company agreed to limit the amount of cash accumulated when borrowings are outstanding under the credit facility 
the amended credit agreement has a billion letter of credit sub limit  is secured by a first lien on most of our domestic inventory and credit card and pharmacy receivables  and determines availability pursuant to a borrowing base formula 
at january   we had million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the amended credit agreement 
our availability under the agreement  given total outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of million  was billion at january  the majority of the letters of credit outstanding are used to provide collateral for our insurance programs 
orchard supply hardware llc osh llc credit agreement in november  osh llc entered into a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility the osh llc facility  which includes a million letter of credit sublimit 
the osh llc facility was amended and extended in january and  as a result  available capacity was bifurcated into a million tranche maturing december and a million tranche maturing december the osh llc facility continues to have a million letter of credit sublimit 
the osh llc facility is available for osh llc s general corporate purposes and is secured by a first lien on substantially all of osh llc s non real estate assets 
availability under the osh llc facility is determined pursuant to a borrowing base formula based on inventory and account and credit card receivables  subject to certain limitations 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under the osh llc facility and million in outstanding letters of credit 
benefit and pension plan obligations contributions to our pension plans remain a significant use of our cash on an annual basis 
while sears holdings pension plan is frozen  and thus associates do not currently earn pension benefits  the company has a legacy pension obligation for past service performed by kmart and sears  roebuck and co 
associates 
during  we contributed million to our domestic pension plan 
however  our contributions are expected to increase in the future as a result of the severe decline in capital markets that occurred in based on guidance issued by the treasury department  we now estimate that the contribution will be approximately million in and million in  though the ultimate amount of pension contributions could be affected by further changes in the applicable regulation and financial market and investment performance 

table of contents wholly owned insurance subsidiary and inter company notes as noted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have numerous types of insurable risks  including workers compensation  product and general liability  automobile  warranty  and asbestos and environmental claims 
also  as discussed in note  we sell extended service contracts to our customers 
the associated risks are managed through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
in accordance with applicable insurance regulations  the insurance subsidiary holds investment grade securities to support the insurance coverage it provides 
we have transferred certain domestic real estate and intellectual property ie trademarks into separate wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries 
these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries lease the real estate property to sears and license the use of the trademarks to sears and kmart 
further  the bankruptcy remote subsidiaries have issued asset backed notes that are collateralized by the aforementioned real estate rental streams and intellectual property licensing fee streams 
cash flows received from rental streams and licensing fee streams paid by sears  kmart and  potentially in the future  other affiliates or third parties  will be used for the payment of fees  interest and principal on the asset backed notes issued 
since the inception of these subsidiaries  the debt securities have been entirely held by our wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries in support of our insurance activities 
at january  and january   the net book value of the securitized real estate assets was approximately billion 
the net book value of the securitized intellectual property assets was approximately billion at january  and january  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  is aggregated in the following tables

we currently have license agreements for which we pay royalties  including those to use jaclyn smith and joe boxer 
royalty license fees represent the minimum holdings is obligated to pay  regardless of sales  as guaranteed royalties under these license agreements 
as of january   our uncertain tax position liability and gross interest payable were million and million  respectively 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of liabilities and interest payments arising from uncertain tax positions in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions

we had the following guarantees outstanding as of january  millions bank issued srac issued other total standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit secondary lease obligations and performance guarantee the secondary lease obligations relate to certain store leases of previously divested sears businesses 
we remain secondarily liable if the primary obligor defaults 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  certain accounting policies require considerable judgment to select the appropriate assumptions to calculate financial estimates 
these estimates are complex and subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the selection of these estimates 
the following is a summary of our most critical policies and estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a listing of our other significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined primarily using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
to determine inventory cost under rim  inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics  which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the fiscal year purchasing activity for each store location 
accordingly  a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar 
table of contents turnover rates 
management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation 
rim inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation  as well as gross margin 
among others  two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and shrinkage 
amounts are charged to cost of sales  buying and occupancy at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  fashion trends and weather conditions 
in addition  inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre determined historical markdown cadences 
when a decision is made to permanently markdown merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
the timing of the decision  particularly surrounding the balance sheet date  can have a significant effect on the results of operations 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the date of the last physical inventory to the end of the fiscal year 
physical inventories are taken annually for all stores and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is used as the basis for the shrinkage accrual following the physical inventory 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  asbestos and environmental  automobile  warranty  product and general liability claims 
general liability costs relate primarily to litigation that arises from store operations 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed and carried at their expected ultimate settlement value and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our estimated claim amounts are discounted using a rate with a duration that approximates the duration of our self insurance reserve portfolio 
our liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheets represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors based on company specific data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
these projections are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
defined benefit retirement plans the fundamental components of accounting for defined benefit retirement plans consist of the compensation cost of the benefits earned  the interest cost from deferring payment of those benefits into the future and the results of investing any assets set aside to fund the obligation 
such retirement benefits were earned by associates ratably over their service careers 
therefore  the amounts reported in the income statement for these retirement plans have historically followed the same pattern 
accordingly  changes in the obligations or the value of assets to fund them have been recognized systematically and gradually over the associate s estimated period of service 
the largest drivers of losses in recent years have been the discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligation and the actual return on pension assets 
we recognize the changes by amortizing experience gains losses in excess of the corridor into expense over the associate service period and by recognizing the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five year period 
holdings actuarial valuations utilize key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset 
table of contents investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
income taxes we account for income taxes according to accounting standards for such taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  the company may record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
in accordance with accounting standards for uncertain tax positions  we record unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
further  we record the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  if any 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  tax planning and the company s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves in accordance with accounting standards for uncertain tax positions 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
management s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment  giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
for further information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments at january  and january   we had goodwill and intangible asset balances of billion and billion  respectively 
holdings evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment under accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets 
the majority of our goodwill and intangible assets relate to kmart s acquisition of sears  roebuck and co 
in march we allocated goodwill  which is defined as the total purchase price less the fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired  to reporting units as of the acquisition date 
as required by accounting standards  we perform annual goodwill and intangible impairment tests in the fourth quarter and update the tests between annual tests if events 
table of contents or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment assessments our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  using both a market participant approach  as well as a discounted cash flow model  commonly referred to as the income approach 
the market participant approach determines the value of a reporting unit by deriving market multiples for reporting units based on assumptions potential market participants would use in establishing a bid price for the unit 
this approach therefore assumes strategic initiatives will result in improvements in operational performance in the event of purchase  and includes the application of a discount rate based on market participant assumptions with respect to capital structure and access to capital markets 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
our final estimate of fair value of reporting units is developed by equally weighting the fair values determined through both the market participant and income approaches 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding goodwill and related impairment charges recorded during fiscal the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in either step of the goodwill impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units  the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  or the estimated fair value of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
at the fiscal annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion that no indication of goodwill impairment existed at the test date would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units  or a basis point decrease in the estimated sales growth rate or terminal period growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each reporting unit 

table of contents intangible asset impairment assessments we review definite and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we consider both the market approach and income approach when testing intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis 
we determined that the income approach  specifically the relief from royalty method  was most appropriate for analyzing our indefinite lived assets 
this method is based on the assumption that  in lieu of ownership  a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class 
the relief from royalty method involves two steps i estimation of reasonable royalty rates for the assets and ii the application of these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine a value 
we multiplied the selected royalty rate by the forecasted net sales stream to calculate the cost savings relief from royalty payment associated with the assets 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value by the selected discount rate and compared to the carrying value of the assets 
we did not record any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal or fiscal the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in our intangible asset impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of assets and the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of an asset  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
at the fiscal annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion that no indication of intangible asset impairment existed at the test date would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our assets to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units  a basis point decrease in the terminal period growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each reporting unit  or a basis point decrease in the royalty rate applied to the forecasted net sales stream of our assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face market risk exposure in the form of interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and equity price risk 
these market risks arise from our derivative financial instruments and debt obligations 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding and interest rate derivatives 
as of january   we had interest rate derivatives with a notional amount of million  nominal fair value and a weighted average remaining life of years 
all debt securities and interest rate derivative instruments are considered non trading 
as of january   of our debt portfolio was variable rate 
based on the size of this variable rate debt portfolio at january   which totaled approximately million  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would have affected annual pretax funding costs by million 
these estimates do not take into account the effect on income resulting from invested cash or the returns on assets being funded 
these estimates also assume that the variable rate funding portfolio remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
foreign currency risk as of january   we had a series of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding  totaling million canadian notional value and with a weighted average remaining life of years  designed to hedge our net investment in sears canada against adverse changes in exchange rates 
the aggregate fair value of the forward contracts as of january  was million 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the level of the canadian exchange rate relative to the us dollar as of january   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a loss in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts of approximately million as of january  certain of our currency forward contracts require collateral be posted in the event our liability under such contracts reaches a predetermined threshold 
cash collateral posted under these contracts is recorded as part of our accounts receivable balance 
we did not have any cash collateral posted under these contracts as of january  sears canada mitigates the risk of currency fluctuations on offshore merchandise purchases denominated in us currency by purchasing us dollar denominated option contracts for a portion of its expected requirements 
as of january   these contracts had a notional value of approximately million and a weighted average remaining life of years 
the aggregate fair value of the option contracts as of january  was million 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the level of the canadian exchange rate relative to the us dollar as of january   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a fair value for these contracts of approximately million as of january   a decrease of million 

table of contents counterparties we actively manage the risk of nonpayment by our derivative counterparties by limiting our exposure to individual counterparties based on credit ratings  value at risk and maturities 
the counterparties to these instruments are major financial institutions with credit ratings of single a or better 
in certain cases  counterparty risk is also managed through the use of collateral in the form of cash or us government securities
