revenue recognition 
chinacast s principal sources of revenues are from provision of satellite bandwidth and network access services in distance learning and to a lesser extent  the provision of english training services sales of satellite communication related equipment and accessories 
chinacast recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer  product is shipped and title has passed  the amount due from the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at the time of the transaction  chinacast assesses whether the amount due from the customer is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
chinacast assesses whether the amount due from the customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer  including  but not limited to  the payment terms associated with the transaction 
chinacast assesses collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
the revenues from provision of satellite bandwidth and network services in distance learning is recognized as the services are provided 
subscription fee received from the multimedia educational content broadcasting service is recognized as revenue over the subscription period during which the services are delivered 
the company established an english training service business line in the third quarter of the company provides two types of services to students 
students can attend english classes with unlimited access within a certain period of time generally from to months 
the other type of classes limits the number of times students can access within a certain period of time generally from to months 
tuition fees are non refundable for both types of tuition services 
revenues from the unlimited access classes are recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
revenues from the limited access classes are deferred and recognized on completion of the tuition period in the absence of available record supporting the number of times students attended classes during the tuition period 
revenues from bachelor degree and diploma program offerings  representing tuition fees and accommodation and catering service income  are recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
revenues from satellite communication related equipment and accessories are recognized once the equipment and accessories are delivered and accepted by the customers 
useful lives and impairment of property and equipment  and acquired intangible assets 
property and equipment and acquired intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
in particular  customer relationship ftbc acquired is amortized using the accelerated amortization method over months based on the estimated progression of the students through the respective courses  giving consideration to the revenue and cash flow associated 
customer relationship ljc acquired is amortized using the accelerated amortization method over months based on the estimated progression of the students through the respective courses  giving consideration to the revenue and cash flow associated 
affiliation agreement acquired is amortized on a straight line basis over months 
property and equipment and acquired intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
prepaid lease payments for land use rights 
all land in the prc is owned by the prc government 
the government in the prc  according to the relevant prc law  may grant the right to use the land for a specified period of time 
payments for acquiring land use rights represent prepayments of rentals over the periods the rights are granted and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and any recognized impairment loss 
amortization is provided over the term of the land use right agreement on a straight line basis 
prepaid lease payments which are to be amortized in the next twelve months or less are classified as current assets 
recoverability of non current receivable 
the company funded the operation of a related party  ccl  which held the satellite license before transferring it to the company 
the company assessed the recoverability of the non current receivables based on i the values of the satellite business to be transferred to the company  ii ccl s financial positions  and iii other matters including but not limited to change in business climate  relevant laws and regulations  etc 
share based compensation 
the company accounts for employee stock options under authoritative pronouncement issued by the fasb regarding share based payment from the inception of the company s stock compensation plans 
compensation cost related to employee share options or similar equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period  with a corresponding addition to paid in capital 
purchase price allocation in business combination 
for business acquisition recorded using the purchase method of accounting  acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair market value at the date of acquisition 
the company performs purchase price allocation based on such fair values 
the valuation analyses utilize and consider generally accepted valuation methodologies such as income  market and cost approach 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
impairment of cost method investments 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of the cost method investments for continued appropriateness 
this review is based upon the company s projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while the company believes that the estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuations 
deferred tax assets 
the company has provided a full valuation reserve related to its substantial deferred tax assets 
in the future  if sufficient evidence of the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  the company may be required to reduce its valuation allowances  resulting in income tax benefits in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized and assesses the need for valuation allowance 
tax contingency 
the tax contingency was previously assessed under authoritative pronouncement issued by fasb regarding accouting for contingencies 
effective on january   the company adopted the authoritative pronouncement regarding uncertainty in income taxes 
under the guidance  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely that not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority based solely on technical merits of the associated tax position 
the company also elected the accounting policy that the interest and penalties recognized are classified as part of its income taxes 
the unrecognized tax benefits  tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties represent management s estimates under the provisions of the guidance 
impairment of goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december  by operating segments was as follows rmb rmb e learning and training serve group elg traditional university group tug 
authoritative pronouncement issued by fasb regarding goodwill and others intangible assets  requires that the goodwill impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level 
the guidance requires a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step compares the fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test at december  our reporting units are consistent with our two operating segments 
the goodwill allocated to our elg segment arose in when we further purchased a portion of non controlling interests of one subsidiary  cct  from three non controlling shareholders 
we note that prior to this was the only reporting unit and segment of the company  and the market capitalization of the company as of december  rmb  million greatly exceeded the carrying amount of the elg reporting unit  rmb million 
accordingly  we determined that the first step of the goodwill impairment test was passed  and that the goodwill of the elg reporting unit was not impaired as of december  the assets and liabilities that make up the elg reporting unit did not change significantly from to the elg reporting unit is a relatively well established business 
revenue of this reporting unit has been growing steadily since revenue grew from to  and we expect that the revenue of this reporting unit will continue to grow in the future 
no significant negative events occurred and the likelihood that the fair value would be less than the carrying amount of the elg reporting unit as of december  was remote 
therefore we determined that the fair value of the elg reporting unit would be no less than the carrying amount of this reporting unit 
the company had one acquisition in which resulted in the addition of the tug segment 
the company had another acquisition in to further expand the tug segment 
for our tug segment  we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach 
the income approach involves applying appropriate discount rates to estimated cash flows that are based on earnings of forecasts developed by us 
the assumptions used in deriving the fair valuations are consistent with our business plan at the time of each valuation 
these assumptions include no material changes in the existing political  legal and economic conditions in china  no major changes in applicable tax rates and no material deviation in market conditions from our forecasts 
the risks associated with achieving our forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated cash flows 
in particular  the discounted cash flows for the tug reporting unit were based on discrete five year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the five year discrete forecast were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for the reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies 
the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the tug reporting unit are key assumptions description revenue growth rate the forecasted average annual growth rate of revenue is from to this reflects the following assumptions student capacity of the campus is expected to grow upon completion of the planned construction projects  demand for accredited degree program is expected to grow significantly in the prc  and a long term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined to be with reference to the birth rate  market penetration and other related factors 
cogs growth rate cost of goods sold cogs are forecasted to grow by to from to discount rate the discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc of the company 
wacc is the weighted average of the estimated rate of return required by equity and debt holders for an investment of this type 
we used 
publicly available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
during the years ended december   and  we determined that there had been no impairment of goodwill 
long term investments an affiliated company over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence  but does not have a controlling interest is accounted for using the equity method 
significant influence is generally considered to exist when the company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  and other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors  voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements  are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
the company s share of earnings of equity affiliate is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations below provision for income taxes 
for investments in an investee over which the company does not have significant influence and a controlling interest  the company carries the investment at cost and recognizes as income any dividend received from distribution of the investee s earnings 
the company reviews the investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may no longer be recoverable

accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncement in september  the fasb issued an authoritative pronouncement regarding the revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this pronouncement was issued in response to practice concerns related to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables under existing pronouncement 
although the new pronouncement retains the criteria from exiting pronouncement for when delivered items in a multiple deliverable arrangement should be considered separate units of accounting  it removes the previous separation criterion under existing pronouncement that objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items must exist for the delivered items to be considered a separate unit or separate units of accounting 
the new pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  entities can elect to apply this pronouncement prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements after the pronouncement s effective date or retrospectively for all periods presented 
early application is permitted  however  if the entity elects prospective application and early adopts this pronouncement after its first interim reporting period  it must also do the following in the period of adoption retrospectively apply this pronouncement as of the beginning of that fiscal year and disclose the effect of the retrospective adjustments on the prior interim periods revenue  income before taxes  net income  and earnings per share 
the group is in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of this pronouncement 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to clarify the scope of accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary 
the objective of this guidance is to address implementation issues related to changes in ownership provisions 
this guidance clarifies certain conditions  which need to apply to this guidance  and it also expands disclosure requirements for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary or derecognition of a group of assets 
this guidance is effective in the period in which an entity adopts the authoritative guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
if an entity has previously adopted the guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  the amendments in this update are effective beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  retrospective application to the first period that an entity adopted the guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements is required 
the group does not expect the adoption of this guidance would have a significant effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk our reporting currency is the renminbi 
transactions in other currencies are recorded in renminbi at the rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occur 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are remeasured into renminbi at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates 
exchange gains and losses are recorded in our statements of operations as a component of current period earnings 
the prc state administration for foreign exchange  under the authority of the people s bank of china  controls the conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies 
the principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in china is the foreign currency administration rules  as amended  or the rules 
under the rules  once various procedural requirements are met  renminbi is convertible for current account transactions  including trade and service related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments  but not for capital account transactions  including direct investment  loans or investments in securities outside china  without prior approval of the state administration of foreign exchange of the people s republic of china  or its local counterparts 
since july  the renminbi is no longer pegged to the us dollar 
although currently the renminbi exchange rate versus the us dollar is restricted to a rise or fall of no more than per day and the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  the prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 
as of december   the exchange rate of rmb to us was rmb we conduct substantially all of our operations through our prc operating companies  and their financial performance and position are measured in terms of renminbi 
our solutions are primarily procured  sold and delivered in the prc for renminbi 
the majority of our net revenue are denominated in renminbi 
any devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms of us dollars 
on the other hand  the appreciation of the renminbi could make our customers products more expensive to purchase because many of our customers are involved in the export of goods  which may have an adverse impact on their sales 
a decrease in sales by our customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  as of december  and  we have cash denominated in us dollars amounting to rmb million us million and rmb million  respectively 
also  from time to time we may have us dollar denominated borrowings 
accordingly  a decoupling of the renminbi many affect our financial performance in the future 
we recognized a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately rmb million us million for the year ended december  we do not currently engage in hedging activities  as such  we may in the future experience economic loss as a result of any foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk we have a long history of investing excess cash under a conservative corporate policy that only allows investments in bank fixed deposits  with preservation of capital and liquidity as the primary objectives 
for the year ended december   we recorded an interest income of rmb million us million 
any significant changes in interest rate might have an adverse effect on this interest income 
we have short term and long term bank loans amounting to rmb million us million as at december  interest expense in the twelve months end december  was rmb million us million 
any significant changes in interest rate might have an adverse effect on interest expense 
inflation in recent years  china has not experienced significant inflation  and thus inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in consumer price index in china was  and in  and respectively
