item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results  as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march   as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in the business section and the risk factors above  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute video game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms  including video game consoles such as the playstation  microsoft xbox and nintendo wii  personal computers  handheld game players such as the playstation portable psp and the nintendo ds and mobile devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone 
some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  fifa soccer  madden nfl football  harry potter  and hasbro s toy and game intellectual properties  and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property eg  the sims  need for speed  and dead space 
our goal is to publish titles with global mass market appeal  which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non english speaking countries 
in addition  we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property 
examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sports based products eg  fifa soccer  madden nfl football  and ncaa football  wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg  the sims  need for speed and battlefield and titles based on long lived literary and or movie properties eg  harry potter 
financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was  million  down million as compared to the fiscal year ended march  at march   deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content increased by million as compared to march   directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended march  at march   deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content decreased by million as compared to march   directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the year ended march  without these changes in deferred net revenue  reported net revenue increased by approximately million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenue for fiscal year was driven by fifa  madden nfl and the sims net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to a net loss of  million for the fiscal year ended march  diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to a diluted loss per share of for the fiscal year ended march  net loss decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of the recognition of million of goodwill impairment during the fiscal year ended march   a million decrease in our income tax provision primarily due to the discrete tax charge to establish the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in  a million decrease in cost of goods sold  and a million decrease in research and development costs 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease of million in net revenue and a million increase in restructuring charges primarily from our fiscal restructuring 
during fiscal year  we generated million of cash from operating activities as compared to generating million for fiscal year the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to decreases in personnel related costs and external development and contracted services as part of our cost reduction initiatives  as well as a reduction in incentive based compensation payments 

table of contents trends in our business economic environment 
overall consumer spending has declined as a result of the national and global economic downturn 
retailers globally continue to take a conservative stance in ordering game inventory 
we believe that the continued decline in the packaged goods sector contributed to the lower than anticipated demand for our products during the holiday selling season 
we remain cautious about our future sales in light of the economic environment and the impact it has had on our business 
current generation game consoles 
video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years  which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well 
the current cycle began with microsoft s launch of the xbox in  and continued in when sony and nintendo launched their next generation systems  the playstation and the wii  respectively 
unlike past cycles  we believe this current cycle may be extended  partly due to the growth of online gaming services and content  the greater graphic and processing power of the current generation hardware and the introduction of new peripherals 
however  growth in the installed base of users of the xbox  the playstation and the wii may slow down in light of the economic environment 
consequently  our industry may experience a decline 
wireless platforms 
advances in wireless technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for on the go interactive entertainment that appeal to a broad consumer base 
our efforts in wireless interactive entertainment are focused in two areas packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for mobile devices 
we expect sales of games for mobile devices to continue to be an important part of our business worldwide 
catalog sales 
the video game industry is experiencing a change in retail sales patterns which is decreasing revenue from our catalog sales 
currently  many console games experience sales cycles that are shorter than in the past 
to mitigate this trend  we offer our consumers a direct to consumer service such as head to head play or other multiplayer options and or additional content available through our online service to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase 
used games 
certain of our customers sell used video games  which are generally priced lower than new video games and do not result in revenue to the publisher of the games from the sale 
we have seen the market for used video games grow 
if our customers continue to increase their sales of used video games  it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse impact on our operating results 
concentration of sales among the most popular games 
we see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles  and that those titles are typically sequels of prior games 
we have reacted to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties 
digital content distribution and services 
consumers are spending an ever increasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online  or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones  or through social networks such as facebook and myspace 
we provide a variety of online delivered products and services 
many of our games that are available as packaged good products are also available through direct online download through the internet from websites we maintain and others that we license 
we also offer online delivered content and services that are add ons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services 
further  we provide other games  content and services that are available only via electronic delivery  such as internet only games and game services  and games for mobile devices 
advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving devices that are being used to play games by an ever broadening base of consumers 
we have responded to these advances in technology  and consumer acceptance of digital distribution  by offering subscription services  online downloads for a one time fee  and advertising supported free games and game sites 
we expect online delivery of games and game services to be an increasing part of our business going forward 

table of contents recent developments acquisition of playfish limited 
on november   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of playfish limited playfish for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash and equity 
in addition  we may be required to pay additional variable cash consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through december  this additional consideration is limited to a maximum of million 
playfish is a developer of free to play social games that can be played on social networking platforms 
fiscal restructuring plan 
in fiscal year  we announced details of a restructuring plan 
this plan includes a narrowing of our product portfolio to provide greater focus on titles with higher margin opportunities 
under this plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately  employees and have been consolidating or closing various facilities  eliminating certain titles  and incurring it and other costs to assist in reorganizing certain activities 
the majority of these actions were completed by march  since the inception of this plan through march   we have incurred charges of approximately million 
overall  including charges incurred through march   we expect to incur total cash and non cash charges between million and million by march  these charges consist primarily of employee related costs approximately million  intangible asset impairment costs  abandoned rights to intellectual property costs  and other costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions approximately million  facilities exit costs approximately million  and other reorganizational costs including it and consulting costs approximately million 
employee stock option exchange program 
on october   we launched a voluntary employee stock option exchange program exchange program to permit our eligible employees to exchange outstanding eligible options for a lesser number of restricted stock units  shares of restricted stock in canada only  or new options in china only to be granted under our equity incentive plan the equity plan 
the exchange program offer period began on october  and ended on november  options eligible for the exchange program were those options granted prior to october   that had an exercise price per share greater than  which was the week high trading price of our common stock measured as of the start date of the exchange program  as reported on the nasdaq global select market  and that upon conversion using the exchange ratio applicable for such options resulted in four or more shares of restricted stock units  shares of restricted stock or new options  as the case may be 
the exchange program resulted in options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock being exchanged for restricted stock units to acquire approximately  shares  approximately  shares of restricted stock awards and new options to purchase approximately  shares 
due to the structure of the exchange program as a value for value exchange for the eligible options tendered for exchange  and certain assumptions we are required to use regarding the eligible options for accounting purposes  we will recognize an incremental accounting charge of approximately million over the vesting period of the restricted stock units  restricted stock and options issued in the exchange program in addition to recognizing any remaining unrecognized expense for the stock options surrendered in the exchange 
international operations and foreign currency exchange impact 
international sales ie  revenue derived from countries other than canada and the united states  are a fundamental part of our business 
net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year and approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year we believe that in order to succeed internationally  it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs 
year over year  we estimate that foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue of approximately million  or percent  for the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the us dollar strengthened against other currencies  including the euro and the british pound sterling 
in addition  our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency 
if the us dollar continues to strengthen against these currencies  then foreign exchange rates may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition  sales returns  allowances and bad debt reserves we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and wii  pcs  handheld game players such as the psp and nintendo ds  and mobile devices such as cellular phones and smart phones including the apple iphone 
we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met evidence of an arrangement 
evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products that must be present in order to recognize revenue 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer 
for online game services  delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided 
for digital downloads that do not have an online service component  delivery is generally considered to occur when the download is made available 
fixed or determinable fee 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable generally upon cash collection 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must make assumptions and judgments in order to determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes to any of these assumptions or management judgments  or changes to the elements in a software arrangement  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
depending on the type of product  we may offer an online service that permits consumers to play against others via the internet and or receive additional updates or content from us 
for those games that consumers can play via the internet  we may provide a matchmaking service that permits consumers to connect with other consumers to play against each other online 
in those situations where we do not require an additional fee for this 
table of contents online service  we account for the sale of the software product and the online service as a bundled sale  or multiple element arrangement  in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price 
we defer net revenue from sales of these games for which we do not have vsoe for the online service that we provided in connection with the sale  and recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period  which is generally estimated to be six months beginning in the month after shipment 
in addition  for some software products we also provide updates or additional content digital content to be delivered via the internet that can be used with the original software product 
in many cases we separately sell digital content for an additional fee  however  some purchased digital content can only be accessed via the internet ie  the consumer never takes possession of the digital content 
we account for online transactions in which the consumer does not take possession of the digital content as a service transaction and  accordingly  we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated service period 
in other transactions  at the date we sell the software product we have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee 
in these cases  we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of game play 
determining whether a transaction constitutes an online service transaction or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult 
the accounting for these transactions is significantly different 
revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 
revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered 
if the service period is not defined  we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period 
determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 
in addition  determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult 
product revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors channel partners  is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns  price protection  and other offerings  which may occur with our customers and channel partners 
price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product 
the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price 
in certain countries  we have stock balancing programs for our pc and video game system software products  which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances 
it is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 
in certain countries  from time to time  we decide to provide price protection for our software products 
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products  current trends in retail and the video game segment  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products  and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing software products 
for example  the risk of product returns and or price protection for our software products may continue to increase as the playstation console moves through its lifecycle 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates changed  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported total net revenue 
in addition  if our estimates of returns and price protection related to online enabled packaged goods software products change  the amount of deferred net revenue we recognize in the future would change 

table of contents significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion on the appropriate accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount  and the cost approach  which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets and acquired in process technology  we use the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models  which require us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium 
making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective  and  if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired  liabilities and contingencies assumed  acquired in process technology  and contingent consideration issued in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets and acquired in process technology are amortized over various estimated useful lives 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill  an asset that is not amortized 
determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows 
determining the fair value of acquired in process technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset 
determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability 
determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled  and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participant s view of the risk associated with the obligation 
this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
assessment of impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets 
current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisition related intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired 
in order to determine if a potential 
table of contents impairment has occurred  management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows 
for some assets  our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful 
this success is dependent upon several factors  which are beyond our control  such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
we are required to perform a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we are required to perform the impairment test at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
to determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step  we use a combination of the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data  and or the income approach  which utilizes discounted cash flows 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of developing  marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of accuracy 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
assessment of impairment of short term investments  marketable equity securities and other investments 
we periodically review our short term investments  marketable equity securities and other investments for impairment 
our short term investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies  both are accounted for as available for sale securities 
unrealized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  net of tax  until either the security is sold or we determine that the fair value of the security has declined below its adjusted cost basis and the decline is other than temporary 
realized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income  net  and losses on strategic investments  net  respectively 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security 
the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the credit quality of the issuer  the duration that the fair value has been less than the adjusted cost basis  severity of the impairment  reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investees  and our intent to sell and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  any contractual terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process  as well as  if we would be required to sell an investment due to liquidity or contractual reasons before its anticipated recovery 
during the fiscal year ended march   and  we recognized impairment charges of million  million  and million  respectively  on our marketable equity securities 
our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future  which could have a material impact on our financial results 

table of contents our other investments consist principally of non voting preferred shares in two companies whose common stock is publicly traded and are accounted for under the cost method 
under this method  these investments are recorded at cost until we determine that the fair value of the investment has fallen below its adjusted cost basis and that such declines are other than temporary 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in the carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required  based primarily on the financial condition and near term prospects of the investees 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we recognized impairment charges of million  and million  respectively  on our other investments 
we did not recognize any impairment charges in fiscal year on our other investments 
assessment of inventory obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand 
we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value  based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess 
at the point of a loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
stock based compensation we are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
we recognize compensation costs for stock based payment transactions to employees based on their grant date fair value on a straight line approach over the service period for which such awards are expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase plan espp  respectively  is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award 
generally  our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes 
the key assumptions for the black scholes valuation calculation are risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use a combination of historical stock price volatility and implied volatility computed based on the price of options publicly traded on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
employee stock based compensation expense is calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment to stock based compensation expense will be recognized at that time 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate  as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact the compensation expense we recognize 
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to content licensors  independent software developers  and co publishing and distribution affiliates 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  
table of contents professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks  copyrights  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 
royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid 
these royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue 
significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract 
because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue  it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors  including the total number of titles subject to the contract  the timing of the release of these titles  the number of software units we expect to sell  which can be impacted by a number of variables  including product quality  the timing of the title s release and competition  and future pricing 
determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products 
accordingly  if our future revenue projections change  our effective royalty rates would change  which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and  therefore  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments  which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor 
when performance remains with the licensor  we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract 
these obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months 
as of march  and march   approximately million and million  respectively  of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 
each quarter  we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty based assets  as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments or losses determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold 
we evaluate long lived royalty based assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist 
unrecognized minimum royalty based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts and  therefore  any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 
during fiscal years  and  we recognized impairment charges of million  loss charges of million and loss and impairment charges of million  respectively 
the million impairment charge recognized during the fiscal year ended march   was primarily related to our fiscal restructuring 
this impairment is included in restructuring charges presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the loss charges in fiscal year primarily related to an amendment of a licensor agreement in which we terminated certain rights we previously had to use the licensor s intellectual property 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it 
table of contents is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in making this determination  we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified 
it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results  particularly in light of the recent deterioration of the economic environment 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income  we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets  namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments 
each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence  this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity 
certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 
for example  in determining the valuation allowance we recorded at june   we did not include as a source of future taxable income the taxable temporary difference related to the accumulated tax depreciation on our headquarters facilities in redwood city  california 
on july   we purchased our redwood shores headquarters facilities concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessor s financing agreements 
these facilities were subject to lease obligations to non affiliated parties which expired in july  and had been accounted for as operating leases 
the total amount paid under the terms of the leases was million  of which million related to the purchase price of the facilities and million was for the loss on our lease obligation 
therefore  in the fiscal quarter ended september   we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  consisting of approximately million related to the loss on our lease obligation and a million reduction in our valuation allowance due to the inclusion of a significant portion of the remaining taxable temporary difference as a source of future taxable income 
based on the assumptions and requirements noted above  we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets 
in addition  we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation  as well as with respect to other matters  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities 
the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations 
in addition  changes in our business  including acquisitions  changes in our international corporate structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix and amount of income  as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate

see non gaap financial measures below for an explanation of our use of this non gaap measure 
a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states is provided in the discussion below 
revenue deferral in this net revenue section  includes the unrecognized revenue from bundled sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and pc digital downloads for which either we do not have vsoe for the online service that we provide in connection with the sale of the software or we have an obligation to provide future incremental unspecified digital content  certain packaged goods sales of massively multiplayer online role playing games  and sales of certain incremental digital content associated with our games  which are types of micro transactions 
fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed  while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon the period of time the online features and services are to be provided and the timing of the sale 
for example  most revenue deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year  however  virtually all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year

table of contents non gaap financial measures net revenue before revenue deferral is a non gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral on net revenue related to packaged goods games and digital content 
we defer net revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for which we are not able to objectively determine the fair value as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for software sales of the online service that we provided in connection with the sale 
we recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated online service period 
we also defer net revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for which we had an obligation to deliver incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee 
we recognize the revenue for these games on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the game 
we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to packaged goods games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between years in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period 
we use this non gaap measure internally to evaluate our operating performance  when planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods  and when assessing the performance of our management team 
while we believe that this non gaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business  this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap

cost of goods sold for fiscal years and were as follows in millions march  of net revenue march  of net revenue change change as a of net revenue during fiscal year  cost of goods sold increased by percent as a percentage of total net revenue as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a million increase in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for the twelve months ended march   as compared to the twelve months ended march  overall  we estimate the increase in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content negatively impacted cost of goods sold as a percent of total net revenue by percentage points 
the overall increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was partially mitigated by a greater percentage of net revenue from ea studio products  which have a higher margin than our co publishing and distribution products  which positively impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue by approximately percent and ea studio products that we sold which had previously been written down to a lower costs basis and lower inventory write downs on our fiscal year releases as compared to our fiscal year releases  which positively impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue by approximately percent

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles for fiscal years and was as follows in millions march  of net revenue march  of net revenue change change amortization of intangibles decreased by million  or percent  in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a change in the estimated useful lives of certain intangibles 
this decrease is partially offset by the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of playfish 
acquired in process technology prior to the adoption of fasb asc  upon consummation of an acquisition  we generally incurred a charge for the related acquired in process technology  as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
the development of a majority of the projects for which we incurred an acquired in process technology charge in connection with our acquisition of vgh were either completed or did not reach technological feasibility and therefore were abandoned 
as of march   we had one project in connection with our acquisition of vgh that continued to be in process 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
certain abandoned acquisition related costs certain abandoned acquisition related costs consist of costs we incurred in connection with the abandoned acquisition of take two 
on august   we allowed our tender offer for take two shares to expire and on september   we announced that we had terminated discussions with take two 
as a result  during the fiscal year ended march   we recognized million in related costs consisting of legal  banking and other consulting fees 
goodwill impairment adverse economic conditions  including the decline in our market capitalization and our expected financial performance at the time  indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed during the fiscal year ended march  as a result  we performed goodwill impairment tests for our reporting units

income taxes income tax provision benefit for fiscal years and were as follows in millions march  effective tax rate march  effective tax rate change our effective income tax rate was a tax benefit of percent for fiscal year our effective income tax rate was percent for fiscal year in fiscal year  our effective tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate of percent due primarily to us losses for which no benefit is recognized  tax charges related to our integration of playfish  non us losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and non deductible stock based compensation expenses  partially offset by benefits related to the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities and reductions in the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets 
in fiscal year  we recorded a tax provision instead of a tax benefit on the pre tax loss due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate in fiscal differed from the us statutory tax rate of percent due primarily to the deferred tax valuation allowance  non deductible goodwill impairment  non deductible stock based compensation expenses  non deductible losses on strategic investments  losses in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us rate of percent  and a loss on facility impairment for which the future tax benefit is uncertain and not more likely than not to be realized 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal year and future periods will depend on a variety of factors  including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions  changes in our international structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of income  changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in our annual pre tax income or loss 
we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax provision will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income or loss  our effective tax rate will be more volatile 
certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit 
table of contents of deferred tax assets 
for example  in determining the valuation allowance we recorded at june   we did not include as a source of future taxable income the taxable temporary difference related to the accumulated tax depreciation on our headquarters facilities in redwood city  california 
on july   we purchased our redwood shores headquarters facilities concurrent with the expiration and extinguishment of the lessor s financing agreements 
these facilities were subject to lease obligations to non affiliated parties which expired in july  and had been accounted for as operating leases 
the total amount paid under the terms of the leases was million  of which million related to the purchase price of the facilities and million was for the loss on our lease obligation 
therefore  in the fiscal quarter ended september   we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  consisting of approximately million related to the loss on our lease obligation and a million reduction in our valuation allowance due to the inclusion of a significant portion of the remaining taxable temporary difference as a source of future taxable income 
the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of the act was signed into law on november  the act provides that taxpayers may elect to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in a taxable year beginning or ending in either or during the fiscal quarter ended december   we elected to increase the carry back period for tax losses incurred in fiscal year this election resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets due to an increase in the sources of taxable income from the extended carry back period 
as a result  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million in the fiscal quarter ended december  for the reduction in the valuation allowance

financial condition we believe that cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable equity securities  cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and  potentially  future acquisitions or strategic investments

we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and third party developers during development of our games  usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones 
contractually  these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products 
these terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and third party developers 
in addition  we have certain celebrity  league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and market prices  which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices 
we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks 
foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below 
while we do not hedge our short term investment portfolio  we protect our short term investment portfolio against different market risks  including interest rate risk as discussed below 
our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk cash flow hedging activities 
from time to time  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedge is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses  as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective  the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value  if any  is reclassified to interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur  or it becomes remote that they will occur  within the defined hedge period  the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income  net  on our consolidated statements of operations 
our hedging programs are designed to reduce  but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currency and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
all of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march  will mature in the next months 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currency and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
as of march  and  these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of million in each year and are included in other current assets 
balance sheet hedging activities 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near month end 
our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments  and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  which are also reported in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
in certain cases  the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary asset or liability  in which case our results will be impacted 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign 
table of contents currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pounds sterling 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of march  and march  we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and foreign currency option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material  the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business 
a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure credit worthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of million in both scenarios 
a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of million and million  respectively  as of march  this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
however  because short term investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of short term investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments 
additionally  the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call  prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value 
our investments are held for purposes other than trading 
also  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
as of march  and  our short term investments were classified as available for sale securities and  consequently  were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of any tax effects  in stockholders equity 
our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories  summarized by fair value as of march  and in millions as of march  corporate bonds us agency securities us treasury securities commercial paper asset backed securities total short term investments 
table of contents notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio
