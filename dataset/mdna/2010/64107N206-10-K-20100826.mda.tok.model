item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report contains detailed financial information about these operating segments for fiscal  and all references to net  the company  we  us  or our are references to net ueps technologies  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries  collectively  except as otherwise indicated or where the context indicates otherwise 
market opportunity services for the under banked according to the united states census bureau  the world s population currently exceeds billion people 
yet of this total  it has been reported that over four billion people earn less than the purchasing parity equivalent of two dollars per day 
in general  these people either have no bank account or very limited access to formal financial services 
this situation arises when either banking fees are too high relative to an individual s income  a bank account provides little or no meaningful benefit or there is insufficient infrastructure to provide financial services economically in the individual s geographic location 
we refer to these people as the unbanked and the under banked 
these individuals typically receive wages  welfare benefits  money transfers or loans in the form of cash  and conduct commercial transactions  including the purchase of food and clothing  in cash 
the use of cash  however  does present significant risks 
in the case of recipients  they generally have no secure way of protecting their cash other than by converting it immediately into goods  carrying it with them or hiding it 
in cases where an individual has access to a bank account  the typical deposit  withdrawal and account fees meaningfully reduce the money available to meet basic needs 
for government agencies and employers  using cash to pay welfare benefits or wages results in significant expense due to the logistics of obtaining that cash  moving it to distribution points and protecting it from theft 
with over million cardholders in more than developing countries around the world  our track record and scale uniquely positions us to continue further geographical penetration of our technology in additional emerging countries 
online transaction processing services the rapid global growth of retail credit and debit card transactions is reflected in the may nilson report  according to which worldwide annual general purpose card purchase volume increased to trillion in general purpose cards include the major card network brands such as mastercard  visa and american express 
we operate the largest bank independent transaction processing service in south africa through easypay  where we have developed a suite of value added services such as bill payment  airtime top up  gift card  money transfer and pre paid utility purchases that we offer as a complete solution to merchants and retailers 
our expertise in on line transaction processing and value added services provides us with the opportunity to participate globally in this rapidly growing market segment 
mobile payments in february  the united nations international telecommunications union estimated that there are now approximately billion mobile phone subscribers deployed globally  and we believe that this includes subscribers in the majority of our targeted emerging economies 
despite lacking access to formal financial services  large proportions of the under banked customer segment own and utilize mobile phones 
as a result  mobile phones are increasingly being viewed as a channel through which this underserved population can gain access to formal financial and other services 
today  most mobile payment solutions offered by various participants in the industry largely provide access to information and basic services  such as allowing consumers to check account balances or transfer funds between existing accounts with the financial institution  but they offer limited functionality and ability to use the mobile device as an actual payments and banking instrument 
our proprietary mobile virtual card technology  when used on a mobile device  is ideally suited to significantly reducing fraud in card not present transactions typically performed in developed countries such as the united states and western europe and is also a comprehensive banking and payment solution for the under banked population in developing economies 
healthcare given lack of broad based healthcare services in many emerging countries  governments are increasingly focused on driving initiatives to provide affordable and accessible healthcare services to their populations 
similarly  countries such as the united states are embarking on expansive overhauls of their existing healthcare systems 
by combining net s payment expertise with medikredit s real time claims processing technology  we are able to offer governments  funders and providers of healthcare with a comprehensive solution that offers a completely automated system  reducing both cost and time 
our off line transacting solution we believe that we are the first company to enable the affordable delivery of financial products and services to the world s unbanked and under banked people 
our approach takes full advantage of moving processing away from a centralized point to the computer chip embedded on a smart card 
a smart card reader  a point of service or pos device  is used to enable communication between smart cards in real time during a transaction and indirectly with our mainframe computer at a later time 
this architecture has significant implications in terms of the products and services that we can deliver compared to those offered by banking institutions or other card providers 
first  our system enables offline transactions  which is essential in serving the unbanked and under banked 
second  while offline  the smart card can engage in sophisticated transaction processing  using data encryption and biometric fingerprint protection to ensure security 
in fact  our smart cards can calculate the interest owed to the card holder for having funds recorded onto our system without ever coming online 
third  with all of the software and transaction records on the smart card  the pos device itself requires far fewer components  circuitry and memory  substantially reducing costs 
fourth  each transaction is recorded on both participating smart cards  copied in subsequent transactions to additional smart cards  and ultimately reported to our mainframe computer 
this creates a full audit trail that significantly reduces the potential for corruption  theft and fraud 
lastly  instead of having to build the overall system to handle peak loads  our system further reduces costs by smoothing the transaction flow over time 
we believe that our solution delivers benefits to each of the users of our system  including individuals 
there is no minimum income requirement for individuals to use our smart card  making our solution universally accessible 
it is also inexpensive since the overall cost of the system is much less than widely available solutions  including cash  bank accounts and bank cards that require online access 
our solution additionally has the advantage of working everywhere  including remote areas where many unbanked and under banked people live 
equally important  our solution is secure and smart cards are replaceable 
this means that individuals do not have to fear that their money will be stolen or that they will be charged for fraudulent transactions as all transactions are verified biometrically through fingerprints 
since the smart card performs all of the required computing processing and contains all of the different service features  the smart card can be tailored to meet the needs of the individual 
card holders can also receive interest on their card balances  a benefit not available to them when transacting solely in cash 
we believe our solution has the potential to enhance significantly the living standards of the unbanked and under banked by reducing transaction costs and providing them with new and additional financial products and services  which are otherwise largely procured from the informal sector 
merchants and financial service providers 
merchants derive multiple benefits from our system 
our system decreases the amount of cash they must hold  improving security and reducing expenses  such as cash deposit fees and cash losses 
by providing financial services through our pos devices  merchants also benefit from new income streams at no additional incremental cost 
in addition  our system provides a record of transactions that is useful for administrative purposes 
for formal financial service providers  the use of smart cards provides opportunities to directly sell products and services to a market that was previously difficult to reach 
for instance  insurance companies can offer their products with the premium deducted directly from the individual s smart card 
in the case of lending  administrative costs are decreased along with the expense of holding cash 
again  the collection of payments can occur directly from the smart card  reducing credit risk and helping to establish credit history 
employers 
our system enables employers to eliminate cash from the wage payment process 
this reduces expenses by avoiding cash handling and management  the need to insure  secure and transport that cash and the bank transaction fees associated with obtaining cash in the first place 
the process of paying employees using cash is also time consuming  taking up to half a day per pay period in some instances 
the use of our system eliminates this process and thereby increases productivity 
in addition  because cash payments are distributed in packets to employees  disputes can arise as to the amount of cash in the packet 
our system also addresses this issue as the amount reflected on the card holders accounts are recorded on the back end system and then distributed on the smart cards 
finally  employers frequently provide additional services to their employees out of necessity  particularly loans 
our system enables other service providers to deliver these products 
government agencies 
a fundamental policy goal for almost any government is to enhance the welfare of the poorest citizens in the country 
yet the use of cash is a poor method for delivering social welfare grants since it is difficult to track  and the recipients endure a range of expenses and dangers that reduce their options 
by using our system  government agencies enjoy reduced costs in the delivery of benefits to recipients by eliminating the use of cash while increasing the options available to the recipient 
this use of our system intrinsically increases the welfare that government agencies can provide from the same amount of taxes collected 
our system also has the potential to increase the amount of taxes collected by bringing informal businesses into the formal economy 
the presence of a full audit trail also means that government agencies can combat corruption 
moreover  the use of smart cards for the delivery of additional services  including insurance products  means that regulatory bodies can expand their oversight of transactions for individuals who are frequently least able to protect themselves 
in regard to medical benefits  our system provides comprehensive inventory management and has the potential to improve the treatment of patients significantly 
the ueps technology we developed our core ueps and duet technology to enable the affordable delivery of financial products and services to the world s unbanked and under banked populations 
our proprietary technology is designed to provide the secure delivery of these products and services in the most under developed or rural environments  even in those that have little or no communications infrastructure 
unlike a traditional credit or debit card where the operation of the account occurs on a centralized computer  each of our smart cards effectively operates as an individual bank account for all types of transactions 
all transactions that take place through our system occur between two smart cards at the pos as all of the relevant information necessary to perform and record transactions reside on the smart cards 
the transfer of money or other information can take place without any communication with a centralized computer since all validation  creation of audit records  encryption  decryption and authorization take place on  or are generated between  the smart cards themselves 
importantly  the cards are protected through the use of biometric fingerprint identification  which is designed to ensure the security of funds and card holder information 
transactions are generally settled by merchants and other commercial participants in the system by sending transaction data to a mainframe computer on a batch basis 
settlements can be performed online or offline 
the mainframe computer provides a central database of transactions  creating a complete audit trail that enables us to replace lost smart cards while preserving the notional account balance  and to identify fraud 
system components our platform consists of three fundamental components our funds transfer system  or fts  intellectual property our ueps duet software and our security protocol 
fts 
our fts intellectual property allows funds to be transferred from one smart card to another in a secure and offline manner 
the term offline refers to transactions that are effected without the need to contact or communicate with the issuer when the transactions occur  as the smart cards themselves perform the authorizations required 
the fts also describes how smart cards can be loaded or re loaded with funds and how these can be redeemed for value in either banking or non banking environments 
ueps duet 
our ueps is a suite of software programs that make use of the fts methodology to deliver an integrated information  payment  switching and settlement environment that underpins our transaction processing system 
our software principally runs on three devices the smart card  the pos device and the back end system mainframe 
when we sell a complete system to a customer or license our technology  we provide all of the software required to operate the ueps  including the smart card functionality  the pos devices that allow our smart cards to transact with each other in an offline manner and our back end system that primarily stores an audit trail of all transactions effected 
the primary strengths of the ueps are its affordability  security and flexibility 
the system is affordable because the computer chips on the smart cards contain all the software necessary to process ueps transactions  thereby allowing the pos devices required to conduct these transactions to contain far fewer components and less circuitry than traditional pos devices 
there is also a reduced need for processing power and on board memory given that online communication is not necessary 
this eliminates the need for an internal or external modem and its associated hardware  maintenance and call costs 
as a result  the ueps terminals are relatively inexpensive and do not require specialized technical expertise for installation 
the ueps also reduces or eliminates the need for national infrastructures  including electricity  telephone or data transmission 
the ueps is secure because the funds in each smart card are protected from illegal access through biometric fingerprint technology 
in addition  every transaction is verified by the two smart cards involved in the transaction using state of the art cryptographic systems in conjunction with protocols and techniques that we have developed 
finally  our ueps is flexible because transactions are completed offline  eliminating virtually all restrictions where verified transactions can occur 
security protocol 
our security protocol was designed to prevent opportunistic fraud and enforce the correct transaction flow 
the symmetric triple data encryption standard  or des  is used extensively in association with a native random number generator that ensures that all transactions are performed by using a random session key pair 
the des encryption algorithm can be easily modified to use alternative symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms such as the rivest  shamir and adleman or elliptic curves 
each message exchanged during a transaction names both transacting parties  includes unique information to guarantee freshness and depends explicitly on all the messages that occur before it 
our payment system platform the following diagram depicts how our ueps platform is constructed 
ueps duet platform fully functional and integrated payment and settlement system  capable of operating all ueps and duet products and systems 

imagejpg 
complete systems combination of products meeting a client s particular requirements 
stand alone products financial transaction applications ss products 
functionality combination of hardware and operating systems on smart cards enable the creation of ueps applications which can be customized for the particular needs of a client 
operating systems third party software 
ueps duet software programmed by us 
smart cards sim cards hardware cards sourced from third party vendors 
hardware pos devices  atms  mobile phones  back end computer systems sourced from third party vendors 
the ueps we sell to clients is a platform with the potential to provide all of the products we develop which  when grouped together  form complete systems serving the specific needs of various business segments 
depending on the requirements of a particular customer  we assist the customer in the setup of its application which is tailored to provide only the products and services initially required  although the ueps can later be updated to provide additional products 
we outsource the manufacturing of the hardware components of our system  including smart cards  pos devices  automated teller machines  or atms  pcs and back end mainframes 
however  we have developed all of our application software modules so that they will run on different hardware platforms which allow us to be hardware independent and to provide our customers with the latest and most economical hardware solutions 
scalability 
our ueps can be implemented in different environments  from small closed systems to national implementations 
in closed system environments  the ueps front end equipment is personal computer based and can therefore be implemented at relatively low cost 
in these instances  we provide the back end system on a transaction fee basis  thus limiting the overall set up cost 
this approach can also be used whenever larger implementations are required but where the customer prefers to focus on marketing and selling its products rather than initially concentrating on operating the back end system 
the cost to entry can thus be greatly reduced as the operations can first become profitable before expending large amounts of capital 
on the other hand  large governmental institutions  financial institutions or medical insurers typically prefer to maintain control over the entire payment system and therefore invest in a full system implementation 
the time to launch these projects tends to be longer due to the time that is required to train the end user to operate the system 
once a ueps is installed on behalf of a customer  we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the scalability of the system as minimal changes are required to be made to the application base for the system to manage significantly greater numbers of users 
we can therefore provide additional smart cards while leveraging the existing cost base in a market 
in addition  we have a dedicated team of technicians and developers and an infrastructure capable of supporting a significant volume of customers and their transactions 
as a result  we expect to benefit from economies of scale that pertain to increases in the number of products and services using the infrastructures we sell and or implement 
our business strengths we believe our business strengths include technology leadership 
we believe that we are the leader in developing  implementing and operating affordable  flexible and secure electronic payment systems for the unbanked and under banked that work offline 
of equal importance  our smart cards are secured through biometric fingerprint authentication and have a broad range of additional functionality through the use of wallets that can be turned on as needed or as services become available 
we can deliver these services to the unbanked population at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems 
our ability to implement an hiv aids administrative system on the same smart card as financial services demonstrates the flexibility of our approach 
in addition  we have validated the security of our smart cards along with our overall system  forming the foundation for a trusted solution 
independent third parties have reviewed and published our security protocols and we have refined our system in a way to provide system integrity over the life of the smart cards 
from our inception in to date  we have not suffered any security breaches or losses of transactions or funds on our system 
in addition  we have well established core cryptography  software  hardware  embedded chip  wireless and payment expertise 
proven solution 
our system is proven and is widely used by over million of cardholders in more than countries 
versatile application 
once an individual begins using our smart card  we become a logical provider of a broad range of additional products and services 
for instance  a card holder using our system for the administration of medical treatment can also use the same smart card for receiving welfare payments or wages as well as making purchases 
because use of each smart card is secured biometrically  the smart card can also be used for identification and voting 
the additional uses mean that once we have enrolled and delivered a smart card to an individual  our revenue potential increases significantly beyond the initial service for which that individual has signed up 
broad appeal that drives opportunities 
because our system provides economic benefits to all participants  we believe there are strong incentives for government agencies and private sector companies to adopt our system in many developing countries 
our solution is also appealing because a single deployment enables the delivery of a broad array of new services to those who are potentially most in need of them  often at a lower cost than alternative distribution methods 
increasing returns to scale 
the initial establishment of our system in a province or country requires upfront expenditures for computers  distribution infrastructure and card holder registration 
once in place  though  the cost to us of supplying additional products to users is low 
for instance  if a customer receives welfare payments on one of our smart cards and then chooses to purchase insurance through our system  there is almost no additional expense for us to deduct the insurance premium regularly 
as a result  the operating margin for that customer increases significantly  offset only by any marketing or administrative costs associated with that product 
our strategy we intend to provide the leading transacting system for the world s estimated four billion unbanked and under banked people to engage in electronic transactions  as well as to provide our transaction processing  value added services processing  new secure mobile payment technologies and health care processing services globally 
to achieve these goals  we are pursuing the following strategies using our first wave second wave approach to expand into new markets we use what we refer to as a first wave second wave approach to market expansion 
in the first wave  we seek to identify an application for which there is a demonstrated and immediate need in a particular territory and then sell and implement our technology to fulfill this initial need 
as a result  we achieve the deployment of the required technological infrastructure as well as the registration of a critical mass of cardholders 
during this phase  we generate revenues from the sale of our software and hardware devices  as well as ongoing revenues from transaction fees  maintenance services and the use of our biometric verification engine 
once the infrastructure has been deployed and we achieve a critical mass of customers  we focus on the second wave  which allows us to use this infrastructure to provide users  at a low incremental cost to us  with a wide array of financial products and services for which we can charge fees based on the value of the transactions performed 
realigning management responsibilities and internal systems on a geographic basis to maximize our ability to target more markets simultaneously the new ueps systems that we have launched outside south africa have received a high level of attention from governments and central banks  among others  and we are continually being presented with opportunities to discuss the implementation of new systems in countries around the world 
in addition  as a result of our august acquisition of net universal technologies austria ag  or net uta  we now provide smart card based payment systems in russia and other members of the commonwealth of independent states  or cis  as well as several other countries 
we believe that we can accelerate our expansion into new markets while making the most efficient use of our senior management  marketing and information technology personnel by creating separate clusters and within those clusters  business units  each of which is devoted to a particular geographic area and or specific technologies  products and services  and we have recently completed the process of defining and creating those groups 
leveraging our new payment technologies to gain access to developed economies while our business has traditionally focused on marketing products and services to the world s unbanked and under banked population  we have developed and acquired proprietary technology  such as our virtual card application for mobile telephones that is designed to eliminate fraud associated with card not present credit card transactions  which are those effected by telephone or over the internet 
we plan to introduce this technology in the united states  western europe and other developed economies 
our business in south africa in south africa  we are one of the leading independent transaction processors  as the leading provider of social welfare payment distribution services to the country s large unbanked and under banked population  the largest third party processor of retail merchant transactions and the leading processor of third party payroll payments 
we believe that our large cardholder base  proprietary technology and payment infrastructure  together with our strong government and business relationships  position us at the epicenter of commerce in the country 
we believe that we are well positioned to continue to gain market share and build upon the critical mass that we have developed in south africa and have identified the following opportunities to continue to drive growth in our south african business government focus on expansion of social benefits as a result of the south african government s focus on the provision of social grants as a core element of its social assistance and poverty alleviation policies  we believe that we remain well positioned to continue to provide our payment services to the government and beneficiaries 
we believe that there is a compelling argument for the south african social security agency  or sassa  and other government agencies to utilize our innovative  off line  secure  efficient and low cost payment solution to reach beneficiaries across the country  even in the most remote and deep rural areas where the communication and electricity infrastructure is sparse or non existent 
on august   we signed a new service level agreement with sassa that expires on march  we discuss this new agreement in more detail elsewhere in this annual report  including under item b 
other information 
increasing adoption of existing services our technology supports a variety of other products and smart card to smart card  or ss  services that expand the use of our technology and provide us with new sources of transaction based revenues 
during the last several years  we have introduced these new products and services in south africa for existing and newly enrolled cardholders 
we have installed our pos terminals in thousands of mostly rural merchant locations throughout the country which allows beneficiaries to receive their grants at these locations and transact business with the retailers using our smart card 
during fiscal  we processed million transactions with a total value of zar billion at these merchant locations 
in addition  during fiscal  we began implementing our wage payment solution which provides for secure payroll distribution through our smart card 
introduction of new services we are also poised to benefit from the introduction and adoption of new services across our various platforms  which we believe will generate significant incremental transaction fee revenue from current and new users at a relatively low cost to us 
some of these services include acceptance of ueps cards in traditional pos terminals we are currently enabling our cards to be compliant with international emv standards  which will allow our cardholder base to purchase goods and services at merchant pos locations that currently accept mastercard branded cards 
this additional functionality will allow us to expand significantly the number of terminals that use our smart card  capturing fees from new transactions and positioning our cards to be used by a larger share of the banked population 
merchant processing through easypay easypay is the largest independent financial switch and merchant processor in south africa for credit and debit card transactions 
easypay processed million transactions with a total value of zar billion during fiscal our technology also allows us to provide a variety of additional  value added payment services  such as bill payment  prepaid mobile top up  prepaid utility services and gift cards  that we can sell into our existing card holder base as well as to new customers 
we have integrated our propriety ueps software with these services to create a larger  seamless  value added payments eco system 
third party payments from payroll processing through fihrst through our fihrst service  we offer employers an easy and flexible method of making payments to employees and payroll related creditors 
during the three months ended june   fihrst processed million transactions with a total value of zar billion 
the fihrst system enables human resources departments to achieve greater levels of efficiency and employee service 
fihrst is recognized by and works in partnership with the majority of third party payroll organizations  including pension fund and medical aid administrators 
on line real time management of healthcare transactions processing through medikredit through our medikredit service we provide both funders and providers of healthcare on line real time management of healthcare transactions 
during the six months ended june   medikredit processed million transactions 
our dynamic healthcare claims processing and managed care services are designed to accommodate our clients unique benefit designs and processing needs 
the african continent and iraq during the last five years  we have embarked on an international expansion program to provide a ueps based solution in developing economies outside south africa where we see significant growth opportunities  typically in those countries that have a significant unbanked or under banked population 
consistent with our first wave second wave approach  in each market  we seek to identify one or more specific applications for our technology and then determine how best to create a card holder base to whom we can then provide  at a low incremental cost to us  additional products and services for which we can charge transaction fees 
we are currently targeting services such as payment schemes for welfare distribution  healthcare services  banking services  transportation services  bill payments  mobile communication services  payroll  remittances and e commerce 
we are in varying stages of implementing this expansion and employ a variety of business models  depending on the market  including providing outsourced transaction processing services  licensing our ueps system or creating joint ventures with local partners and service providers 
some examples of our current and future expansion activities across the african continent include ghana we were awarded a contract by the central bank of ghana to create the ghanaian national switch and smart card payment system  which was officially launched in april all ghanaian banks are required to participate in the system and issue our smart cards to their customers 
the system creates interoperability between atms  pos and teller terminals owned by the individual banks 
iraq we have implemented a customized ueps banking and payment system that enables offline and online retail payment transactions in iraq 
this system provides interoperability between atms  pos devices and bank branches and facilitates the distribution of cash disbursements in iraq including the payment of social grants to war victims  employee salary wage payments  banking products and other financial services 
joint ventures in botswana  namibia and nigeria we own of smartswitch botswana and smartswitch namibia  which license our ueps software and buy cards and terminals from us 
these entities contract to provide our technology to various users  such as to the botswana department of social services  which distributes government grants and nampost  a namibian governmental entity which provides post office and banking services 
in nigeria  smartswitch nigeria  of which we own  has provided  smart cards to one of nigeria s largest banking institutions for its initial deployment into village community banks 
expected applications for the ueps technology in nigeria include banking  health care  money transfers  pre paid utilities and telephony and voting 
other african countries we are currently exploring opportunities with governments  as well as banks and merchants in other african countries  to establish alternate payment systems in these countries using our ueps technology 
russia and other cis members through our majority owned subsidiary  net uta  which we acquired in august  we provide smart card based payment systems under the duet name to banks  enterprises and government authorities in russia  ukraine  uzbekistan  mongolia  vietnam  india and oman 
the duet system was developed by net uta as a derivative of the first version of our ueps technology that we licensed to net uta in net uta provides the duet system to sberbank  the largest financial institution in russia  which owns the remaining minority interest in net uta 
one of our primary reasons for acquiring net uta was to obtain immediate access to the large sberbank cardholder base 
while net uta s business model has historically been based primarily on the sale of cards and hardware  we intend to transition the business into more of a transaction processing services provider over time by leveraging net uta s management  sales force and customer base to sell the ueps platform and its suite of processing services 
emerging growth opportunities we believe that an area for significant potential growth is the opportunity to introduce some of our new technologies  such as our medikredit  net virtual card and mobile payment applications  in the more developed economies of the united states and western europe and to leverage the flexibility and multi application capabilities of our ueps technology to capture extensive  country specific applications in less developed countries 
new technologies our net virtual card application is designed to reduce the higher levels of fraud associated with card not present credit card transactions without the need for additional infrastructure or any changes to existing infrastructures 
this application creates a one time use digital card generated on demand off line from a mobile phone 
as opposed to a physical credit card  our virtual card is only valid for a specific value and cannot be used more than once 
it contains no personal user information such as a bank account or telephone number 
we believe that strong growth trends in e commerce and the rapidly increasing adoption of mobile commerce  such as downloaded ring tones  mobile applications and mobile payment services  will present significant opportunities for our net virtual card technology 
mobile payment applications in latin america and asia we have entered the latin american market by offering our vtu system and services through vtu colombia  of which we own 
the joint venture provides virtual prepaid mobile top up services for two of colombia s three largest mobile operators 
we plan to expand this service into new areas of colombia and other markets in latin america 
in addition  through our equity stake in vinapay  we are providing our vtu system and services in vietnam 
country specific applications we are also pursuing discrete opportunities to create unique country specific applications  such as a national identification card with multiple applications like a contactless transport card 
our business units and technologies our group is organized into the following clusters and within each cluster  separate business units 
transactional solutions cluster cash paymaster services cps our cps business unit deploys our ueps social grant distribution technology to distribute social welfare grants on a monthly basis to roughly million beneficiaries in five provinces out of the nine south african provinces 
these social welfare grants are distributed on behalf of sassa 
during our  and fiscal years  we derived  and of our revenues respectively  from cps social welfare grant distribution business 
as discussed above  on august   we signed a new service level agreement with sassa 
cps provides a secure and affordable transacting channel between social welfare grant beneficiaries  sassa and formal businesses 
cps enrolls social welfare grant beneficiaries by issuing them a ueps smart card that digitally stores their biometric fingerprint templates on the smart card  enabling them to access their social welfare grants securely at any time or place 
the smart card is issued to the beneficiary on site and utilizes optical fingerprint sensor technology to identify and verify a beneficiary 
the beneficiary simply inserts a smart card into the pos device and is prompted to present his fingerprint 
if the fingerprint matches the one stored on the smart card  the smart card is loaded with the value created for that particular smart card 
the smart card provides the holder with access to all of the ueps functionality  which includes the ability to have the smart card funded with pension or welfare payments  make retail purchases  enjoy the convenience of pre paid facilities and qualify for a range of affordable financial services  including insurance and short term loans 
the smart card also offers the card holder the ability to make debit order payments to a variety of third parties  including utility companies  schools and retail merchants  with which the holder maintains an account 
the card holder can also use the smart card as a savings account 
our ueps social grant distribution technology provides numerous benefits to government agencies and beneficiaries 
the system offers provincial governments a reliable service at a reasonable price 
for beneficiaries  our smart card offers convenience  security  affordability and flexibility 
they can avoid long waiting lines at payment locations and do not have to get to payment locations on scheduled payment dates to receive cash 
they do not lose money if they lose their smart cards  since a lost smart card is replaceable and the biometric fingerprint identification technology helps prevent fraud 
their personal security risks are reduced since they do not have to safeguard their cash 
beneficiaries have access to affordable financial services  can save and earn interest on their smart cards and can perform money transfers to friends and relatives living in other provinces 
finally  beneficiaries pay no transaction charges to load their smart cards  perform balance inquiries  make purchases or downloads or effect monthly debit orders 
for us  the system allows us to reduce our operating costs by reducing the amount of cash we have to transport 
the business unit has been allocated to our transaction based activities and smart card accounts reporting segments

net uta is a market leader in smart card based payment systems in the cis with the national interbank payment system in uzbekistan and a nationwide smart card payment system in russia 
net uta has historically employed a business model which focused on selling its product offering into various countries 
in contrast  our service based business model focuses on generating recurring revenues from our cardholder base through transaction based fees  financial services and value added products 
we believe that the geographical footprint of net austria is now large enough to allow us to overlay our service based model onto the various duet systems operating in russia and other countries  thereby creating new revenue streams for net uta and system operators 
since we acquired net austria in august  it has enhanced its product offering by leveraging our group technology platforms and information technology development resources 
we believe that our technological leadership in fields such as biometric identification and in the integration of our ueps technology with global systems for mobile communications  or gsm  will allow us to create new business opportunities for net uta such as national identification  voting and welfare distribution systems and mobile payment solutions 
we expect that the addition of net uta s skilled human resources in the information technology area will greatly assist us in the ongoing development of our technologies and maintenance of our existing systems 
net austria focuses its marketing efforts on markets in central and eastern europe  russia and other cis members  the middle east excluding iraq  india and asia 
net uta s revenue has declined unexpectedly as a result of the difficult market and trading conditions in its traditional markets 
these recent difficulties resulted in indefinite delays in the conclusion of certain expected significant business development opportunities

financial services cluster finance holdings our finance holdings business unit is responsible for identifying financial services products that can be provided to our ueps cardholders in south africa and then marketing and implementing the provision of those products 
we currently provide micro loans to our ueps cardholders who receive social welfare grants through our system in the kwazulu natal and northern cape provinces 
we provide the loans ourselves and generate revenue from the service fees charged on these loans 
we also sell life insurance products on behalf of registered underwriters and earn revenue through the commissions we receive on the sale of policies 
our wage payment system offers wage earners a ueps card that allows them to receive payment  transact and access other financial services in a secure  cost effective way 
the target markets for our wage payment system are the unbanked and underbanked wage earners in south africa  estimated at five million people 
these wage earners are typically paid in cash and thus have all the risks associated with carrying cash but none of the benefits associated with having a formal bank account 
in january  we signed a co operation agreement with grindrod bank  a fully registered bank in south africa  for the establishment of a retail banking division within grindrod bank that will focus on deploying our wage payment solution in south africa

corporate cluster the corporate cluster provides global support services to the net business units  joint ventures and investments for the following activities the group executive is responsible for the overall group management  defining the group s global strategy  investor relations and corporate finance activities 
the finance and administration unit provides group support in the areas of accounting  treasury  human resources  administration  legal  secretarial  taxation  compliance and internal audit 
the group information technology unit defines the group it strategy and the overall systems architecture and is responsible for the identification and management of the group s research and development activities 
the joint ventures and investments unit provides governance support to our joint ventures and assists with the evaluation of new investment opportunities 
competition in addition to competition that we face from the use of cash  checks  credit and debit cards  existing payment systems and the providers of financial services  there are a number of other products that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system 
while it is impossible for us to estimate the total number of competitors in the global payments marketplace  we believe that the most competitive product in this marketplace is emv  a system that is promoted by visa inc  mastercard international and europay international 
in addition  the jcb international credit card co 
ltd  diners club international and american express compare are currently among the largest global processors of payment transactions 
the competitive advantage of our ueps offering is that our technology can operate real time  but in an off line environment  using biometric identification instead of the standard personal identification number  or pin  methodology employed by our competitors 
we estimate that we process less than of all global payment transactions in the international marketplace 
in south africa  and specifically in the payment of social welfare grants  our competitors include allpay consolidated investment holdings pty ltd  or allpay  which is responsible for social welfare payments in the free state  gauteng and western cape provinces and a small portion of the eastern cape province  and empilweni payout services  or empilweni  which is responsible for payments in the mpumalanga province 
the south african banks and the south african post office  or sapo  also offer beneficiaries the option to open bank accounts that enable the beneficiaries to receive their welfare grants through the formal banking payment networks 
we compete primarily on the basis of the innovative nature and security of our technology 
we are able to load social welfare grants on behalf of the south african government directly onto a biometrically secured ueps smart card in rural areas where there is little or no infrastructure or in semi urban areas through our merchant acquiring system 
our ueps enabled smart cards are therefore used as a means of identification  security and as a transacting instrument 
grants loaded onto our ueps enabled smart cards can be used both online and offline and beneficiaries pay no monthly account or transaction fees 
the usefulness of a traditional bank card to its holder is dependent on the availability of a branch network  automatic teller machine  or atm  infrastructure and merchants accepting the card 
access to bank branches  atms and merchants accepting traditional bank cards are limited or non existent in the rural areas of south africa 
we believe the security  functionality and simplicity of our smart card provides us with a unique ability to service these rural areas of south africa 
our technology eliminates the risk associated with receiving social welfare grants in cash as well as the costs associated with transaction fees charged by banks when beneficiaries exceed the minimum number of free transactions per month 
we believe that sassa considers the technology utilized  pricing of the payment service rendered and other factors such as black economic empowerment  or bee  rating as the most important factors when considering potential service providers 
we compete with other service providers on these aspects through sassa s tender processes  when applicable  or through contract extension negotiations 
we own easypay  the largest bank independent switch in south africa 
easypay s competitors include bankservafrica  ecentric and eft pos 
bankservafrica is the largest transaction processor in south africa which processes all transactions on behalf of the south african banks and claims to process in excess of billion transactions valued at zar trillion annually 
during fiscal  easypay processed million transactions with an approximate value of zar billion  or approximately of the transaction volume processed by bankservafrica 
we also may face competition from companies to which we have licensed rights to our technology 
moreover  as our product offerings increase and gain market acceptance  banks in south africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as disrupting their eft transacting businesses 
research and development during fiscal  and  we incurred research and development expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
these expenditures consist primarily of the salaries of our software engineers and developers 
our research and development activities relate primarily to the continual revision and improvement of our core ueps software and its functionality and the design and development of our mobile virtual card  or mvc  concept 
for example  we continually advance our security protocols and algorithms as well as develop new ueps features that we believe will enhance the attractiveness of our product and service offerings 
our research and development efforts also focus on taking advantage of improvements in the hardware platforms that are not proprietary to us but which form part of our system 
intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to develop  maintain and protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws  as well as non disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property 
our fts patents  which include aspects of the ueps technology  are in effect in the united states  hong kong  south africa  botswana and swaziland 
the fts patent in the united states was granted as us patent no 
 on december  the patent was reissued as us patent no 
re  on july   and will expire on may  the fts patent in hong kong was granted on december   and expired in the fts patents in south africa  botswana  and swaziland were granted on september   march   and december   respectively 
our fts patents expire in september in south africa and swaziland and in march in botswana 
during fiscal  we continued the filing of the following three new patents on a world wide basis pct patent application no pct filing date title pct ib november  verification of a transactor s identity pct ib november  designation of electronic financial transactions pct ib november  virtual card we hold a number of trademarks in various countries 
financial information about geographical areas and operating segments during the last three fiscal years  we derived substantially all of our revenue from customers located in south africa and substantially all of our assets were located in south africa  except that in fiscal and  respectively  we derived material revenues from a customer in ghana and in from a customer in the russian federation and in fiscal and  a material portion of our assets were located in austria 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our operating segments 
employees as of june   we had  employees 
on a segmental basis  employees were part of our management   were employed in transaction based activities  were employed in financial services and were employed in smart card  hardware  software and related technology sales and corporate activities

as of june   approximately of the employees we have in the limpopo province who were performing transaction based activities were members of the south african commercial catering and allied workers union 
we believe we have a good relationship with our employees and these unions 
corporate history net was incorporated in florida in may until june  net was a development stage company and its business consisted only of acquiring a license to the us fts patent and obtaining an exclusive marketing agreement for the ueps technology outside south africa  namibia  botswana and swaziland 
in june  net acquired net applied technologies holdings limited  or aplitec  a public company listed on the jse limited  or jse 
aplitec owned the fts patent in south africa  namibia  botswana and swaziland and one of its subsidiaries was the other party to the marketing agreement described above 
the primary purpose of the aplitec transaction was to consolidate into one group the intellectual property rights relating to the fts patent and the ueps technology  to establish a first mover advantage in developing economies for the commercialization of the ueps technology  and to exploit market opportunities for growth through strategic alliances and acquisitions 
the transaction permitted aplitec s shareholders to reinvest the sale proceeds in net  but under south african exchange control regulations  those shareholders were not permitted to hold net s securities directly 
in october  net listed on the jse  in a secondary listing  which enabled the former aplitec shareholders as well as south african residents generally to hold net common stock directly 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the equity instruments held by aplitec shareholders from june to october available information we maintain an internet website at www

item a 
risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and the trading price of our common stock 
risks relating to our business we currently derive approximately of our revenues from the social welfare grants distribution service that we perform for sassa 
our latest contract with sassa  dated august   expires on march   and we may be required to bid with competitors for a new contract which may not be awarded to us 
if we were to discontinue providing our distribution service to sassa  we would lose all of these revenues 
we currently derive a substantial majority of our revenues from the social welfare grants distribution service that we perform for sassa  whereby we distribute these grants in five of the nine provinces of south africa 
for the foreseeable future  our revenues  results of operations and cash flows will depend on this activity 
during the years ended june   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues from our contract with sassa to distribute social welfare grants 
on august   we entered into a new service level agreement with sassa which expires on march   and we expect that we may be required to bid with competitors for a new contract 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining a new contract and were to discontinue providing our distribution service to sassa  we would lose all of these revenues 
in early  sassa commenced a national tender for the award of contracts to distribute social welfare grants throughout south africa 
we participated in the tender process and timely submitted proposals for each of south africa s nine provinces  as well as a proposal for the entire country 
there were a series of extensive delays during the tender process which resulted in numerous extensions of our bid proposals as well as an extension of our existing contracts 
on november   sassa notified bidders that it had terminated the tender process without awarding new contracts  citing a number of defects in the original request for proposal published by sassa and in the bid evaluation process 
in late march  we signed a new one year contract with sassa which expired on march  and which was subsequently extended to june  we signed a new agreement with sassa on august  sassa has stated that it may commence a new tender process at any time 
sassa s decision to terminate the original tender process and the ensuing short term agreements have created substantial uncertainty about the timing and ultimate outcome of the future contract award process 
once sassa initiates a new tender process  we cannot assure you that the tender will result in our receiving a contract to continue to distribute social welfare grants in each of the five south african provinces where we currently distribute them 
if we do not receive a new contract or if we were to discontinue providing our payment service to sassa  we could lose a substantial majority of our revenues 
even if we do receive a new contract  or one or more extensions of the existing contract  we cannot predict the terms that such contracts will contain 
any new contract or extension we receive may contain pricing or other terms  such as provisions relating to early termination  that could be unfavorable to us 
it is also possible that any new tender specification would include a requirement for the successful bidder to pre fund the social welfare grants in the relevant province for a one month period  as we were required to do under certain of our previous provincial contracts  which would result in significant cash flow funding requirements for the contractor 
the previous tender process and the negotiation of the new contract and subsequent extensions have consumed a substantial amount of our management s time and attention during the past three years 
any future tender initiated by sassa would require our management to devote further resources to the tender process which could adversely affect their ability to focus on other matters  including potential international business development activities 
in addition  we have sued sassa challenging  among other things  the cancellation of the previous tender process 
we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation  or whether or how such litigation will affect the outcome of any future tender process 
moreover  even if we were to receive a new contract or contract extensions containing similar economic terms to those of our current contract  our profit margin could be adversely affected to the extent that any such contracts would require us to incur significant capital expenditures during the initial implementation phase 
historically  we have incurred a significant portion of the expenses associated with these contracts during the initial implementation phase  which averages approximately months  and have historically enjoyed higher profit margins on these contracts after the completion of the implementation period 
therefore  to the extent that we were to be awarded a new contract that required significant capital expenditures  our profit margins would be adversely affected if the contract were to be terminated for any reason during the implementation period 
finally  if we were to be awarded one or more contracts by sassa  an unsuccessful tenderor could seek to challenge the award  which could result in the contract being set aside or could require us to expend time and resources in an attempt to defeat any such challenge 
our new contract with sassa is less favorable to us than our previous contract which we expect to adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow for fiscal furthermore  the terms of any further renewals or extensions or a contract awarded under a future tender process may be even less favorable to us than the current contract 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in diversifying our business and reducing our dependence on sassa  our business and profitability will likely suffer 
on august   we entered into a new service level agreement with sassa which replaces our previous sassa contract that expired on june  the new agreement is retroactively effective from july   and expires on march  the new contract contains a standard pricing formula for all provinces based on a transaction fee per beneficiary paid  regardless of the number or amount of grants paid per beneficiary  calculated on a guaranteed minimum number of beneficiaries per month 
however  the new contract provides for a reduction in both the level of the transaction fee per beneficiary paid and the guaranteed minimum number of beneficiaries 
because we continue to derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from our sassa contract  we expect that the terms of the new contract will materially reduce our revenues  operating income  net income and cash flow for fiscal further  as described in the preceding risk factor  it is possible that any further extension or renewal of the current contract or even a contract which we may be awarded under a future tender process may be even less favorable to us 
while we are making significant efforts to reduce our dependence on our sassa contract by diversifying our business in south africa and expanding internationally  to the extent that these efforts are not successful  we may not be able to offset the effects of the current and possible future less favorable terms from sassa which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we may undertake acquisitions that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business 
acquisitions are a significant part of our long term growth strategy as we seek to grow our business internationally and to deploy our technologies in new markets both inside and outside south africa 
however  we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate 
if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition  finance the acquisition or  if the acquisition occurs  integrate the acquired business into our existing business 
these transactions may require debt financing or additional equity financing  resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership 
acquisitions of businesses or other material operations and the integration of these acquisitions will require significant attention from our senior management which may divert their attention from our day to day business 
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
we also may not be able to maintain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates 
in addition  we may need to record write downs from future impairments of intangible assets  which could reduce our future reported earnings 
as an example  we have determined to record a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our august acquisition of net uta 
finally  acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition 
we have recorded and may need to record additional impairment charges relating to our businesses 
we assess the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently  whenever events occur and circumstances change indicating potential impairment 
we perform our annual impairment test as of june of each year 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized an impairment loss of approximately million on goodwill allocated to the hardware  software and related technology sales segment as a result of deteriorating trading conditions of this segment  particularly at net uta  and uncertainty surrounding contract finalization dates which will impact future cash flows 
a further deterioration in the hardware  software and related technology sales segment  or in any other of our businesses  may lead to additional impairments in future periods 
it may be difficult for us to implement our acquisition strategy in light of global market and economic conditions 
we believe that it is frequently desirable to issue equity or equity linked securities  as full or partial consideration for strategic acquisitions 
however  our stock price suffered a substantial decline during the second quarter of fiscal and continues to trade well below its historic trading levels 
the decline in our stock price has reduced the feasibility of our pursuing acquisitions in which we would issue our stock  at least in the near term 
in addition  the conditions in the global credit markets and other related trends affecting the banking industry have caused significant operating losses and bankruptcies throughout the banking industry which has made acquisition financing more difficult to obtain 
if our stock price remains too low to serve as acquisition currency or if we are unable to obtain acquisition financing  we may be unable to take advantage of potential acquisitions or to otherwise expand our business as planned 
a prolonged economic slowdown or lengthy or severe recession in south africa or elsewhere could harm our operations 
a prolonged economic downturn or recession could materially impact our results from operations 
a recessionary economic environment could have a negative impact on mobile phone operators  our cardholders and retailers and could reduce the level of transactions we process and the take up of financial services we offer  which would  in turn  negatively impact our financial results 
if financial institutions and retailers experience decreased demand for their products and services our hardware  software and related technology sales will reduce  resulting in lower revenue 
the loss of the services of dr 
belamant or any of our other executive officers would adversely affect our business 
our future financial and operational performance depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our senior management  in particular  dr 
serge belamant  our chief executive officer and chairman and herman kotze  our chief financial officer 
many of our key responsibilities are performed by these two individuals  and the loss of the services of either of them could disrupt our development efforts or business relationships and our ability to continue to innovate and to meet customers needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
we do not have employment agreements with our executive officers and they may terminate their employment at any time 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we face a highly competitive employment market and may not be successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled employees  particularly in the technical and sales areas and senior management 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop new products and to market these products to our target users 
in order to succeed in our product development and marketing efforts  we need to identify  attract  motivate and retain sufficient numbers of qualified technical and sales personnel 
an inability to hire and retain such technical personnel would adversely affect our ability to enhance our existing intellectual property  to introduce new generations of technology and to keep abreast of current developments in technology 
demand for personnel with the range of capabilities and experience we require is high and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining these employees 
the risk exists that our technical skills and sales base may be depleted over time because of natural attrition 
furthermore  social and economic factors in south africa have led  and continue to lead  numerous qualified individuals to leave the country  thus depleting the availability of qualified personnel in south africa 
in addition  our multi country strategy will also require us to hire and retain highly qualified managerial personnel in each of these markets 
if we cannot recruit and retain people with the appropriate capabilities and experience and effectively integrate these people into our business  it could negatively affect our product development and marketing activities 
we face competition from the incumbent retail banks in south africa in the unbanked market segment  which could limit growth in our transaction based activities segment 
the incumbent south african retail banks have created a common banking product  generally referred to as a mzansi account  for unbanked south africans  which offers limited transactional capabilities at reduced charges  when compared to the accounts traditionally offered by these banks 
according to the finscope survey  which is an annual survey conducted by the finmark trust  a non profit independent trust  approximately million and million people in south africa claimed to use a mzansi account in and  respectively 
in addition  the survey indicated that of those surveyed opened a mzansi account in order to receive a social welfare grant 
it is possible for a social welfare beneficiary to receive grants through a mzansi or other low cost banking account 
sassa does not pay us a fee for the disbursement of grants through mzansi or other low cost bank accounts and to the extent that beneficiaries use these accounts  rather than our smart card  to receive their grants  we will not be able to generate additional revenues from retail spending by these beneficiaries 
in contrast  when a beneficiary receives grants through our smart card  we are able to generate incremental revenues from the use of our card in our merchant acquiring system because merchants participating in our merchant acquiring systems are also able to accept ueps based smart cards 
thus  our ability to increase our revenues and operating margins will be adversely affected to the extent that there is an increase in the number or percentage of south africans using mzansi or other low cost bank accounts to receive their social welfare grants 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the sale of our products or services to that customer tends to be long and may be subject to delays which may have an impact on our revenues 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products and services is often long and subject to delays associated with the budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes that frequently accompany significant capital expenditures 
a lengthy sales cycle may have an impact on the timing of our revenues  which may cause our quarterly operating results to fall below investor expectations 
a customer s decision to purchase our products and services is often discretionary  involves a significant commitment of resources  and is influenced by customer budgetary cycles 
to sell our products and services successfully we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the uses and benefits of our products and services  which can require the expenditure of significant time and resources  however  there can be no assurance that this significant expenditure of time and resources will result in actual sales of our products and services 
we may face competition from other companies that offer smart card technology and other innovative payment technologies  which could result in loss of our existing business and adversely impact our ability to successfully market additional products and services 
in addition to competition that we face from the use of cash  checks  credit and debit cards  existing payment systems and the providers of financial services and low cost bank accounts such as mzansi  there are a number of other products that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system 
during the past several years  smart card technology has become increasingly prevalent 
we believe that the most competitive product in this marketplace is emv  a system that is promoted by visa inc  mastercard international and europay international 
our ability to maintain our existing south african government contracts could be adversely affected to the extent that  in the future  the promoters of any of these systems would choose to compete directly in the south african pension and welfare business 
we also may face competition from companies to which we have licensed our technology 
in  we entered into a technology license agreement with visa 
under that agreement  visa purchased a non exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license to our technology rights  as defined in the agreement  relating to our ueps technology and an exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license under our patents  as defined in the agreement  licensed to visa that is exclusive to the financial services industry  as defined in the agreement 
our visa agreement grants back to us the non exclusive right under our visa licensed patents to make  use and sell our payment systems and other products in the financial services industry as discussed in the agreement 
in our visa agreement  visa agrees not to grant a sublicense to any payment system to any entities in the financial services industry who are not members of visa already if such entity already has a right to use such payment systems from us 
the agreement permits visa to sublicense our licensed technology rights to any of its members  any entity in the financial services industry or any entity outside of the financial services industry that provides products to visa or its sublicensees 
the agreement prohibits us from licensing our technology rights  not just our licensed patents  to any of visa s competitors  including mastercard  europay  american express company  discover financial services  diners club international credit card co  carte blanche card or jcb international credit card co 
or any of their parents  subsidiaries or affiliates 
we may need visa s consent  not to be unreasonably withheld  in order to transfer or assign our rights and obligations under the agreement 
as this agreement does not contain a termination date and contains restrictions on our ability to license our technology rights in the financial services industry and to competitors of visa  we may not be able to realize the full value of our technology rights 
moreover  as our product offerings increase and gain market acceptance  banks in south africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as disrupting their funds transfer or other businesses 
system failures  including breaches in the security of our system  could harm our business 
we may experience system failures from time to time  and any lengthy interruption in the availability of our back end system computer could harm our revenues and profits  and could subject us to the scrutiny of our government customers 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers and users to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to avoid our technology altogether  and could permanently harm our reputation and brands 
these interruptions would increase the burden on our engineering staff  which  in turn  could delay our introduction of new applications and services 
finally  because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim could be time consuming and costly for us to address 
although our systems have been designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks and similar events 
some of our systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
protection against fraud is of key importance to the purchasers and end users of our solutions 
we incorporate security features  including encryption software  biometric identification and secure hardware  into our solutions to protect against fraud in electronic transactions and to provide for the privacy and integrity of card holder data 
our solutions may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to defects in the security mechanisms  the operating system and applications or the hardware platform 
security vulnerabilities could jeopardize the security of information transmitted using our solutions 
if the security of our solutions is compromised  our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our solutions will be adversely affected  which would cause our business to suffer  and we may become subject to damage claims 
we have not yet experienced any security breaches affecting our business 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our system could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
our current business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
the failure of any bank or financial institution in which we keep our cash and cash equivalents may prevent us from funding our business or may lead to substantial losses of assets 
we maintain a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents to fund our business operations at several major south african and european banks and financial institutions 
as of june   we maintained an aggregate of million in cash and cash equivalents which were deposited with such banks and financial institutions 
although we maintain a policy of entering into transactions only with south african and european banks and financial institutions that have ratings acceptable to our board  as determined by credit rating agencies such as standard poor s  moody s and fitch ratings  due to the recent credit crisis and global economic conditions  it is possible that despite such ratings  one or more of these banks or financial institutions may fail 
the failure of one or more of these institutions may cause us to lose a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition to the actual value of our company which would be reduced due to the loss of cash and cash equivalents  our business could be materially and adversely affected by the failure of any institution where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents 
although to date we have not experienced any such losses or been prevented from funding our business operations  in light of recent global economic conditions such losses may occur in the future 
our strategy of partnering with companies outside south africa may not be successful 
in order for us to expand our operations into foreign markets  it may be necessary for us to establish partnering arrangements with companies outside south africa  such as the ones we have established in namibia  botswana  nigeria  colombia and vietnam 
the success of these endeavors is  however  subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control  such as finding suitable partners with the appropriate financial  business and technical backing and continued governmental support for planned implementations 
in some countries  finding suitable partners and obtaining the appropriate support from the government involved may take a number of years before we can commence implementation 
some of these partnering arrangements may take the form of joint ventures in which we receive a minority interest 
minority ownership carries with it numerous risks  including dependence on partners to provide knowledge of local market conditions and to facilitate the acquisition of any necessary licenses and permits  as well as the inability to control the joint venture vehicle and to direct its policies and strategies 
such a lack of control could result in the loss of all or part of our investment in such entities 
in addition  our foreign partners may have different business methods and customs which may be unfamiliar to us and with which we disagree 
our joint venture partners may not be able to implement our business model in new areas as efficiently and quickly as we have been able to do in south africa 
furthermore  limitations imposed on net applied technologies south africa limited  or new aplitec  by south african exchange control regulations  as well as limitations imposed on us by the investment company act of  may limit our ability to establish partnerships or entities in which we do not obtain a controlling interest 
in addition  certain of our licensees  including visa  have become our competitors and this could occur with our joint venture partners in the future 
we may have difficulty managing our growth  especially as we expand our business internationally 
we continue to experience growth  both in the scope of our operations and size of our organization 
this growth is placing significant demands on our management  especially as we expand our business internationally 
continued growth would increase the challenges involved in implementing appropriate operational and financial systems  expanding our technical and sales and marketing infrastructure and capabilities  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards  and preserving our culture and values 
international growth  in particular  means that we must become familiar and comply with complex laws and regulations in other countries  especially laws relating to taxation 
additionally  continued growth will place significant additional demands on our management and our financial and operational resources  and will require that we continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls 
if we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately  we will not experience our projected growth and our financial results may suffer 
we pre fund the payment of social welfare grants through our merchant acquiring system and a significant level of payment defaults by these merchants would adversely affect us 
we pre fund social welfare grants through the merchants who participate in our merchant acquiring system in the provinces where we operate 
these pre funding obligations expose us to the risk of default by these merchants 
although we have not experienced any material defaults by merchants in the return of pre funded amounts to us  we cannot guarantee that material defaults will not occur in the future 
a material level of merchant defaults could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial position and results of operations 
we may incur material losses in connection with our distribution of cash to recipients of social welfare grants 
many social welfare recipients use our services to access cash using their smart cards 
we use armored vehicles to deliver large amounts of cash to rural areas across south africa to enable these welfare recipients to receive this cash 
in some cases  we also store the cash that will be delivered by the armored vehicles in depots overnight or over the weekend to facilitate delivery to these rural areas 
we cannot insure against the risk of loss or theft of cash from our delivery vehicles as we have not identified any insurance underwriters willing to accept this risk on reasonable terms 
therefore  we will bear the full cost of any loss or theft in connection with the delivery process  and such loss could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the company did not incur any material losses resulting from cash distribution during fiscal  or  but there is no assurance that we will not incur material losses in the future 
we depend upon third party suppliers  making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations  which could harm our business 
we obtain our smart cards  pos devices and the other hardware we use in our business from a limited number of suppliers  and do not manufacture this equipment ourselves 
we generally do not have long term agreements with our manufacturers or component suppliers 
if our suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of parts or products when we need them  or if they increase their prices  we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and could be faced with a critical shortage 
this could harm our ability to implement new systems and cause our revenues to decline 
even if we are able to secure alternative sources in a timely manner  our costs could increase 
a supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond current suppliers capabilities could harm our ability to distribute our equipment and thus  to acquire a new source of customers who use our ueps technology 
any interruption in the supply of the hardware necessary to operate our technology  or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a timely manner  could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers  which would have an adverse effect on our business 
shipments of our electronic payment systems may be delayed by factors outside of our control  which can harm our reputation and our relationships with our customers 
the shipment of payment systems requires us or our manufacturers  distributors or other agents to obtain customs or other government certifications and approvals and  on occasion  to submit to physical inspection of our systems in transit 
failure to satisfy these requirements  and the very process of trying to satisfy them  can lead to lengthy delays in the delivery of our solutions to our direct or indirect customers 
delays and unreliable delivery by us may harm our reputation and our relationships with our customers 
risks relating to operating in south africa and other emerging markets fluctuations in the value of the south african rand have had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our reported results of operations  which may make it difficult to evaluate our business performance between reporting periods and may also adversely affect our stock price 
the south african rand  or zar  is the primary operating currency for our business operations while our financial results are reported in us dollars 
this means that as long as the zar remains our primary operating currency  depreciation in the zar against the us dollar  and to a lesser extent  the euro  would negatively impact our reported revenue and net income  while a strengthening of the zar would have the opposite effect 
depreciation in the zar may negatively impact the prices at which our stock trades 
the us dollar zar exchange rate has historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue 
the zar was significantly weaker overall during than during and  which negatively affected our reported results of operations when compared to and we provide detailed information about historical exchange rates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currency exchange rate information 
due to the significant fluctuation in the value of the zar and its impact on our reported results  you may find it difficult to compare our results of operations between financial reporting periods even though we provide supplemental information about our results of operations determined on a zar basis 
this difficulty may increase as we expand our business internationally and record additional revenue and expenses in the euro and other currencies 
it may also have a negative impact on our stock price 
we generally do not engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations  other than economic hedging relating to our inventory purchases which are settled in us dollars or euros 
we have used forward contracts in order to hedge our economic exposure to the zar us dollar and zar euro exchange rate fluctuations from these foreign currency transactions 
we cannot guarantee that we will enter into hedging transactions in the future or  if we do  that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations 
south africa s high levels of poverty  unemployment and crime may increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain a qualified workforce 
while south africa has a highly developed financial and legal infrastructure  it also has high levels of crime and unemployment and there are significant differences in the level of economic and social development among its people  with large parts of the population  particularly in the rural areas  having limited access to adequate education  healthcare  housing and other basic services  including water and electricity 
government policies aimed at alleviating and redressing the disadvantages suffered by the majority of citizens under previous governments may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  all of which could negatively affect our business 
these problems may prompt emigration of skilled workers  hinder investment into south africa and impede economic growth 
as a result  we may have difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees 
the economy of south africa is exposed to high inflation and interest rates which could increase our operating costs and thereby reduce our profitability 
the economy of south africa in the past has been  and in the future may continue to be  characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the united states and other highly developed economies 
high rates of inflation could increase our south african based costs and decrease our operating margins 
although higher interest rates would increase the amount of income we earn on our cash balances  they would also adversely affect our ability to obtain cost effective debt financing in south africa 
if we do not achieve applicable black economic empowerment objectives in our south african businesses  we risk losing our government and private contracts 
in addition  it is possible that we may be required to achieve black shareholding of our company in a manner that could dilute your ownership 
the south african government  through the broad based black economic empowerment act   established a legislative framework for the promotion of bee 
the law recognizes two distinct mechanisms for the achievement of bee objectives compliance with codes of good practice  which have already been issued  and compliance with industry specific transformation charters 
although the charter that will likely apply to our company has not yet been finalized  we believe it is likely that the charter will not differ substantially from the codes of good practice 
achievement of bee objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting to various components of bee 
one component of bee is achieving a certain percentage of shareholdings by black south africans in south african businesses over a period of years 
this shareholding component carries the highest bee scorecard weighting 
other components include procuring goods and services from black owned businesses or from businesses that have earned good bee scores and achieving certain levels of black south african employment 
compliance with the codes and applicable charters are not enforced through civil or criminal sanction  but compliance does affect the ability of a company to secure contracts in the public and private sectors 
thus  it will be important for us to achieve applicable bee objectives 
failing to do so could jeopardize our ability to maintain existing business  including our south african pension and welfare business  or to secure future business 
we have taken a number of actions as a company to increase empowerment of black south africans 
however  it is possible that these actions may not be sufficient to enable us to achieve applicable bee objectives 
in that event  in order to avoid risking the loss of our government and private contracts  we may have to seek to comply through other means  including by selling shares of net or of our south african subsidiaries to black south africans 
such sales of shares could have a dilutive impact of your ownership interest  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
south african exchange control regulations could hinder our ability to make foreign investments and obtain foreign denominated financing 
south africa s exchange control regulations restrict the export of capital from south africa  the republic of namibia and the kingdoms of lesotho and swaziland  known collectively as the common monetary area without the prior approval of sarb 
while the south african government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years  it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further relax or abolish exchange control measures in the foreseeable future 
although net is a us corporation and is not itself subject to south african exchange control regulations  these regulations do restrict the ability of our south african subsidiaries to raise and deploy capital outside the common monetary area  to borrow money in currencies other than the south african rand and to hold foreign currency 
exchange control restrictions may also affect the ability of these subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to net unless the affected subsidiary can show that any payment of such dividend will not place it in an over borrowed position 
as of june   approximately of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our south african subsidiaries 
exchange control regulations could make it difficult for our south african subsidiaries to i export capital from south africa  ii hold foreign currency or incur indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies without the approval of sarb  iii acquire an interest in a foreign venture without the approval of sarb and first having complied with the investment criteria of sarb  iv repatriate to south africa profits of foreign operations  and v limit our business to utilize profits of one foreign business to finance operations of a different foreign business 
under current exchange control regulations  sarb approval would be required for any acquisition of our company which would involve payment to our south african shareholders of any consideration other than south african rand 
this restriction could limit our management in its ability to consider strategic options and thus  our shareholders may not be able to realize the premium over the current trading price of our shares 
hiv aids and tuberculosis are major healthcare challenges in south africa and other sub saharan countries 
the prevalence of these diseases may force us to incur costs relating to the loss of personnel  reduction in the productivity of our workforce and recruiting and training of new personnel 
hiv aids and tuberculosis  which is exacerbated in the presence of hiv aids  are major healthcare challenges in south africa and other sub saharan countries 
we cannot estimate how much of our south african workforce may be infected with hiv aids  due to the high prevalence of hiv aids in south africa  we may incur costs relating to the loss of personnel and the related loss of productivity as well as medical costs and costs relating to recruiting and training of new personnel 
in addition  the potential for increased mortality rates due to hiv aids deaths to reduce or slow the growth of the south african population could adversely impact our growth 
most of these factors are beyond our control 
we are not able to quantify the impact of hiv aids on our growth or costs and cannot assure you that the costs we will incur in connection with this epidemic will not have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition and our operations 
most of south africa s major industries are unionized  and the majority of employees belong to trade unions 
we face the risk of disruption from labor disputes and new south african labor laws 
in the past  trade unions have had a significant impact on the collective bargaining process as well as on social and political reform in south africa in general 
although only approximately five percent of our workforce is unionized and we have not experienced any labor disruptions in recent years  such labor disruptions may occur in the future 
in addition  developments in south african labor laws may increase our costs or alter our relationship with our employees and trade unions  which may have an adverse effect on us  our financial condition and our operations 
operating in south africa and other emerging markets subjects us to greater risks than those we would face if we operated in more developed markets 
emerging markets such as south africa  as well as some of the other markets into which we have recently begun to expand  including african countries outside south africa  south america  southeast asia and central and eastern europe  are subject to greater risks than more developed markets 
while we focus our business primarily on emerging markets because that is where we perceive there to be the greatest opportunities to market our products and services successfully  the political  economic and market conditions in many of these markets present risks that could make it more difficult to operate our business successfully 
some of these risks include political and economic instability  including higher rates of inflation and currency fluctuations  high levels of corruption  including bribery of public officials  loss due to civil strife  acts of war or terrorism  guerrilla activities and insurrection  a lack of well developed legal systems which could make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights  logistical and communications challenges  potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including import and export license requirements and restrictions  tariffs  legal structures and tax laws  difficulties in staffing and managing operations and ensuring the safety of our employees  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  indigenization and empowerment programs  and exposure to liability under us securities and foreign trade laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  and regulations established by the us department of treasury s office of foreign assets control  or ofac 
many of these countries and regions are in various stages of developing institutions and political  legal and regulatory systems that are characteristic of democracies 
however  institutions in these countries and regions may not yet be as firmly established as they are in democracies in the developed world 
many of these countries and regions are also in the process of transitioning to a market economy and  as a result  are experiencing changes in their economies and their government policies that can affect our investments in these countries and regions 
moreover  the procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory regimes in these countries and regions are still being developed and  therefore  existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently 
in some circumstances  it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided under those laws and regulations in a timely manner 
as the political  economic and legal environments remain subject to continuous development  investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the security of their investments 
any unexpected changes in the political or economic conditions in these or neighboring countries or others in the region may have a material adverse effect on the international investments that we have made or may make in the future  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
risks relating to government regulation we are required to comply with certain us laws and regulations  including the foreign corrupt practices act as well as economic and trade sanctions  which could adversely impact our future growth 
we must comply with the fcpa  which prohibits us companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business  direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage 
in addition  ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries  entities and individuals based on us foreign policy and national security goals 
any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees  agents and business partners comply with the fcpa could subject us to substantial penalties 
in addition  the requirement that we comply with the fcpa could put us at a competitive disadvantage with companies that are not required to comply with the fcpa or could otherwise harm our business 
for example  in many emerging markets  there may be significant levels of official corruption  and thus  bribery of public officials may be a commonly accepted cost of doing business 
our refusal to engage in illegal behavior  such as paying bribes  may result in us not being able to obtain business that we might otherwise have been able to secure or possibly even result in unlawful  selective or arbitrary action being taken against us by foreign officials 
furthermore  the trade sanctions administered and enforced by ofac target countries which are typically less developed countries 
since less developed countries present some of the best opportunities for us to expand our business internationally  restrictions against entering into transactions with those foreign countries  as well as with certain entities and individuals in those countries  can adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
changes in current south african government regulations relating to social welfare grants could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows 
we derive a substantial portion of our current business from the distribution of social welfare grants onto smart cards in south africa and the transaction fees resulting from use of these smart cards 
because social welfare eligibility and grant amounts are regulated by the south african government  any changes to or reinterpretations of the government regulations relating to social welfare may result in the non renewal or reduction of grants for certain individuals  or a determination that currently eligible social welfare grant recipients are no longer eligible 
if any of these changes were to occur  the number of smart cards in use could decrease  the amount of money on any particular smart card could decrease or the amount of transactions effected on any particular smart card may decrease  all of which could result in a reduction of our revenues and cash flows 
we do not have a south african banking license and therefore we provide our wage payment solution through an arrangement with a third party bank  which limits our control over this business and the economic benefit we derive from it 
if this arrangement were to terminate  we would not be able to operate our wage payment business without alternate means of access to a banking license the south african retail banking market is highly regulated  but the south african government has identified the need to service the unbanked market through the liberalization of the regulatory environment in order for retailers and non banking service providers to innovate products and delivery channels for the unbanked market 
however  under current law and regulations  a portion of our south african wage payment business activities in the unbanked market requires us to be registered as a bank in south africa or to have access to an existing banking license 
we are not currently so registered  but we have entered into a co operation agreement with grindrod bank through which our wage payment solution is being implemented by grindrod bank s retail division 
as a result of this arrangement  we do not have complete control over the marketing and implementation of our wage payment system and we have to share the economic benefits with grindrod bank 
if the co operation agreement were to be terminated  we would not be able to operate our wage payment business unless we were able to obtain access to a banking license through alternate means 
in addition  the south african financial advisory and intermediary services act   requires persons who give advice regarding the purchase of financial products or who act as intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in south africa to register as financial service providers 
we have applied for a license under this act in order to continue to provide advice and intermediary services in respect of the financial products on which we advise and the payment processing services we provide in south africa on behalf of insurers and other financial product suppliers 
if we fail to obtain this license  we may be stopped from continuing this part of our business in south africa 
our payment processing businesses in south africa are subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by liability under  or any future inability to comply with  existing or future regulations or requirements 
our payment processing activities are subject to extensive regulation 
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non complying facility  the imposition of liens  fines and or civil or criminal liability 
we may be subject to privacy laws in south africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
compliance with these laws may adversely affect our ability to operate our business most effectively 
moreover  we could face liability for damages if we are found to have violated any of these privacy laws 
our collection  storage and processing  and any disclosure of  customer and employee personal information must comply with south africa s privacy laws  which are at various stages of legislative and judicial development 
however  south african common law and the constitution of the republic of south africa   do recognize an individual s right to privacy  and there are some statutes and other regulations which have been enacted that apply to us and the way we operate our business 
for example  one statute sets out a framework for the electronic collection  processing  storage and disclosure of personal information 
although compliance with this statute is voluntary  a south african court could determine that we would be violating an individual s right to privacy if we do not operate in compliance with this framework 
in addition  south african law requires that we must keep confidential the hiv status of the people that participate in any hiv aids program 
new privacy laws may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the way we do business  and we could be required to devote substantial management time and resources to comply with these new laws 
in addition  if we violate  or are judged to have violated  the privacy rights of people whose information we collect  store and process  we could become liable for damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
risks relating to intellectual property patent competition may adversely affect our products or processes  and limited patent protection  a lack of proprietary protection and the potential to incur costly litigation could be harmful to our operations 
our products and technology have unique characteristics and structures and  as a result  are subject to patent protection  the extent of which varies from country to country 
during the life of a patent  a product is only subject to competition by non infringing products 
however  aggressive patenting by our competitors and potential patent piracy may threaten protected products and processes and may result in an increased patent infringement risk  especially in emerging economies such as those where we currently operate 
the expiration of a patent may also result in increased competition in the market for the previously patented products and processes 
the patents for our fts will expire at various dates ending in lack of patent protection could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  to date  we have relied not only on patent protections  but also on trade secret  trademark and copyright laws  as well as nondisclosure  licensing and other contractual arrangements to protect the proprietary aspects of our solutions 
other than the patents discussed above  we do not own any other patents that protect important aspects of our current solutions 
we will  however  prepare patent applications where possible for technology related to our smart cards and ueps system when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
these applications and contractual arrangements and our reliance on these laws may not be successful 
litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets could result in substantial costs and may not be successful 
any loss of  or inability to protect  intellectual property in our technology could diminish our competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws in countries where we currently have patent protection 
our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in countries where we currently have patent protection or any other country in which we operate  may not be adequate to fully protect our intellectual property rights 
similarly  if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  we may be required to incur significant costs and devote substantial resources to the defense of such claims 
we may be required to discontinue using and selling any infringing technology and services  to expend resources to develop non infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties for other technology 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in defending any such third party claims  we could suffer costly judgments and injunctions that could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the copyrights and certain related intellectual property rights in earlier versions of our ueps software are jointly owned and potentially subject to non exclusive rights  which may reduce our future revenues 
while we own the exclusive copyrights in the current version of the ueps software  these copyrights are subject to the preexisting copyrights in the earlier versions of our software that are owned jointly by us and nedbank limited  or nedbank 
as joint owners of the copyrights in these earlier versions of our software that existed prior to july  there is a risk that nedbank could license these works to others and otherwise commercially exploit these earlier works 
under our nedbank agreements  nedbank also acquired the right to request a license of our south african and us fts patents and of all technology and know how relating to the ueps described in those earlier patents from us for entities partly owned by nedbank that are located anywhere within south africa and neighboring countries 
under these licenses  nedbank would pay us a license fee  with us supplying smart cards or being paid a royalty if the cards are obtained from a third party 
if nedbank licenses our works to others or otherwise commercially exploits our technology and know how related to ueps  our future revenues may be reduced 
our current license agreement with visa imposes long term restrictions on our ability to license rights in our technology and could inhibit our ability to realize additional revenue from these rights in our technology 
in  we entered into a technology license agreement with visa 
under that agreement  visa purchased a non exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license to our technology rights  as defined in the agreement  relating to our ueps technology and an exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license under our patents  as defined in the agreement  licensed to visa that is exclusive to the financial services industry  as defined in the agreement 
our visa agreement grants back to us the non exclusive right under our visa licensed patents to make  use and sell our payment systems and other products in the financial services industry as discussed in the agreement 
in our visa agreement  visa agrees not to grant a sublicense to any payment system to any entities in the financial services industry who are not members of visa already if such entity already has a right to use such payment systems from us 
the agreement permits visa to sublicense our licensed technology rights to any of its members  any entity in the financial services industry or any entity outside of the financial services industry that provides products to visa or its sublicensees 
the agreement prohibits us from licensing our technology rights  not just our licensed patents  to any of visa s competitors  including mastercard  europay  american express company  discover financial services  diners club international credit card co  carte blanche card or jcb international credit card co 
or any of their parents  subsidiaries or affiliates 
we may need visa s consent  not to be unreasonably withheld  in order to transfer or assign our rights and obligations under the agreement 
as this agreement does not contain a termination date and contains restrictions on our ability to license our technology rights in the financial services industry and to competitors of visa  we may not be able to realize the full value of our technology rights 
our license agreement with visa substantially impacts our ability to defend and enforce our patents licensed to visa and could substantially inhibit our ability to protect the rights in our technology 
under our license agreement with visa  we are restricted from suing visa  its members and any third party vendors or customers of visa or its members for infringement of our technology rights licensed to visa in connection with their manufacture  use or sale of any product or service offered by visa 
the license also grants visa sole discretion with regard to enforcement of any of the licensed technology rights against third parties in the financial services industry 
under the agreement  visa has the right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and related patent applications we have licensed to visa in all jurisdictions  and we are obligated to cooperate and support any of visa s actions in this regard 
this arrangement could substantially impact our ability to defend these patents  and could make enforcement actions against our competitors more difficult 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has experienced recent significant volatility 
during the fiscal year  our stock price ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect that the trading price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to the following developments or the absence of developments in obtaining a new tender or contract from sassa  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  particularly the us dollar zar exchange rate  quarterly variations in our operating results  especially if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  announcements of acquisitions or disposals  the timing of or delays in the commencement  implementation or completion of major projects  large purchases or sales of our common stock  general conditions in the markets in which we operate  and economic and financial conditions 
in particular  differences in relative growth rates between our businesses in our established markets for certain products and unestablished markets may have a significant effect on our operating results  particularly our reported operating profit margin  in any individual quarter  with unestablished market sales typically carrying lower margins in the initial phases of our operations in a new area or the introduction of a new product to an area in which we already operate 
certain transactions are difficult to predict and may have a significant effect on our operating results 
sales of this nature include hardware sales to customers and to our smartswitch investments and cause fluctuations in revenue and operating income when they occur 
we may seek to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock 
we may require additional financing to fund future operations  including expansion in current and new markets  programming development and acquisition  capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies  or to fund acquisitions 
because of the exposure to market risks associated with economies in emerging markets  we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced  and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the market price and voting power of shares of common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities  the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock  and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us 
we may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations or acquisitions as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock 
in recent years  the securities markets in the united states have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations  performances  underlying asset values or prospects of such companies 
for these reasons  our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control 
if our business development plans are successful  we may require additional financing to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies  to expand into new markets and to make acquisitions  all of which may be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means 
issuances of significant amounts of stock in the future could potentially dilute your equity ownership and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our common stock in order to provide us with the flexibility to issue shares for business purposes that may arise from time to time 
for example  we could sell additional shares to raise capital to fund our operations or to acquire other businesses  issue additional shares under our stock incentive plan or declare a stock dividend 
our board may authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock without notice to  or further action by  our shareholders  unless shareholder approval is required by law or the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
the issuance of additional shares could dilute the equity ownership of our current shareholders 
in addition  additional shares that we issue would likely be freely tradable which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  especially over companies that we may acquire  could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
our management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june   excluded the operations of medikredit and fihrst 
if we are not able to integrate medikredit and fihrst s operations into our internal control over financial reporting  our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sarbanes  we are required to furnish a management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we are required to report  among other things  control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal control that materially affect  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  internal control over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
the requirement to evaluate and report on our internal controls also applies to companies that we acquire 
as private companies  medikredit and fihrst were not required to comply with sarbanes prior to the acquisitions by us 
the integration of these operations into our internal control over financial reporting has required significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs 
as permitted by sec rules  our management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june   excluded the operations of medikredit and fihrst 
if we fail to successfully integrate these operations into our internal control over financial reporting  our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective 
while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting  including with respect to the medikredit and fihrst operations  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market s perception of our business and our stock price 
you may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process  enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions based upon us laws  including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws  against us or our directors and officers and experts 
while net is incorporated in the state of florida  united states  the company is headquartered in johannesburg  south africa and substantially all of the company s assets are located outside the united states 
in addition  the majority of net s directors and officers reside outside of the united states and our experts  including our independent registered public accountants  are based in south africa 
as a result  even though you could effect service of legal process upon net  as a florida corporation  in the united states  you may not be able to collect any judgment obtained against net in the united states  including any judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws  because substantially all of our assets are located outside the united states 
moreover  it may not be possible for you to effect service of legal process upon the majority of our directors and officers or upon our experts within the united states or elsewhere outside south africa and any judgment obtained against any of our foreign directors  officers and experts in the united states  including one based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws  may not be collectible in the united states and may not be enforced by a south african court 
a foreign judgment is not directly enforceable in south africa  but constitutes a cause of action which will be enforced by south african courts provided that the court or arbitral body which pronounced the judgment had international jurisdiction and competence to entertain the case according to the principles recognized by south african law with reference to the jurisdiction of foreign courts  the judgment is final and conclusive that is  it cannot be altered by the court which pronounced it  the judgment has not lapsed  the recognition and enforcement of the judgment by south african courts would not be contrary to public policy in south africa  including observance of the rules of natural justice which require that no award is enforceable unless the defendant was duly served with documents initiating proceedings  that he was given a fair opportunity to be heard and that he enjoyed the right to be legally represented in a free and fair trial before an impartial tribunal  the judgment was not obtained by improper or fraudulent means  the judgment does not involve the enforcement of a penal or foreign revenue law or any award of multiple or punitive damages  and the enforcement of the judgment is not otherwise precluded by the provisions of the protection of business act of as amended  of the republic of south africa 
it has been the policy of south african courts to award compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained by the person to whom the compensation is awarded 
south african courts have awarded compensation to shareholders who have suffered damages as a result of a diminution in the value of their shares based on various actions by the corporation and its management 
although the award of punitive damages is generally unknown to the south african legal system  that does not mean that such awards are necessarily contrary to public policy 
whether a judgment was contrary to public policy depends on the facts of each case 
exorbitant  unconscionable  or excessive awards will generally be contrary to public policy 
south african courts cannot enter into the merits of a foreign judgment and cannot act as a court of appeal or review over the foreign court 
further  if a foreign judgment is enforced by a south african court  it will be payable in south african currency 
also  under south africa s exchange control laws  the approval of sarb is required before a defendant resident in south africa may pay money to a non resident plaintiff in satisfaction of a foreign judgment enforced by a court in south africa 
it is doubtful whether an original action based on united states federal securities laws may be brought before south african courts 
a plaintiff who is not resident in south africa may be required to provide security for costs in the event of proceedings being initiated in south africa 
furthermore  the rules of the high court of south africa require that documents executed outside south africa must be authenticated for the purpose of use in south african courts 
in reaching the foregoing conclusions  we consulted with our south african legal counsel  cliffe dekker hofmeyr inc we may become subject to a us tax liability for failing to withhold on certain distributions on instruments issued in connection with the aplitec transaction 
there is no statutory  judicial or administrative authority that directly addresses the tax treatment of non us holders that elected to receive units in a trust representing beneficial interests in b class preference shares and b class loan accounts issued by new aplitec pursuant to the reinvestment option in connection with our acquisition of aplitec 
we believe these interests should be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as  and we did treat them as  separate and distinct interests in new aplitec 
as such  we and our affiliates did not withhold any amounts for us federal taxes in respect of any distributions paid on such interests 
there is a risk  however  that these interests  together with the special convertible preferred stock  may be treated as representing a single direct equity interest in us for us federal income tax purposes 
in such case  distributions received with respect to the b class preference shares and b class loan accounts could be subject to us federal withholding tax  and we could be liable for failure to withhold such taxes in our capacity as withholding agent 
in addition  our failure to collect and remit us federal withholding tax may also subject us to penalties

item legal proceedings we sued sassa in the south african high court  or the court  alleging that it unlawfully moved beneficiaries to sapo in violation of our contract and the public finance management act  seeking injunctive relief

sassa has appealed the court s ruling and the parties currently await allocation of a hearing date for the appeal 
additionally  we sued sassa in the court alleging that it unlawfully moved beneficiaries to certain banks  in violation of our contract and the public finance management act  seeking injunctive relief 
on june   the court ruled in our favor and directed sassa to discontinue the registration of any beneficiaries with these banks until a proper procurement process has been completed 
to date  sassa has not appealed the court s ruling 
finally  we have launched a court application for the review and setting aside of the decision to withdraw the most recent sassa tender and we are currently responding to sassa s answering affidavit  where after the parties will apply for a hearing date
