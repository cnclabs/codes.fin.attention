item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
market risk the primary objective of wesbanco s asset liability committee alco is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition  market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions and liquidity risk 
market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
management considers interest rate risk wesbanco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
the relative consistency of wesbanco s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of interest rate risk 
as interest rates change in the market  rates earned on interest rate sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently 
differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities  or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and or the percentage of rate changes 
wesbanco s alco  comprised of senior management from various functional areas  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of an earnings simulation model 
the model is highly dependent on various assumptions  which change regularly as the balance sheet and market interest rates change 
the key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed bi monthly and reviewed and documented by the alco 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effect of changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the earnings simulation model  although it has been subjected to periodic independent reviews and improvements have been made as a result of various third party recommendations  as well as our primary federal regulators during their regular annual exams 
modeling changes in net interest income requires making certain assumptions regarding prepayment rates  callable bonds  and adjustments to non time deposit interest rates which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
prepayment assumptions and adjustments to non time deposit rates at varying levels of interest rates are based primarily on historical experience and current market rates 
security portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments and callable bond forecasts are adjusted at varying levels of interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates  callable bond forecasts and non time deposit rate changes will approximate actual future results 
moreover  the net interest income sensitivity chart presented in table  net interest income sensitivity  assumes the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve  regardless of the duration of the maturity or re pricing of specific assets and liabilities 
since the assumptions used in the model relative to changes in interest rates are uncertain  the simulation analysis should not be relied upon as being indicative of actual results 
the analysis may not consider all actions that wesbanco would employ in response to changes in interest rates and various earning asset and costing liability balances 
management is aware of the significant effect inflation has upon interest rates and ultimately upon financial performance 
wesbanco s ability to cope with inflation is best determined by analyzing its capability to respond to changing market interest rates  as well as its ability to manage the various elements of noninterest income and expense during periods of increasing or decreasing inflation 
wesbanco monitors the level and mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities through alco in order to reduce the impact of inflation on net interest income 
management also controls the effects of inflation by conducting periodic reviews of the prices and terms 
table of contents of its various products and services  both in terms of the costs to offer the services as well as outside market influences upon such pricing  by introducing new products and services or deleting or reducing the availability of existing products and services  and by controlling overhead expenses 
interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming an immediate and sustained and basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates as compared to a stable rate environment or base model 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to a reduction of and or less  respectively  of net interest income from the base model over a twelve month period 
table  net interest income sensitivity  shows wesbanco s interest rate sensitivity at december  and december  assuming both a and basis point interest rate change  compared to a base model  except that due to current low interest rates  the basis point decreasing change is shown as not applicable for and  and instead a basis point rising rate environment is shown 
the policy limit for an increasing basis point rising rate environment is table net interest income sensitivity immediate change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income from base over one year alco guidelines december  december  n a n a n a during the latter part of and throughout  the federal reserve bank provided significant liquidity to the markets due to the recession and also lowered the benchmark federal funds rate charged between banks as well as the discount rate charged to banks  resulting in these rates decreasing from and  respectively  before the rate cuts began in mid to a range of to for federal funds and for the discount rate by late  continuing at these levels for all of central banks worldwide  including the federal reserve bank  have infused liquidity into banks and markets in general with a series of coordinated responses meant to mitigate the impact of the severe recession and overall lack of liquidity for many asset types in the various markets 
a widening of the curve between short and longer term interest rates occurred for much of  and due to wesbanco s prior liability sensitive balance sheet  the bank experienced a widening of its net interest margin throughout much of  as lower overall funding costs more than offset lower loan and investment rates 
in  due to interest rate floors on deposits and other liabilities and other bank and non bank competition as well as the mix of assets and liabilities particular to wesbanco and an increase in non performing loans  asset yields dropped more quickly than funding costs early in the year 
a negative impact to the margin was also caused by the amtrust branch acquisition in march   as reinvestment yields were lower than existing investments and the amount of cash received from the deposit acquisition  exceeding million  could not be fully reinvested until midway through the second quarter  resulting in a significant portion of the proceeds being invested at extremely low overnight rates 
as the investment strategy was completed and management focused on strategies meant to reduce overall funding costs both from the former amtrust branches as well as throughout the bank  the margin improved throughout the second half of the year  although overall it was lower than in as per the table above  the earnings simulation model currently projects that net interest income for the next twelve month period would decrease by if interest rates were to fall immediately by basis points  compared to a decrease of for the same scenario as of december  while a basis point falling interest rate scenario is unrealistic in the present interest rate environment  and is thus not shown above due to the targeted federal funds rate being at an all time low of between to  a decrease of basis points in certain intermediate and longer term sectors of the interest rate curve is possible and is shown above despite the low levels of short term interest rates 

table of contents net interest income would decrease by  and if rates increased by  and  basis points  respectively  as compared to an increase of in a basis point increasing rate environment and decreases of and for the and basis point rising rate environments as of december   with this prior year non linear result caused by an anticipation of slowing prepayment speeds and the extension risk associated with certain asset types  primarily residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities  in a basis point and above rising rate environment 
of note  mortgage instruments  both loans and securities  generally exhibit a propensity to prepay at faster speeds during periods of decreasing rates  and at slower speeds when rates increase  due to the customer s contractual ability to prepay principal without penalty by refinancing particularly when rates are falling  and general unwillingness to give up their current lower interest rate when rates are moving higher 
the increase in liability sensitivity between december  and december  was a result of changes in balance sheet composition primarily as certain borrowings were shortened or matured during  replaced with more overnight borrowings or short term cdars deposits  as well as reductions in certain cd maturities due to customer preferences and the overall lower interest rate environment 
also  an increase in mmdas during the year  partly as a result of maturing cds rolling into this short term product type  increased the bank s liability sensitivity 
the continued reduction in fixed rate  longer term residential mortgages  as the bank sells most of its current fixed rate production into the secondary market  mitigates this liability sensitive position somewhat  but the amtrust branch acquisition reinvestment strategy produced an increase in sensitivity due to the shorter nature of the acquired liabilities than the investments acquired with the net proceeds 
wesbanco s alco expects  absent any other management actions  that its net interest margin will improve through the middle of the year as funding costs continue to reduce  but if short term rates begin to rise later in and into  it is expected the bank may experience some margin compression due to the current higher liability sensitive nature of the balance sheet 
the bank has significant additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of pittsburgh  and may continue  as appropriate  to utilize this funding source to mitigate the impact on our balance sheet of embedded options in commercial and residential loans and to lengthen liabilities to help offset mismatches in various asset maturities 
various derivative strategies may also be employed to reduce the impact of a liability sensitive balance sheet in a rising rate environment  although such strategies would most likely result in a decrease to net interest income and the margin in the short run while permitting some mitigation of a lower margin in the longer term 
as an alternative to the immediate rate shock analysis  the alco monitors interest rate risk by ramping or increasing interest rates basis points gradually over a twelve month period 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period 
management believes that the ramping analysis reflects a more realistic movement of interest rates  whereas the immediate rate shock reflects a less likely scenario 
the simulation model at december   using the basis point increasing rate ramp analysis  projects that net interest income would increase over the next twelve months  compared to a increase at december  wesbanco also periodically measures the economic value of equity  which is defined as the market value of equity in various increasing and decreasing rate scenarios 
at december   the market value of equity as a percent of base in a basis point rising rate environment would decrease  and in a basis point falling rate environment it would decrease  as compared to an increase of and a decrease of  respectively  for the same increasing and decreasing rate environments as of december  wesbanco s policy is to limit such change to minus for a basis point change in interest rates 
wesbanco s alco evaluates various strategies to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
these strategies for most of emphasized reducing funding costs to improve the net interest margin after the branch acquisition 
the alco is currently working to reduce the year end liability sensitive position of the balance sheet by extending borrowings  reducing the size of the investment portfolio with cash flows from sales and maturing or prepaying instruments  increasing longer term cds and cdars deposits and non interest bearing and low cost interest bearing deposits and evaluating certain derivative strategies with the assistance of a third party consulting firm
