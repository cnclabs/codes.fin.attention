mandated increases in the minimum wage continue to place pressure on the company s operating margins in ohio  where more than two thirds of the company s payroll costs are incurred  the minimum wage for non tipped employees was increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was increased to per hour on january  and to per hour on january  there was no increase on january  the minimum wage for tipped employees in ohio increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was increased to per hour on january  and to per hour on january  there was no increase on january  federal minimum wage statutes currently apply to substantially all other non ohio employees 
the federal minimum wage for non tipped employees increased from per hour to per hour in july it was increased to per hour in july and to per hour in july the rate for tipped employees non ohio was not affected by the federal legislation  remaining at per hour 
the effects of paying the required higher hourly rates of pay have been countered through the combination of higher menu prices charged to customers and reductions in the number of scheduled labor hours 
without benefit of further reductions in labor hours  the july federal minimum wage increase to per hour would have increased annual payroll costs in non ohio restaurants by an estimated  at the end of each of the last two fiscal years  the company s equity has been significantly reduced to recognize underfunding in the two defined benefit pension plans that are sponsored by the company

big boy sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators and the sale of big boy s signature brand tartar sauce to grocery stores 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases

in addition  the fourth quarter of fiscal year included a price increase of

another increase is currently being planned for implementation in september the higher menu prices likely contributed to the continuing trend in lower customer traffic 
customer counts in same stores were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year management has no plans to offer competitive discounting or other promotional deals as many other chain restaurant concepts have done during the current economic downturn to boost their sagging customer traffic 
management believes the avoidance of deep discounting has kept the company s sales declines to a minimum  placing it in a solid position of not having to ask customers to give up deals when the economy recovers

percent in june  
percent in march  percent in october  and percent in june the golden corral segment of the business has now experienced a same store sales decline in of the last quarters 
as with big boy  higher menu prices have likely contributed to the continuation of lower customer counts that have been experienced 
same store customer counts were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year the company operated golden corral restaurants as of june   a net increase of one since the beginning of the three year period that began in june the last golden corral restaurant opened by the company occurred in july no golden corral restaurants are currently planned to open over the next twelve months 
the federal health care reform package that was recently signed into law will require the company to post calorie counts and other nutritional information on its menus 
the final rules are expected to be issued by the food and drug administration in march sales volumes in both big boy and golden corral restaurants may be adversely affected if customers significantly alter their dining choices as a result of this information being available to them 
gross profit gross profit for the big boy segment includes wholesale sales and cost of wholesale sales 
gross profit differs from restaurant level profit discussed in note g segment information to the consolidated financial statements  as advertising expense and impairment of asset losses are charged against restaurant level profit 
gross profit for both operating segments is shown below 

table of contents fiscal year fiscal year weeks fiscal year in thousands big boy gross profit golden corral gross profit total gross profit the operating percentages shown in the following table are percentages of total sales  including big boy wholesale sales

fiscal year fiscal year weeks fiscal year total bb gc total bb gc total bb gc sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit combined with the effect of increased menu prices charged to customers  the significant reductions in food and paper cost percentages shown in the above table are the result of food cost deflation that continued throughout much of fiscal year  after first emerging during the second half of fiscal year the declines in wholesale prices followed increases of percent in and percent in  according to the us bureau of labor statistics 
despite the current stable markets for fish and poultry  beef and pork prices have already begun to trend higher and are generally expected to remain elevated throughout the remainder of the calendar year 
purchase contracts for some commodities may contain contractual provisions that limit the price the company will pay 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity prices 
food cost percentages in the golden corral segment are much higher than big boy because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral segment  and because steak is featured daily on the buffet line 
although there is no seasonal fluctuation in employment levels  the number of hours worked by hourly paid employees has always been managed closely according to sales patterns in individual restaurants 
the golden corral segment achieved additional reductions in hours worked  by launching a program in fiscal year that allows customers to help themselves to plates and silverware  which were previously brought to tables by servers 
despite the savings achieved from the reductions in hours and higher menu prices charged to customers  several other factors drove the payroll and related cost percentages above the levels in the comparable year ago period 
in addition to higher levels of incentive compensation  these factors included higher costs associated with benefit programs offered by the company  including significant increases in pension related costs and medical insurance premiums 
certain charges to increase the company s reserves for its self insured workers compensation program also had an adverse effect on the payroll and related percentages 
the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
initial self insurance reserves are accrued based on prior claims history  including an amount developed for incurred but unreported claims 
active management of claims  which includes a requirement for post accident drug testing  keeps the number of claims and the average cost per claim to a minimum 
management 
table of contents performs a comprehensive review each fiscal quarter and adjusts the self insurance reserves as deemed appropriate based on claims experience 
the reserves were increased by  during fiscal year  effected through a charge against earnings 
the reserves were decreased credited to earnings by  and  respectively  in fiscal years and after medical insurance premiums held steady in calendar years and  costs escalated by almost fifteen percent for the plan year that ended december   rising to over  premium cost is currently expected to be percent higher for the plan year that runs january  through december   with costs likely exceeding  the company typically absorbs to percent of the cost  with employees contributing the remainder 
management is currently evaluating health care reform legislation that was recently enacted by the federal government to determine the future effects upon the company 
net periodic pension cost was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the higher cost in fiscal year is primarily the result of market losses in fiscal year that lowered the fair value of plan assets at the end of fiscal year to  from  at the end of fiscal year this loss is amortized through pension cost and it created a lower credit for the expected return on plan assets that flows through pension cost 
the fair value of plan assets rebounded to  at the end of fiscal year the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was percent in fiscal years  and the assumption will be lowered to percent for the determination of pension costs for fiscal year net periodic pension cost will increase by approximately  for each decrease of basis points in the expected return assumption 
the discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions to compute pension costs was percent in fiscal years and  and was percent in fiscal year the rate for fiscal year will be lowered to percent 
net periodic pension cost will increase by approximately  for each decrease of basis points in the discount rate 
the rate of compensation increase used to calculate pension costs was percent in fiscal year and was percent in fiscal years and it will remain at percent for fiscal year net periodic pension cost for fiscal year is currently estimated at approximately  although no contributions have been needed to satisfy minimum legal funding requirements during the last three fiscal years  discretionary contributions made by the company to these plans were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and contributions for fiscal year are currently anticipated to be at least  which includes amounts to meet minimum legal funding requirements to which discretionary contributions have been added 
future funding of the pension plans largely depends upon the performance of investments that are held in trusts that have been established for the plans 
equity securities comprise percent of the target allocation of the plans assets 
the fair value of all plan assets was   and  respectively at the end of fiscal years  and notwithstanding the rebound in fiscal year  the market declines experienced in fiscal year are likely to take several years from which to recover  which will have a material adverse effect upon future funding requirements and result in the recognition of much higher net periodic pension costs for years to come 
pension accounting standards require the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans to be recognized as an asset or liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and projected benefit obligations  which includes a projection of future salary increases 
a  reduction in the company s equity  net of tax  was required to establish the necessary  liability in the company s balance sheet at june  to record underfunded status 
the liability in the company s balance sheet at june  was increased to  as equity was reduced  net of tax 
the reductions in equity were effected through charges to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the underfunding recognized at the end of fiscal year was the direct result of significant declines in the market values of equity securities held by the plans assets 
stronger equity security markets emerged in fiscal year  as interest rates continued to be held to abnormally low levels by the world s central banks 
as a result  the investment gains achieved in fiscal year were not enough to overcome the market declines that were experienced in fiscal year  or to offset the effects of lowering the discount rate used to measure projected benefit obligations as of june  from percent to percent 
the projected benefit obligation increases approximately  for each decrease of basis points in the discount rate 

table of contents the hourly pension plan plan was amended on july  to freeze all future accruals for credited service under the plan after august  the plan had previously been closed to all hourly paid restaurant employees hired after december  the salaried pension plan was amended on july  to close admission to salaried employees hired after june  salaried employees hired before june  continue to participate in the salaried pension plan and receive credit with normal benefits for years of service 
other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  plus costs relating to field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  new restaurant opening costs and many other restaurant operating costs 
as most of these expenses tend to be fixed costs  the percentages shown in the above table are greatly affected by changes in same store sales levels 
in other words  percentages rise when sales decrease and percentages decrease when sales increase 
opening costs can have a significant effect on the percentages 
opening costs for big boy restaurants for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs were zero in each of fiscal years and and were  in fiscal year no opening costs are expected for golden corral in fiscal year other operating costs in fiscal year included a charge of  to write down the carrying value of a big boy restaurant that permanently ceased operations on may  the percentage reductions in golden corral s other operating costs in fiscal year when compared with fiscal year are largely from lower depreciation charges  the result of a million impairment of assets charge that was taken at the end of fiscal year to lower carrying costs of three restaurants 
other operating costs for the golden corral segment are a much higher percentage of sales than big boy because the physical facility of a golden corral restaurant is almost twice as large as a big boy restaurant and golden corral sales volumes have generally remained well below management s original long term expectations for the concept 
operating profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit  administrative and advertising expense is subtracted from gross profit  while franchise fees and other revenue is added to it 
gains and losses from the sale of real property if any are then respectively added or subtracted 
charges for impairment of assets if any are also subtracted from gross profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit 
operating profit in fiscal year included certain amounts discussed below credited to earnings in connection with the settlement of a long standing legal matter 
administrative and advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and advertising expense represents the largest component of these costs 
advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and spending for advertising and marketing programs is proportionate to sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of big boy and golden corral sales on advertising and marketing 
on january   golden corral advertising fees were increased from percent to percent of sales  allowing additional national media buying by golden corral franchising systems  inc  which effectively expanded cable television spots in all the company s market areas 
all other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and the chief executive officer s incentive compensation was included in other administrative costs as follows   and zero respectively was accrued in fiscal years  and stock based compensation costs included in other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and fiscal year included a charge in other administrative costs of  to write off deposits for golden corral development rights 
revenue from franchise fees is based upon sales volumes generated by big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales and are recorded on the accrual method as earned 
as of june   big boy restaurants were licensed to other operators and paying fees to the company 
no new licensed big boy restaurants have opened during any of the periods presented in this md a  one closed during fiscal year and two were closed during fiscal year other revenue also includes certain other fees earned from licensed restaurants along with minimal amounts of rent and investment income 
gains and losses from the sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that routinely arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life 
abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 

table of contents no sales of real property occurred during fiscal year gains from the sale of real property in fiscal year amounted to  on aggregate proceeds of  the totals are primarily attributable to the disposition of a big boy restaurant in the first quarter of fiscal year that had ceased operations in june  the gain from which was  on proceeds of  gains from the sale of real property amounted to  during fiscal year  resulting from the dispositions of three low volume big boy restaurants that had ceased operations respectively in january  april and june during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company received a check for  representing full and final settlement of the arbitration award in the long standing case against the general contractor that had constructed a golden corral restaurant for the company in canton  ohio in  which the company had to subsequently demolish due to defective construction by the contractor 
in addition to the cash received  an additional credit to earnings of  was recorded to reverse a liability that had represented the general contractor s claim against the company for the outstanding contract balance  which was eliminated when the award was made final 
the test for impairment of assets completed at the end of fiscal year determined that the carrying values of three golden corral restaurant locations exceeded expected future cash flows to be generated by the underlying assets 
as a result  a non cash pretax charge of  was recorded to lower the carrying values to fair values 
the total charge reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings includes impairment losses of  for intangible assets associated with unamortized initial franchise fees relating to the three impaired restaurants 
the three impaired restaurants continue to operate 
no significant charges for impairment of assets were recorded during either fiscal year or fiscal year interest expense interest expense was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the decreasing trend is primarily the result of lower debt levels and lower variable interest rates 
however  interest expense will increase in fiscal year because fiscal year was the first year since that the amount borrowed by the company exceeded the amount that was repaid  and borrowing in fiscal year is presently projected to exceed amounts that are scheduled to be repaid 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
the company believes it has no uncertain tax positions that have been filed or that are expected to be taken on a future tax return 
the internal revenue service is currently examining the company s tax return for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources sources of funds food sales to restaurant customers provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds from sales are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in currency or are settled by debit or credit cards 
the primary source of cash provided by operating activities is net earnings plus depreciation and impairment of assets  if any 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against credit lines  proceeds received when stock options are exercised and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion and dividends 
working capital practices the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  which is a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations  and credit lines remain readily available  the use of this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table 

table of contents aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  payments due by period in thousands more than years total year year year year year long term debt interest on long term debt estimated rent due under capital lease obligations rent due under operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations operating leases may include option periods yet to be exercised  when exercise is determined to be reasonably assured 
primarily consists of commitments for certain food and beverage items  plus capital projects including commitments to purchase real property if any 
does not include agreements that are cancellable without penalty 
deferred compensation liability undiscounted 
the working capital deficit was  as of june  the deficit was  as of june  accounts payable for construction costs relating to three new restaurants accounted for most of the increase in the working capital deficit 
there were no costs related to new unit construction included in accounts payable as of june  as of june    remained available to be borrowed under a construction draw credit facility  which is net of  borrowed during fiscal year in addition  a  revolving loan unused at june  is readily available if needed to fund temporary working capital needs 
the company is in compliance with the covenants contained in both of these credit facilities 
the company expects to encounter no difficulties in extending both facilities prior to their scheduled expirations in october operating activities operating cash flows were  in fiscal year  which compares with  in fiscal year and  fiscal year these changes are primarily attributable to normal changes in assets and liabilities such as prepaid expenses  inventories and accounts payable  all of which fluctuate widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
management measures cash flows from the operation of the business by simply adding to net earnings certain non cash expenses such as depreciation  losses net of any gains on dispositions of assets  charges for impairment of long lived assets if any  stock based compensation cost and pension costs in excess of plan contributions 
the result of this approach is shown as a sub total in the consolidated statement of cash flows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year investing activities capital spending is the principal component of the company s investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal year  which included  for big boy restaurants and  for golden corral restaurants 
these capital expenditures consisted of site acquisitions for expansion  new restaurant construction and acquisitions of exiting leased big boy restaurants from landlords  plus on going reinvestments in existing restaurants  which includes remodelings  kitchen and dining room expansions  routine equipment replacements and other maintenance capital expenditures 

table of contents no sales of real property occurred during fiscal year proceeds from the disposition of property during fiscal year amounted to  primarily resulting from the sale of an older big boy restaurant that had ceased operations in june its sale resulted in a gain of  which was reported in the first quarter of fiscal year two former big boy restaurants and five surplus land locations are currently held for sale at an aggregate asking price of financing activities borrowing against credit lines amounted to  during fiscal year  consisting of  borrowed to finance construction and  borrowed specifically to fund the acquisition of five big boy restaurants from the landlord of the facilities see the last paragraph under other information below 
scheduled and other payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  during fiscal year borrowing more than was repaid in a fiscal year had not occurred since borrowing in fiscal year is also expected to exceed scheduled repayments 
regular quarterly cash dividends to shareholders amounted to  
per share in fiscal year a 
per share dividend was declared on june  its payment on july  was the th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the company 
the company expects to continue its year practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends 
during fiscal year   shares of common stock were issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options  which yielded proceeds to the company of approximately  as of june    shares granted under the company s two stock option plans remain outstanding  including  fully vested shares at a weighted average price per share of 
the closing price of the company s stock on june  was 
as of june    shares remained available to be granted under the stock option and incentive plan  which is net of  options granted during fiscal year  options were granted to employees in june  and in october   option shares were granted to the chief executive officer along with  to non employee members of the board of directors 
under a stock repurchase program that expired in january   shares of the company s common stock were acquired over the two year life of the authorization at a cost of approximately  no shares were repurchased from june  through the program s expiration in january on january   the board of directors authorized a new repurchase program under which the company may repurchase up to  shares of its common stock in the open market or through block trades over a two year period that will expire january  from april  when the first repurchase was made through june    shares were acquired at a cost of  so long as it is warranted by the price per share  the company intends to continue making periodic repurchases of its common stock over the remaining two year life of the current authorization 
other information three new big boy restaurants were opened for business in fiscal year in addition  a fourth big boy restaurant was opened during the year  which was the replacement of an older facility 
two big boy restaurant buildings were under construction as of june   scheduled to open respectively in july and august near term construction plans call for two more big boy restaurants to be completed and opened for business before december   with construction of two more likely to begin during the spring of other promising sites are under contract for possible future acquisition and development 
however  these contracts are cancellable at the company s sole discretion while due diligence is pursued under the inspection period provisions of the respective contracts 
including land and land improvements  the cost to build and equip each new big boy restaurant currently ranges from  to  the actual cost depends greatly on the price paid for the land and the cost of land improvements  which can vary widely from location to location  and whether the land is purchased or leased 
costs also depend on whether the new restaurant is constructed using plans for the original building prototype  square feet with seating for guests or its smaller adaptation that was developed in fiscal year  square feet with seating for guests for use in smaller trade areas 
the smaller prototype was used to build two of the four facilities that opened during fiscal year it is also being used to build all four facilities that are scheduled to open in fiscal year approximately one fifth of the big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year 
the renovations not only refresh and upgrade interior finishes  but are also designed to synchronize the interiors and exteriors of older restaurants with that of newly constructed restaurants 
the current average cost to renovate a typical older restaurant ranges from  to  newer prototype restaurants also receive updates when 
table of contents they reach five years of age  the cost of which currently ranges from  to  per restaurant 
the fiscal year remodeling budget for big boy restaurants is  in addition  certain high volume big boy restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies and whether a dining room expansion is warranted 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  and a dining room expansion can cost up to  although the company possesses development rights to open up to twelve more golden corral restaurants through december   no further development is currently planned and there is no active search for sites on which to build 
at the end of fiscal year  management determined that the assets of three golden corral restaurant locations were impaired and a non cash pretax charge of  was recorded to lower the carrying values to fair value 
the impairment charge included  to write off unamortized franchise fees 
the three impaired restaurants remain in operation 
franchise fee deposits totaling  were written off in fiscal year  when the area development agreement with golden corral franchise systems  inc the franchisor was amended to lower the company s development rights to build more golden corral restaurants from to twelve 
nine golden corral restaurants are scheduled to be renovated in fiscal year in addition  carpeting is typically replaced in each restaurant every two and half years on average 
the fiscal year remodeling budget  including carpeting costs  is approximately although part of the company s strategic plan entails owning the land on which it builds new restaurants  it is sometimes necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
during fiscal year  the company entered a capital lease for land on which construction of a big boy restaurant was in progress as of june  under the terms of the lease  the company is required to acquire the land in fee simple estate after the tenth year 
seven of the golden corral restaurants in operation as of june  and three big boy restaurants opened since were built on leased land 
as of june   restaurants were operating on non owned premises  all of which are being accounted for as operating leases 
five big boy restaurant facilities that had been occupied under month to month arrangements were acquired from the landlord in september for total sum of  the purchase prices had been the subject of litigation  which was settled in august in a transaction with a separate landlord  the company exercised its privilege to purchase an existing big boy restaurant facility that had been occupied pursuant to an operating lease 
the transaction was completed in april at a cost of  application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company believes the following to be its critical accounting policies 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  the company reviews claims valued by its third party administrator tpa and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  the company reviews it in light of historical claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement  and any other facts that might provide guidance in determining ultimate value of individual claims 
unexpected changes in any of these or other factors could result in actual costs differing materially from initial projections or values presently carried in the self insurance reserves 

table of contents pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term investment return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
an informal committee comprised of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
to determine the long term rate of return on plan assets  the committee looks at the target asset allocation of plan assets and determines the expected return on each asset class 
the expected returns for each asset class are combined and rounded to the nearest basis points to determine the overall expected return on assets 
the committee determines the discount rate by looking at the projected future benefit payments and matches them to spot rates based on yields of high grade corporate bonds 
a single discount rate is selected  and then rounded to the nearest basis points  which produces the same present value as the various spot rates 
assets of the pension plans are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
poor performance in equity securities markets can significantly lower the market values of the plans investment portfolios  which  in turn  can result in a material increases in future funding requirements  b much higher periodic pension costs to be recognized in future years  and c the plans reaching underfunded status  requiring the company s equity to be reduced 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property and equipment typically approximates to percent of the company s total assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense

future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may influence operating performance  which affect cash flows 
floor values are generally determined by opinions of value provided by real estate brokers and or management s judgment as developed through its experience in disposing of property 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor operating performance 
the ultimate loss can be significantly different from the original impairment charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from initial estimates of floor values
