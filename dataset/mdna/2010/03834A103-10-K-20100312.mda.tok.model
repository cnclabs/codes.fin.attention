the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our results of operations and our financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report and risk factors in item a for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  production and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties 
we focus on natural gas and oil reserves in tight sands and shale and have leasehold interests totaling approximately  gross  net acres as of december  our management team has a proven track record of finding and exploiting unconventional reservoirs through advanced completion  fracturing and drilling techniques 
as the operator all of our production and proved reserves  we have a high degree of control over capital expenditures and other operating matters 
we currently operate or have interests in the following areas west texas ozona northeast wolfcamp  canyon sands  strawn and ellenburger cinco terry wolfcamp  canyon sands and ellenburger east texas north bald prairie cotton valley sand  bossier shale and cotton valley lime northern new mexico el vado east mancos shale southwest kentucky boomerang new albany shale at december   we owned working interests in producing oil and gas wells  had estimated proved reserves of approximately bcfe and were producing mmcfe d  based on production for december our average daily production through february was mmcfe d 
at december   all of our proved reserves and production were located in ozona northeast and cinco terry in west texas and in north bald prairie in east texas 
at year end  our proved reserves were natural gas  proved developed and had a reserve life index of over years  based on production of  mmcfe 
in addition to our producing wells  we had identified  total drilling locations in ozona northeast  cinco terry and north bald prairie at december   of which are proved 
our average realized price for natural gas  oil and ngls before the effect of commodity derivatives transactions decreased  and  respectively  from to as a result  we reduced capital expenditures and drilling activity  paid down long term debt and increased our liquidity by over  from million at december  to million at december  we define liquidity as funds available under our credit facility plus year end cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had million in long term debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility  compared to million at december  another result of reduced drilling activity  plus the natural decline of our tight gas fields  was a decline in our average daily production 
average daily production declined from mmcfe d for the three months ended march   to mmcfe d for the three months ended december  
table of contents we resumed drilling during september and currently are operating two rigs in cinco terry and one rig in ozona northeast 
also in the fourth quarter of  we began acquiring d seismic data across square miles  or  acres  in our cinco terry field 
we completed the acquisition of d seismic data across our cinco terry field in february our d seismic data inventory now covers over  acres in the permian basin 
interpretation of the data is expected to be complete by june we realize higher oil and ngl volumes in cinco terry than in ozona northeast where we have a sales contract that does not include processing of ngls or north bald prairie where substantially all of our production is dry gas 
therefore  as we have continued to develop cinco terry  we have increased the oil and ngl component of our overall production and reserves 
in addition  our contract in ozona northeast expires in the first quarter of  after which time we expect to begin processing ngls in ozona northeast 
excluding the effect of any future acquisitions  we expect that further development of cinco terry in and beyond  along with processing gas in ozona northeast in and beyond  will continue to increase the oil and ngl component of our production and reserve in the future 
segment reporting is not applicable to us as we have a single  company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments 
we track only basic operational data by area 
we do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area 
we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and gas 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demand  which is impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  estimates of inventory storage levels  gas price differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and liquidity that may be accessed through our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and through capital markets 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
future finding and development costs are subject to changes in the industry  including the costs of acquiring  drilling and completing our projects 
we focus our efforts on increasing oil and gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
our future cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to manage our overall cost structure 
like all oil and gas production companies  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
oil and gas production from a given well naturally decreases over time 
additionally  our reserves have a rapid initial decline 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to develop and identify additional reserves  farm ins or other joint drilling ventures  and by acquisitions 
however  during times of severe price declines  we may from time to time reduce current capital expenditures and curtail drilling operations in order to preserve liquidity 
a material reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities could materially reduce our production volumes and revenues from pre levels and increase future expected costs necessary to develop existing reserves 
as discussed above  due to the extended decline of oil and natural gas prices  we released our remaining rigs during the first week of april the natural decline of our tight gas fields and reduced drilling activity has caused a decline in our average daily production since the three months ended march  we also face the challenge of financing future acquisitions 
we believe we have adequate unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for possible acquisitions  temporary working capital needs and any expansion of our drilling program 
funding for future acquisitions also may require additional sources of financing  which may not be available 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under gaap 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas activities successful efforts accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
the significant principles for this method are geological and geophysical evaluation costs are expensed as incurred  dry holes for exploratory wells are expensed  and dry holes for developmental wells are capitalized  and capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  including wells and related equipment and facilities  are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net capitalized costs related to proved properties  then we recognize an impairment charge in income from operations equal to the difference between the net capitalized costs related to proved properties and their estimated fair values based on the present value of the related future net cash flows 
we noted no impairment of our proved properties based on our analysis for the years ended december   or proved reserves on december   the sec released a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  approving revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
the new reserve rules are effective for our financial statements for the year ended december  and our year end proved reserve estimates 
the most significant revisions to the reporting requirements include commodity prices 
economic producibility of reserves is now based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of the month for the month period prior to fiscal year end  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped for undrilled areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a producing well if there is reasonable certainty that the quantities will be recovered  reliable technology 
the rules now permit the use of new technologies to establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes  unproved reserves 
probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis  preparation of reserves estimates 
disclosure is required regarding the internal controls used to assure objectivity in the reserves estimation process and the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing reserves estimates  and third party reports 
we are now required to file the report of any third party used to prepare or audit reserves our estimates 

table of contents in addition  in january  fasb issued account standards update  or the update   oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  to provide consistency with the new reserve rules 
the update amends existing standards to align the reserves calculation and disclosure requirements under gaap with the requirements in the sec s reserve rules 
we adopted the new standards effective december  the new standards are applied prospectively as a change in estimate 
for the year ended december   we engaged degolyer and macnaughton  independent petroleum engineers  to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves associated with certain of our oil and gas properties in accordance with guidelines established by the sec  including the recent revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
we adopted these revisions effective december  estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december  for natural gas  oil and ngls in accordance with new reserve rules 
the new reserve rules resulted in the use of lower prices for natural gas  oil and ngls than would have resulted under the previous reporting requirements 
under the new reserve rules  our estimated proved reserves increased by  mmcfe 
under the previous reserve rules  our estimated total proved reserves of natural gas  oil and ngls would have increased by  mmcfe 
therefore  the effect of the new reserve rules was a negative revision of  mmcfe 
changes in commodity prices and operation costs may also affect the overall evaluation of reservoirs 
a hypothetical decline in our december  estimated proved reserves would have increased our depletion expense by approximately  for the year ended december  under previous reserve rules year end spot prices for natural gas  oil and ngls  our depletion expense would have decreased by approximately  see also items and business and properties proved oil and gas reserves and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves 
derivative instruments and commodity derivative activities unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
changes in the derivative s fair value are currently recognized in the statement of operations unless specific commodity derivative hedge accounting criteria are met and such strategies are designated 
for 
table of contents qualifying cash flow commodity derivatives  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income to the extent the commodity derivative is effective 
the ineffective portion of the commodity derivative is recognized immediately in the statement of operations 
gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income are reclassified to oil and gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for commodity derivative accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current income or expense in the statement of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled unrealized loss gain on commodity derivatives 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
accordingly  we record realized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized an unrealized loss of million and million  respectively  from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized gain of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
share based compensation our stock incentive plan allows grants of stock and options to employees and outside directors 
granting of awards may increase our general and administrative expenses subject to the size and timing of the grants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we measure and record compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and outside directors based on estimated grant date fair values 
compensation costs for awards granted are recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of each option granted was estimated using an option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions during the years ended december  and there were no stock option grants during the year ended december  
table of contents expected dividends expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years years we have not paid out dividends historically  thus the dividend yields are estimated at zero percent 
since our shares were not publicly traded prior to our initial public offering on november   we used an average of historical volatility rates based upon other companies within our industry 
management believes that these average historical volatility rates are currently the best available indicator of expected volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term of five years 
the expected lives of our options are determined based on the term of the option using the simplified method outlined in staff accounting bulletin assumptions are reviewed each time there is a new grant and may be impacted by actual fluctuation in our stock price  movements in market interest rates and option terms 
the use of different assumptions produces a different fair value for the options granted or modified and impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued amendments to fair value measurements and disclosures under asc effective for the year ended december   this guidance provides for disclosures of significant transfers in an out of levels and in addition  the guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding inputs and valuation techniques as well as the appropriate level of disaggregation for fair value measurements and disclosures 
effective for the year ending december   this guidance provides for disclosures of activity on a gross basis within level reconciliation 
we do not expect this standard to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the cost of labor or supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher prices 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth summary information regarding natural gas  oil and ngl revenues  production  average product prices and average production costs and expenses for the last two years

oil and gas production 
production for the year ended december  totaled bcfe mmcfe d  compared to bcfe mmcfe d produced in the prior year 
production for the year ended december  was natural gas and oil and ngls  compared to natural gas and oil and ngls in prior year period 
we expect production to increase slightly in oil and gas sales 
oil and gas sales decreased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in oil and gas sales principally resulted from sharp decreases in the price we received for our natural gas  oil and ngl production 
the average price we received for our production  before the effect of commodity derivatives  decreased from per mcfe to per mcfe  or a decrease 
of the million decrease in revenues  approximately million was attributable to a decrease in oil and gas prices  partially offset by million in revenues attributable to a slight increase in production volumes over the prior year 

table of contents commodity derivative activities 
realized losses and gains from our commodity derivative activity increased our earnings by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
realized gains and losses are derived from the relative movement of gas prices in relation to the range of prices in our collars or the fixed notional pricing for the respective years 
the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was million for and the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives was million for as natural gas commodity prices increase  the fair value of the open portion of those positions decreases 
the unrealized loss for primarily resulted from the settlement of derivative contracts which were outstanding at december  as natural gas commodity prices decrease  the fair value of the open portion of those positions increases 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled unrealized loss gain on commodity derivatives 
lease operating expense 
our lease operating expenses  or loe  increased  or  for the year ended december  to million per mcfe from million per mcfe for the year ended december  increases in ad valorem taxes and pumpers and supervision costs were partially offset by decreases in well repair and maintenance and workover costs 
on a per mcfe basis  we expect loe to remain relatively constant in following is a summary of lease operating expenses per mcfe change change compressor rental and repair pumpers and supervision ad valorem taxes well repair and maintenance water hauling  insurance and other workovers total severance and production taxes 
our production taxes decreased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in production taxes was a function of the decrease in oil and gas sales between and severance and production taxes amounted to approximately and of oil and gas sales for december  and  respectively 
we expect severance and production taxes to be between and of revenues during exploration 
we recorded million of exploration expense for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  exploration expense in the period resulted primarily from d seismic acquired across our cinco terry field and the expiration of leases in our ozona northeast and north bald prairie fields 
exploration expense for the period resulted from one dry hole drilled in ozona northeast and  of lease extensions in ozona northeast 
due to additional d expenses from the seismic acquisition across cinco terry  lease renewals and expirations  and potential exploration costs in northern new mexico  we expect exploration expense to increase in impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved and unproved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting 
as a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets  we recorded an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties of million and million in and  respectively 
the impairment resulted from a write off of million in acreage costs in northeast british columbia  and represents the remaining carrying value we have recorded for the project 
the impairment resulted from a write off of million of drilling costs incurred for three test wells in our boomerang project and related to the drilling and completion of three wells in our northeast british columbia project 

table of contents general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased million  or  to million per mcfe for the year ended december  from million per mcfe for the year ended december  our g a for included higher share based compensation  as well as higher salaries  related employee benefit costs attributable to an increase in staff from the prior year period and a severance payment to a former officer 
our g a for the year ended december   also included an increase in franchise taxes

interest expense  net 
our interest expense increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was substantially the result of our higher average debt level during income taxes 
our provision for income taxes decreased to a benefit of  for the year ended december   compared with expense of million for the year ended december  our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective rate resulted primarily from a change in our estimated income tax expenses for the year ended december   along with an increased impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income and increased effective state income tax rates

oil and gas production 
production for the year ended december  totaled bcfe mmcfe d  compared to bcfe mmcfe d produced in the prior year  an increase of 
production for the year ended december  was natural gas and oil and ngls  compared to natural gas and oil and ngls in prior year period 
oil and gas sales 
oil and gas sales increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in oil and gas sales principally resulted from our increased ownership in the ozona northeast field as a result of our acquisition of the neo canyon interest in the fourth quarter of and increased revenue from our cinco terry and north bald prairie fields 
we now own substantially all working interests in ozona northeast 
of the  mmcfe of production reported for  approximately  mmcfe was attributable to the interest acquired from neo canyon 
the increase in oil and gas sales also resulted from continued development of our cinco terry and north bald prairie fields 
cinco terry production increased by  mmcfe compared to the prior year 
production from north bald prairie accounted for mmcfe in 
table of contents production for further  the average price per mcfe we received for our production increased from to per mcfe as average oil and gas prices increased significantly between the two years 
of the million increase in revenues  million was attributable to growth in volume with the remaining million due to oil and gas price increases 
natural gas sales represented of the total oil and gas sales in compared to in  as our cinco terry field has a larger component of oil and ngls in its production 
commodity derivative activities 
realized losses and gains from our commodity derivative activity increased our earnings by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
realized gains and losses are derived from the relative movement of gas prices in relation to the range of prices in our collars or the fixed notional pricing for the respective years 
the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives was million for and the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was million for as natural gas commodity prices increase  the fair value of the open portion of those positions decreases 
as natural gas commodity prices decrease  the fair value of the open portion of those positions increases 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled unrealized loss gain on commodity derivatives 
lease operating expense 
our loe increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million per mcfe from million per mcfe for the year ended december  the increase in loe over the prior year was primarily a result of the acquisition of the neo canyon working interest and strawn ellenburger deep rights in ozona northeast 
the increase in was also attributable to initial startup costs  including compression and treating costs in cinco terry and north bald prairie  as well as a rise in repair and maintenance costs in ozona northeast 
following is a summary of lease operating expenses per mcfe change change compressor rental and repair pumpers and supervision ad valorem taxes repairs and maintenance water hauling  insurance and other workovers total severance and production taxes 
our production taxes increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in production taxes was a function of the increase in oil and gas sales between the two periods 
severance and productions taxes amounted to approximately and of oil and gas sales for the respective years 
the increase in the severance and production taxes as a percentage of oil and gas sales is due to higher severance tax rates for ngl revenues from cinco terry and higher estimated taxes after abatements for newer wells in ozona northeast and cinco terry 
exploration 
we recorded million of exploration expense for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  exploration expense for the period resulted from one dry hole drilled in ozona northeast and  of lease extensions in ozona northeast 
we incur these costs to maintain our leasehold positions and accordingly  we expense them as incurred 
exploration expense for the period resulted from the drilling of two dry holes in our boomerang project and cinco terry project

interest expense  net 
our interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was substantially the result of our lower average debt level and lower interest rates in additionally  interest expense for the year ended december  included million related to the beneficial conversion feature of our convertible notes and  relating to accrued interest on the convertible notes 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december   from a benefit of  for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense was due to the increase in our income before income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared with a benefit of for the year ended december  the tax benefit for the year ended december  related to the release of a valuation allowance on net operating loss carryovers generated by aog before the combination of aog and approach under the contribution agreement on november  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generally will rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and  to the extent that credit and capital market conditions will allow  future public equity and debt offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions depends upon our future operating performance  availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which is affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot predict whether additional liquidity from equity or debt financings beyond our revolving credit facility will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  in the foreseeable future 
our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices and production volumes and the effect of commodity derivatives 
prices for oil and gas are affected by national and international economic and political environments  national and global supply and demand for hydrocarbons  seasonal influences of weather and other factors beyond our control 
our working capital is significantly influenced by changes in commodity prices  and significant declines in prices will cause a decrease in our production volumes and exploration and development expenditures 
our working capital also is influenced by our efforts to lower our long term debt and related interest costs 
cash flows from operations are primarily used to fund exploration and development of our oil and gas properties 
we intend to fund capital expenditures  excluding any acquisitions  primarily out of internally generated cash flows and  as necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million available to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
for the year ended december   our primary sources of cash were from operating activities 
approximately million of cash from operations was used to fund our drilling program and d seismic operations and pay down our long term debt 
for the year ended december   our primary sources of cash were from financing and operating activities 
approximately million from borrowings net of payments under our revolving credit facility and million cash from operations were used to fund our drilling program and the acquisition of a working interest below the top of the strawn formation and rights to miles of gathering system in the ozona northeast field 
our primary sources of cash in were from financing and operating activities

table of contents our current goal is to manage our borrowings to help us maintain financial flexibility and liquidity  and to avoid the problems associated with highly leveraged companies with large interest costs and possible debt reductions restricting ongoing operations 
we believe that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will finance substantially all of our capital needs through we may also use our revolving credit facility for possible acquisitions and temporary working capital needs 
further  we may determine to access the public equity or debt markets for potential acquisitions  working capital or other liquidity needs  if such financing is available on acceptable terms 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registering up to million of common stock  debt and other securities 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on february  capital expenditures the following table summarizes our estimated capital expenditures for we intend to fund capital expenditures  excluding any acquisitions  primarily out of internally generated cash flows and  as necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
year ending december  in thousands west texas ozona northeast cinco terry exploratory lease acquisition  geological and geophysical total capital expenditures our capital expenditure budget for is subject to change depending upon a number of factors  including economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas  the results of our development and exploration efforts  the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects  our financial results  the availability of leases on reasonable terms and our ability to obtain permits for the drilling locations 
we expect drilling rigs  drilling crews  steel tubulars and oilfield services to be in high demand in the permian basin during  and that the costs related to these services will increase from levels 
revolving credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility with a borrowing base set at million 
the borrowing base is redetermined semi annually on or before each april and october based on our oil and gas reserves 
we or the lenders can each request one additional borrowing base redetermination each calendar year 
currently  the maturity date under our revolving credit facility is july  borrowings bear interest based on the agent bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to  or the sum of the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
margins vary based on the borrowings outstanding compared to the borrowing base 
in addition  we pay an annual commitment of of non used borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
we had outstanding borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility at december  the weighted average interest rate applicable to our outstanding borrowings was at december  we also had outstanding unused letters of credit under our revolving credit facility totaling  at december   which reduce amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents loans under our revolving credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our west texas assets and are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
at february   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  with a weighted average interest rate of covenants our credit agreement contains two principal financial covenants a consolidated modified current ratio covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of not less than to at all times 
the consolidated modified current ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated current assets as defined in the credit agreement by consolidated current liabilities as defined in the credit agreement 
as defined more specifically in the credit agreement  the consolidated modified current ratio is calculated as current assets less current unrealized gains on commodity derivatives plus the available borrowing base at the respective balance sheet date  divided by current liabilities less current unrealized losses on commodity derivatives at the respective balance sheet date 
a consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitdax ratio covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of not more than to at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitdax ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated funded debt as defined in the credit agreement by consolidated ebitdax as defined in the credit agreement 
as defined more specifically in the credit agreement  consolidated ebitdax is calculated as net income loss  plus exploration expense  depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  share based compensation expense  unrealized loss on commodity derivatives  interest expense  income and franchise taxes and certain other non cash expenses  less gains or losses from sales or dispositions of assets  unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and extraordinary or non recurring gains 
for purposes of calculating this ratio  consolidated ebitdax for a fiscal quarter is annualized pursuant to the credit agreement 
our credit agreement also restricts cash dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of other debt  consolidations and mergers  the level of operating leases  assets sales  investments in other entities and liens on properties 
in addition  our credit agreement contains customary events of default that would permit our lenders to accelerate the debt under our credit agreement if not cured within applicable grace periods  including  among others  failure to make payments of principal or interest when due  materially incorrect representations and warranties  failure to make mandatory prepayments in the event of borrowing base deficiencies  breach of covenants  defaults upon other obligations in excess of  events of bankruptcy  the occurrence of one or more unstayed judgments in excess of  not covered by an acceptable policy of insurance  failure to pay any obligation in excess of  owed under any derivatives transaction or in any amount if the obligation under the derivatives transaction is secured by collateral under the credit agreement  any event of default by the company occurs under any agreement entered into in connection with a derivatives transaction  liens securing the loans under the credit agreement cease to be in place  a change in control as more specifically defined in the credit agreement of the company occurs  and dissolution of the company 
at december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants and had not committed any acts of default under the credit agreement 
to date we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access our revolving credit facility 
however  our lenders have substantial ability to reduce our borrowing base on the basis of subjective factors  including the loan collateral value that each lender  in its discretion and using the methodology  assumptions and discount rates as such lender customarily uses in evaluating oil and gas properties  assigns to our properties 

table of contents contractual commitments our contractual commitments consist of long term debt  accrued interest on long term debt  daywork drilling contracts  operating lease obligations  asset retirement obligations and employment agreements with executive officers 
our long term debt is composed of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings based on the agent bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to  or the sum of the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
margins vary based on the borrowings outstanding compared to the borrowing base 
in addition  we pay an annual commitment of of non used borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit facility and note for a discussion of our revolving credit facility 
we periodically enter into contractual arrangements under which we are committed to expend funds to drill wells in the future  including agreements to secure drilling rig services  which require us to make future minimum payments to the rig operators 
we record drilling commitments in the periods in which well capital expenditures are incurred or rig services are provided 
our commitment under the drilling contracts is million at december  in april  we signed a five year lease for approximately  square feet of office space in fort worth  texas 
in august  we expanded our office space under an amendment to the lease to approximately  square feet 
in january  we began rent payments of approximately  per month  including common area expenses 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
we have outstanding employment agreements with two of our executive officers that contain automatic renewal provisions providing that such agreements may be automatically renewed for successive terms of one year unless employment is terminated at the end of the term by written notice given to the employee not less than days prior to the end of such term 
our maximum commitment under the employment agreements  which would apply if the employees covered by these agreements were all terminated without cause  was approximately  at december  
table of contents the following table summarizes these commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt daywork drilling contracts operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations employment agreements with executive officers total see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revolving credit facility 
interest payments have been calculated by applying the interest rate of at december   to the outstanding long term debt of million at december  daywork drilling contracts related to three drilling rigs contracted through february  operating lease obligations are for office space and equipment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our asset retirement obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices  and other related factors 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for commodity derivative and investment purposes  not for trading purposes 
proved reserves estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december  for natural gas  oil and ngls  in accordance with new reserve rules 

table of contents changes in commodity prices and operation costs may also affect the overall evaluation of reservoirs 
a hypothetical decline in our december  estimated proved reserves would have increased our depletion expense by approximately  for the year ended december  under previous reserve rules year end spot prices for natural gas  oil and ngls  our depletion expense would have decreased by approximately  commodity price risk given the current economic outlook  we expect commodity prices to remain volatile 
even modest decreases in commodity prices can materially affect our revenues and cash flow 
in addition  if commodity prices remain suppressed for a significant amount of time  we could be required under successful efforts accounting rules to perform a write down of our oil and gas properties 
we enter into financial swaps and collars to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
we do not designate such instruments as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we record open commodity derivative positions on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and recognize changes in such fair values as income expense on our consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
at december   we have the following commodity derivative positions outstanding volume mmbtu mmbtu period monthly total fixed nymex henry hub price swaps price swaps price swaps waha basis differential basis swaps basis swaps at december  and december   the fair value of our open derivative contracts was a net liability of approximately million and an asset of million  respectively 
jpmorgan chase bank  national association and keybank national association are currently the only counterparties to our commodity derivatives positions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
jpmorgan is the administrative agent and a participant  and keybank is a participant  in our revolving credit facility and the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility is used as collateral for our commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized an unrealized loss of million and million  respectively  from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized gain of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was primarily attributable to the settlement of derivative contracts 
a hypothetical increase in the 
table of contents nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
to estimate the fair value of our commodity derivatives positions  we use market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use the best available information 
we determine the fair value based upon the hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
at december   we had no level measurements 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
our derivatives  which consist primarily of commodity swaps and collars  are valued using commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs and quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves 
where observable inputs are available  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  the instrument is categorized in level at december   all of our commodity derivatives were valued using level measurements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value 
at december   our level measurements were used to calculate our asset retirement obligation and our impairment analysis of proved properties at december
