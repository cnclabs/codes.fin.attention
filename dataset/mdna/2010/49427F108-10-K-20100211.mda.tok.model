item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
market risk as of december   approximately of our total outstanding debt of billion was subject to variable interest rates 
the remaining bore interest at fixed rates 
all of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes 
in general  interest rate fluctuations applied to our variable rate debt will impact our future earnings and cash flows 
conversely  interest rate fluctuations applied to our fixed rate debt will generally not impact our future earnings and cash flows  unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated and need to be refinanced 
however  interest rate fluctuations will impact the fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments 
with the exception of the exchangeable notes  we generally determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market rate 
we calculate the market rate by obtaining period end treasury rates for maturities that correspond to the maturities of our fixed rate debt and then adding an appropriate credit spread based on information obtained from third party financial institutions 
these credit spreads take into account factors  including but not limited to  our credit standing  the maturity of the debt  whether the debt is secured or unsecured  and the loan to value ratio of the debt 
we determine the fair value of the liability component of our exchangeable notes by performing discounted cash flow analysis using an appropriate market interest rate for similar non convertible conventional debt instruments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the fair value of our financial instruments as of december  and the total outstanding balance of our variable rate debt  which includes our credit facility and one secured line of credit  was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are indexed to libor plus spreads of to weighted average interest rate was and as of december  and  respectively 
assuming no changes in the outstanding balance of our existing variable rate debt as of december   a basis point increase in the libor rate would increase our projected annual interest expense  before the effect of capitalization  by approximately million 
comparatively  if interest rates were basis points higher as of december   our projected annual interest expense  before the effect of capitalization  would have been million higher 
our total variable rate debt is currently scheduled to mature in april our credit facility  which had a principal balance of million as of december   has a one year extension option 
we have notified the lenders that we intend to exercise this option and extend the maturity of the credit facility through april for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the total carrying value of our fixed rate debt  including our exchangeable notes  was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the total estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point increase in the discount rate equates to a decrease in the total fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million  or  as of december  comparatively  a basis point increase in the discount rate equates to a decrease in the total fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million  or  as of december  
table of contents the above sensitivity analyses do not consider interrelationships between different market movements  which could result in additional changes in the fair value of our debt and exchangeable notes  beyond the amounts calculated
