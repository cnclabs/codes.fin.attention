overview virtualscopics  inc is a leading provider of imaging solutions to accelerate drug and medical device development 
we have developed a robust software platform for analysis and modeling of both structural and functional medical images 
in combination with our industry leading experience and expertise in advanced imaging biomarker measurement  this platform provides a uniquely clear window into the biological activity of drugs and devices in clinical trial patients  allowing our customers to make better decisions faster 
in july  virtualscopics was formed after being spun out of the university of rochester 
in june  we purchased the underlying technology and patents created by virtualscopics founders from the university of rochester 
in november  we performed an exchange transaction with consultamerica whereby prior to the exchange consultamerica  inc had no meaningful operations and  therefore  the exchange was treated as recapitalization of virtualscopics  llc 
following the transaction  we succeeded to the business of virtualscopics  inc as a provider of image based biomarker solutions and have continued this business since that time 
we own all rights to the patents underlying its technology 
revenue over the past eight years has been derived primarily from image processing services in connection with pharmaceutical drug trials 
for these services  we have been concentrating in the areas of oncology and osteoarthritis 
we have also derived a small portion of revenue from consulting services  and pharmaceutical drug trials in the neurology and cardiovascular areas 
we expect that the concentration of our revenue will continue in these services and in those areas in revenues are recognized as the mri and ct images that we process are quantified and delivered to our customers and or the services are performed 
during  we will also continue to pursue the personalized medicine market  however  we do not anticipate significant revenues from this market opportunity in as we further define our opportunity and commercialization strategy 
as of december   the amount remaining to be earned from active projects and awards was approximately million 
once we enter into a new contract for participation in a drug trial  there are several factors that can effect whether we will realize the full benefits under the contract  and the time over which we will realize that revenue 
customers may not continue our services due to performance reasons with their compounds in development 
furthermore  the contracts may contemplate performance over multiple years 
therefore  revenue may not be realized in the fiscal year in which the contract is signed or the award is made 
recognition of revenue under the contract may also be affected by the timing of patient recruitment and image site identification and training 
additionally  the majority of contracts we have with customers are cancelable for any reason by giving days advance notice 
results of operations results of operations for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we had revenues of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   representing a increase 
the increase in revenues is directly related to the growing demand for our services in the industry 
we continue to see growing demand for our oncology analysis services as well as demand within the medical device industry 
during we performed work for customers  representing different projects  in connection with their pharmaceutical drug trials primarily in the fields of oncology and musculoskeletal diseases osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis along with various other projects 
this compares to projects in our average contract size was  in compared to approximately  in the increase in contract size is a reflection of a greater number of studies performed in later phases of clinical trials as well as our customers confidence and value in our services 
as of december   we had active projects with of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the world 
historically  the majority of the pharmaceutical projects for which we have performed work to date are in pre clinical  phase i or phase ii studies 
in  of our revenues were now from phase ii and phase iii studies compared to for the full year of additionally  for the year ended december   oncology  musculoskeletal and other projects represented   and  respectively  of our revenues 
this compares to   and  respectively  for gross profit we had a gross profit of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in our gross profit improved year over year due to the greater amount of work performed on later stage clinical trials  and efficiencies made within our operations 
later stage trials phase ii iii typically have more analysis due to the patient population of the study  as a result  we tend to have greater economies of scale because of the repetitive nature of the work we perform 
we anticipate our gross margins will approximate throughout based on the projected nature of the project services in later stage trials we expect to perform 
research and development research and development costs increased slightly in by  or  to  when compared to the slight increase was largely attributed to the allocation of resources to research and development during  along with the relocation costs associated with one of our scientists 
as of december   there were ten employees in our research and development group  this includes the algorithm and software development groups 
our research and development efforts are centered around improving the functionality of our existing algorithms and software platform as well as the refinement of our algorithms to new therapeutic areas 
we anticipate some investments made within our software platform in as we enhance and enable a reporting functionality accessible to our customers 
sales and marketing sales and marketing costs increased slightly in by  to  when compared to the increase was a result of higher marketing efforts during the first half of  offset by higher commissions and salaries in we anticipate additional investments in our sales and marketing effort in as we continue to increase our efforts around broader market penetration of our services 
as of the date of this report  there are five individuals in our sales and marketing department 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  representing a slight increase of  or  when compared to the increase is mainly due to higher costs associated with computer network and licensing costs supporting the increase in revenues during during  the company anticipates higher general and administrative costs as it continues its investment in the commercialization of the personalized medicine application 
the company anticipates consultant charges to add to the base of general and administrative costs that it currently operates within 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization charges increased slightly for the year ended december  by  or less than  to  when compared to this increase is attributed to the amortization and depreciation of patents and computer equipment 
the amortization and depreciation schedules are based on the timing and life of the patent costs and equipment 
we continue to invest in our patent portfolio and computer systems  however  do not anticipate significant expenditures necessary in either area to support our current business 
interest expense income  net interest income for the year ended december  was  representing interest derived on the company s operating and savings accounts  compared to interest income of  in the decrease in interest income was due to lower rates of return earned on our investment accounts 
other expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively which relates to franchise taxes paid during the year 
additionally  we recognized a marked to market adjustment of  related to the loss in fair value of warrants issued during our and equity raises 
no adjustment was required in in accordance with asc net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the decrease in our net loss over the prior period was related to higher revenues  better gross margin and reduced spending in research and development  as planned and outlined above offset by a non cash marked to market adjustment to reflect the changes in the fair value of certain outstanding warrants during as compared to liquidity and capital resources our working capital as of december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital was a result of the  non cash mark to market adjustment with respect to warrants issued in our and equity financings  required under asc for retroactive adjustment was not required for under the guidance of asc this was offset by a  increase in our cash balance compared to december  net cash provided by operating activities in was  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  in this significant improvement in the amount of cash used on operating activities was primarily the result of the strong revenue growth and solid cost controls in also impacting the change from the prior year was the timing of payment of our receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses and advance billings from customers  which is reflected in deferred revenue 
as we perform the services to our customers  revenue is recognized and offset against deferred revenue 
we invested  in the purchase of equipment and the acquisition of patents in  compared to  for the investment of these items in this increase largely represents an increase in computer hardware and software to support our growing revenues and hiring of employees 
we anticipate that our it related costs will increase in as we develop our on line reporting tool for our customers 
during  we incurred  in patent costs associated with filing costs for intellectual property  as compared to  in the reduction is due to the timing of office actions within our existing patent filings 
net cash used in financing activities in was  compared to net cash provided by our financing activities in was  this decrease was due to restricted cash which was used in for the payment of dividends 
we currently expect that existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our existing operations for the next months and foreseeable future 
if in the future our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we need to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise sufficient funds on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail our level of expenditures and our rate of expansion 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than the consulting agreements and operating leases as described in contractual obligations below that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect that is material to investors on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources or capital expenditures
