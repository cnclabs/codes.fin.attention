item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the liquidity section of this report 
competitive conditions we experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve  principally with respect to product performance and price  from various competitors  many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources 
success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation  customer support  responsiveness  and cost management 
we continue to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets 
government contracts all us government contracts  including subcontracts where the us government is the ultimate customer  may be subject to termination at the election of the government 
since the january  acquisition of dme  our revenue stream relies more on military spending as a significant portion of dme s revenue is derived from military applications 
raw materials materials  supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources 
we believe that the loss of any one source  although potentially disruptive in the short term  would not materially affect our operations in the long term 
seasonality our business is typically not seasonal 
backlog at december   our backlog was approximately million 
at december   our backlog was approximately million 
backlog in the aerospace segment was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
approximately million of the december  backlog is expected to be realized in backlog in the test systems segment was approximately million at december  of which approximately million is expected to be realized in patents we have a number of patents 
while the aggregate protection of these patents is of value  our only material business that is dependent upon the protection afforded by these patents is our cabin power distribution product 
our patents and patent applications relate to electroluminescence  instrument panels  keyboard technology and a broad patent covering the cabin power distribution technology 
we regard our expertise and techniques as proprietary and rely upon trade secret laws and contractual arrangements to protect our rights 
we have trademark protection in major markets 

table of contents research  development and engineering activities we are engaged in a variety of engineering and design activities as well as basic research and development activities directed to the substantial improvement or new application of our existing technologies 
these costs are expensed when incurred and included in cost of sales 
research and development and engineering costs amounted to approximately million in  million in and million in employees we employed  employees as of december  we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
stock distribution on september   we announced a one for four distribution of class b stock to holders of both common and class b stock 
on or about october   stockholders received one share of class b stock for every four shares of common and class b stock held on the record date of october  all share quantities  share prices and per share data reported throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this distribution

item a 
risk factors the current capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to capital  cost of capital and business operations 
in  the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital 
if these conditions continue or become worse  our future cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets could be adversely affected 
any inability to obtain adequate financing from debt and equity sources could force us to self fund strategic initiatives or even forgo some opportunities  potentially harming our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the amount of debt we have outstanding  as well as any debt we may incur in the future  could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  of which million is long term debt 
changes to our level of debt subsequent to december  could have significant consequences to our business  including the following depending on interest rates and debt maturities  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy  capital expenditures or other purposes  a significant amount of debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates  our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired  the increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios  and 
table of contents we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors  which may result in a competitive disadvantage 
we are subject to debt covenant restrictions 
our credit facility contains several financial and other restrictive covenants 
a significant decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our maximum leverage ratio  fixed charge ratio or minimum net worth ratio 
this could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness 
our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long term assets 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long term assets in the financial statements 
these estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss 
actual future results could differ from those estimates 
a write off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results  net worth and cause us to violate covenants in our bank credit facility 
at december   goodwill and purchased intangible assets were approximately and approximately of our total assets respectively 
our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions 
we may have to write off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired 
although this write off would be a non cash charge  it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly 
a write off of goodwill or other intangible assets could also cause us to violate covenants in our bank credit facility that requires a minimum level of net worth 
this could result in our inability to borrow under our bank credit facility or obligate us to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness 
the markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
in our aerospace segment  demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors  including capital investment  product innovations  economic growth and wealth creation  and technology upgrades 
in addition  the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases  labor disputes  global economic conditions  availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand 
a change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft 
these factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products  thus reducing our sales and profits 
a reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all 
we are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future such as the boeing  f joint strike fighter and lear as with any new program there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market 
as is customary for our business we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer 
if a program or aircraft is not successful we may have to write off all or a part of the inventory  accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program 
a write off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements 
this could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bond debt 
in our test systems segment  demand for our products is dependent upon several factors  including government funding levels for our products  our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers 
a change in any of these factors could result in a reduction of our sales and profits 
our products are sold in highly competitive markets 
some of our competitors are larger  more diversified corporations and have greater financial  marketing  production and research and development 
table of contents resources 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors develop products that are superior to our products  develop products that are more competitively priced than our products  develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality  price  design and engineering capabilities  product development  conformity to customer specifications  quality of support after the sale  timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization 
maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing  engineering  quality standards  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
if we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments  or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position  our operations and financial performance will suffer 
the loss of panasonic avionics corporation or the us government as major customers or a significant reduction in sales to either or both of those two customers would reduce our sales and earnings 
in we had a concentration of sales to panasonic representing approximately of our sales and to the various military branches of the us government representing approximately of our sales 
the loss of one or both of these customers or a significant reduction in sales to them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel 
the loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
in addition  competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense  and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract  train and retain such personnel 
future terror attacks  war  or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business 
continued terror attacks  war or other disturbances could lead to further economic instability and decreases in demand for our products  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks world wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry 
the long term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown 
these attacks and the us government s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability 
if we are unable to adapt to technological change  demand for our products may be reduced 
the technologies related to our products have undergone  and in the future may undergo  significant changes 
to succeed in the future  we will need to continue to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive 
furthermore  our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge 
we may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive  and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers 
our new product development efforts may not be successful  which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements  and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers 
in addition  the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates  and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs 
if any of these events occur  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 

table of contents we depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and sub contractors that may not be fully funded  may be terminated  or may be awarded to our competitors 
the failure to be awarded these contracts or failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales 
sales to the us government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business 
the funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations  and congressional priorities are subject to change 
in addition  government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated 
a decline in governmental expenditures may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us 
we make estimates in accounting for long term contracts  and changes in these estimates may have significant impacts on our earnings 
in the test systems segment  the company has long term contracts with our customers  accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue representing approximately of consolidated sales was accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize revenue as work progresses toward completion as determined by the ratio of cumulative costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at completion  multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue  less cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods 
changes in estimates affecting sales  costs and profits are recognized in the period in which the change becomes known using the cumulative catch up method of accounting  resulting in the cumulative effect of changes reflected in the current period 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
for contracts with anticipated losses at completion  we establish a provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss and charge it against income in the period in which the loss becomes known 
when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable  the amounts representing performance incentives  penalties  contract claims  warranty costs or change orders are considered in estimating revenues  costs and profits 
if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations  our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted 
many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor 
failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer 
subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in addition  a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability 
our results of operations are affected by our fixed price contracts  which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns 
for the year ended december   fixed price contracts represented almost of the company s sales 
on fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price 
depending on the fixed price negotiated  these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract s fixed price 
however  we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit 
some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties 
failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems  development schedule slides  manufacturing difficulties  or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the failure of our products may damage our reputation  necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage  thereby requiring us to pay significant damages 
defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall 
we include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products 
if any of our products are defective  we could be required to 
table of contents redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products 
we are also exposed to product liability claims 
we carry aircraft and non aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms 
however  this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim 
a product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our facilities could be damaged by catastrophes which could reduce our production capacity and result in a loss of customers 
we conduct our operations in facilities located throughout the united states and canada 
these facilities could be damaged by fire  floods  high winds  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events 
although we carry property insurance  including business interruption insurance  our inability to meet customers schedules as a result of catastrophe may result in a loss of customers or significant additional costs such as penalty claims under customer contracts 
changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity 
pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions 
the most critical assumption is the discount rate 
other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age 
the discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control 
changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity 
we are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business  liquidity and operating results 
changes in the availability  terms and cost of capital  increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
at december   approximately of our debt was at fixed interest rates with the remaining percentage subject to variable interest rates 
in addition  our debt financing contains various financial covenants 
if our financial performance differs from our expectation  we may violate one or more of those covenants 
a covenant violation would require a waiver by the lenders or an alternative financing arrangement be achieved 
historically both choices have been available to us however in the current credit market environment it is difficult to predict the availability of these options in the future 
we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from our customers defaulting on their obligations to us 
the inability of our customers to pay us due to adverse economic conditions or their inability to access available credit could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
our international operations pose currency and other risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings 
we have manufacturing and sales operations in foreign countries 
in addition  our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers 
our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into us dollars 
the translation of our sales in foreign currencies  which are primarily the canadian dollar to the us dollar had an insignificant impact on both sales for using average exchange rates for compared to average exchange rates for and on sales for using average exchange rates for compared to average exchange rates for our stock price is volatile 
for the year ended december   our stock price ranged from a low of to a high of 
the price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates  changes in financial estimates  announcements of technological innovations  new products  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for companies in the aerospace industry in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the 
table of contents operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation  including rules related to bidding  billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims  and any non compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment 
like all government contractors  we are subject to risks associated with this contracting 
these risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties 
these fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules  employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards  receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims 
we have been  and expect to continue to be  subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies 
the failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation 
it could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts 
government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the united states and otherwise adversely affect our business 
our failure to obtain the requisite licenses  meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the united states 
compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position 
in order to sell our products in european union countries  we must satisfy certain technical requirements 
if we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products  our sales in europe would be restricted 
doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations  including  without limitation  regulations relating to import export control  technology transfer restrictions  foreign corrupt practices and anti boycott provisions 
failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities and could  in the extreme case  result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
if we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our revenue or operating results  our stock price could decline significantly 
our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including delays or cancellations of programs 
it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the trading price of our stock could decline significantly 
our sales and earnings may be reduced if we cannot successfully integrate dme s business 
if we are unable to successfully integrate dme s businesses subsequent to the acquisition on january   into our existing operations or if dme s business is unsuccessful in winning new government programs  our sales and earnings could be impacted 
we may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy 
growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results  including diversion of management time and attention from our core business  the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities  the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase  the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness  including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility  difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  and the potential loss of key employees  suppliers or customers of acquired businesses 
in addition  any acquisition  once successfully integrated  could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned  does not increase earnings  or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us

information includes the effects of the acquisition of dme on january  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview astronics corporation  through its subsidiaries astronics advanced electronic systems corp  luminescent systems inc  luminescent systems canada inc and dme corporation designs and manufactures electrical power generation systems  control and distribution systems  lighting systems and components  aircraft safety products and test  training and simulation systems 
with the acquisition of dme corporation dme  the company now operates in two distinct segments  aerospace and test systems 
we have six principal facilities located in new york state  washington state  new hampshire  two in florida and one in quebec  canada 
on january  we acquired dme  a designer and manufacturer of military test  training and simulation equipment  airfield lighting and aviation safety products 
we purchased of the outstanding 
table of contents stock of dme for approximately million 
the acquisition was financed primarily with a million  five year term note   shares of unregistered astronics common stock previously held as treasury shares  valued at million  and seller financing for million 
our aerospace segment serves four primary markets 
they are the military  commercial transport  business jet and faa airport markets 
we serve one primary market in the test systems segment  which is the military 
in the aerospace segment  the breakdown of sales to the commercial transport market  the military market  business jet market and the faa airport market were approximately   and  respectively 
in the test systems market  all of the sales were to the military market 
our strategy is to develop and maintain positions of technical leadership in chosen aerospace and test system markets  to leverage those positions to grow the amount of content and volume of product it sells to the markets in those segments and to selectively acquire businesses with similar technical capabilities that could benefit from our leadership position and strategic direction 
key factors affecting our growth and profitability are the rate at which new aircraft are produced  government funding of military programs  our ability to have our products designed into the plans for new aircraft and the rates at which aircraft owners  including commercial airlines  refurbish or install upgrades to their aircraft 
once designed into a new aircraft  the spare parts business is frequently retained by the company 
sales to the commercial transport market totaled approximately of our total revenue in our cabin electronics products which provide in seat power for passengers and power to in flight entertainment systems ife found on commercial airlines around the world accounted for the majority of our sales to this market 
since we have seen our sales to the commercial transport markets increase from million to over million in most of this growth has been driven by increased installations of our cabin electronics products used to power in flight entertainment systems and in seat power systems by airlines around the world 
maintaining and growing our sales to the commercial transport market will depend on airlines capital spending budgets for cabin up grades as well as for new aircraft such as the boeing and airbus a this investment by the airlines is impacted by their profits  cash flow and available financing as well as competitive pressures between the airlines to improve the travel experience for their passengers 
we expect the new aircraft  once in production will be equipped with more ife and in seat power than previous generation aircraft 
additionally  our ability to maintain and grow sales to this market depends on our ability to maintain our technological advantages over our competitors and maintain our relationships with major in flight entertainment suppliers and global airlines 
products sold to the business jet market include our cockpit lighting  airframe power and exterior lighting products 
sales to the business jet market are driven by our content on new aircraft and build rates of new aircraft 
in we saw volume decrease in the business jet market as the production rates for new business jets decreased during the year 
business jet oem build rates are significantly impacted by global wealth creation and corporate profitability which have been negatively affected during the past year by the global recession 
our sales to the business jet market will continue to be challenged in the upcoming year as business jet aircraft production rates are not expected to increase during as the global economy continues to struggle 
additionally  there continues to be a large supply of used aircraft in the market and financing of aircraft has become more challenging for prospective buyers 
despite the current market conditions  we continue to see a wide range of opportunities to employ our technology in the business jet markets  however there is risk involved in the development of any new aircraft 
products sold to the military market include our cockpit  exterior and cabin lighting  airframe power products and test  training and simulation systems 
the military market is dependent on governmental funding which can change from year to year 
risks are that overall spending may be reduced in the future  specific programs may be eliminated or that we fail to win new business through the competitive bid process 
astronics does not have significant reliance on any one program such that cancellation of a particular program will cause material financial loss 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities similar to past years regarding this market 

table of contents our faa airport market sales are typically comprised of sales of airfield lighting products including navigational lighting aids and airfield lighting products and providing design build lighting solutions to simplify lighting installation projects and provide seamless airfield upgrades for our customers 
each of the markets that we serve is presenting opportunities for our product lines that we expect will provide growth for the company over the long term 
we continue to look for opportunities in all of our markets to capitalize on our core competencies to expand our existing business and to grow through strategic acquisitions 
based on lower projected revenue and cash flows than previously anticipated  we determined that the carrying value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets from the test systems segment exceeded the fair value 
as a result of the impairment testing performed as of november   the company recorded an impairment charge of million associated with purchased intangible assets and million associated with goodwill in the fourth quarter of for additional information on impairment of long lived assets  refer to the critical accounting policies and notes and to our consolidated financial statements in
