we recycle  manufacture  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
our business is organized into the following five segments americas recycling  americas mills  americas fabrication  international mills and international marketing and distribution 
our domestic and international distribution business activities consist only of physical transactions and not market speculation 
americas recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  south carolina  tennessee and texas 

table of contents americas mills operations we conduct our domestic mills operations through a network of steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills or in the case of the arizona mill a micro mill  that produce one or more of reinforcing bar  angles  flats  rounds  small beams  fence post sections and other shapes  and a copper tube minimill which is aggregated with the company s steel minimills because it has similar economic characteristics  and one scrap metal shredder processing facility that directly supports the adjoining steel minimill 
americas fabrication operations we conduct our domestic fabrication operations through a network of steel plants that bend  weld  cut and fabricate steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  plants that produce steel fence posts  and plants that treat steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility 
international mills operations international mills includes our polish cmcz and croatian cmcs mills  as well as our recycling and fabrication operations in europe  and have been presented as a separate segment because the economic characteristics of the market and the regulatory environment in which our international mills operate is different from our domestic minimills 
we conduct our operations through two rolling mills that produce primarily reinforcing bar and high quality merchant products  a rolling mill that produces primarily wire rod  a specialty rod finishing mill  our scrap processing facilities that directly support the cmcz minimill  four steel fabrication plants primarily for reinforcing bar and mesh  and an electric arc furnace based steel pipe manufacturer 
international marketing and distribution operations we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures domestically and internationally 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are delivered based on the terms of the sale  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
when we estimate that a contract with one of our customers will result in a loss  we accrue the calculated loss as soon as it is probable and estimable 
we account for fabrication projects based on the percentage of completion accounting method 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
these reserves are based on historical trends  current market conditions and customers financial condition 

table of contents contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
we calculate our lifo reserve by using quantities and costs at period end and recording the resulting lifo income or expense in its entirety 
inventory cost for international and remaining inventories is determined by the first in  first out method  or fifo 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
goodwill we test for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit compared to its carrying value 
our reporting units are based on our internal reporting structure and represent an operating segment or a reporting level below an operating segment 
additionally  our reporting units are aggregated based upon similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  nature of production processes  type of customers and distribution methods 
we have determined our reporting units that have a significant amount of goodwill to be our domestic recycling and domestic fabrication segments 
we use a discounted cash flow model to calculate the fair value of our reporting units 
the model includes a number of significant assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows including discount rates  volumes  prices  capital expenditures and the impact of current market conditions 
these estimates could be materially impacted by adverse changes in market conditions 
we perform the goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment event may have occurred 
based on our analysis during the fourth quarter of  the estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the undiscounted future cash flows from operations 
if an impairment exists  the net book values are reduced to fair values as warranted 
our domestic and international mills  fabrication and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations are based upon judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives and are evaluated annually 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred

consolidated results of operations year ended august  in millions except share data net sales net earnings loss from continuing operations attributable to cmc per diluted share adjusted ebitda international net sales as of total sales lifo income expense effect on net earnings attributable to cmc per diluted share excludes divisions classified as discontinued operations 
last in  first out inventory valuation method 

table of contents in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with gaap 
we use adjusted ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairment charges as a non gaap performance measure 
in calculating adjusted ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation  amortization and impairment charges 
adjusted ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost in our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use adjusted ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments 
adjusted ebitda is also the target benchmark for our long term cash incentive performance plan for management and part of a debt compliance test for our revolving credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program 
reconciliations from net earnings loss from continuing operations attributable to cmc to adjusted editda are provided below for the years ended august in millions net earnings loss from continuing operations attributable to cmc interest expense income taxes benefit depreciation  amortization and impairment charges adjusted ebitda from continuing operations adjusted ebitda from discontinued operations adjusted ebitda our adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairment charges 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation  amortization and impairment charges are also necessary elements of our costs 
also  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings loss determined under gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
also  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation  amortization  impairment charges and income taxes 
the following events and performances had a significant financial impact during as compared to or are expected to be significant for our future operations in response to volatile prices  weakening demand  and continued global liquidity and credit crisis  we recorded the following consolidated expenses in continuing operations during lower of cost or market inventory adjustments of million and severance costs of million 
during the second quarter of  we decided to exit the joist and deck business and incurred million of charges to impair fixed assets and intangibles  million of severance and million of inventory charges 
this division previously included in the americas fabrication segment is presented as a discontinued operation 
we recorded after tax lifo income of million per diluted share compared to lifo income of million per diluted share in improved demand drove prices and volumes for our americas recycling segment which resulted in an increase in net sales and a million increase in adjusted operating results 
net sales of the americas mills segment increased due to higher shipments but adjusted operating profit declined from lower average selling prices combined with an increase in material costs 
our americas fabrication segment showed a decrease in net sales and an adjusted operating loss of million from the continued decline in market demand and lower average selling prices 
net sales of our international mills segment remained flat as compared to but showed a decrease in adjusted operating loss from improved demand and pricing in construction markets in poland offset by continuing losses in croatia 

table of contents our international marketing and distribution segment reported a decline in net sales  however  reported adjusted operating profit of million resulting from margin expansion from this segment s global presence and ability to participate in markets experiencing economic recovery 
significant capital expenditure projects in include a new flexible rolling mill at cmcz poland and a new furnace at cmcs croatia which were completed during the third quarter of a new ladle metallurgical station was commissioned in september segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollar amounts below are calculated before income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we use adjusted operating profit loss to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit loss is the sum of our earnings loss before income taxes and financing costs 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication international mills international marketing and distribution corporate eliminations adjusted operating profit loss americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication international mills international marketing and distribution corporate eliminations discontinued operations lifo impact on adjusted operating profit loss lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent inventory purchases or goods manufactured are sold first 
this results in current sales prices offset against current inventory costs 
in periods of rising prices it has the effect of eliminating inflationary profits from operations 
in periods of declining prices it has the effect of eliminating deflationary losses from operations 
in either case the goal is to reflect economic profit 
the table below reflects lifo income or expense representing decreases or increases in the lifo inventory reserve

table of contents compared to americas recycling during  scrap prices  metal margins and shipments increased as this segment began recovering from the economic recession that significantly impacted operating results in adjusted operating profit for was driven by improved margins from both prices and volumes and cost containment efforts 
metal margins were negatively impacted by lifo expense of million in as compared to lifo income of million in ferrous pricing was stronger as domestic mill operating rates increased and general manufacturing output was higher 
nonferrous pricing was driven by strong export demand  primarily from asia 
we exported of our ferrous scrap tonnage and of our nonferrous scrap tonnage during the year 
the following table reflects our americas recycling segment s average selling prices per ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august increase amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped americas mills we include our five domestic steel mills and our copper tube minimill in our americas mills segment 
within the segment  adjusted operating profit for our five domestic steel mills was million for as compared to million for adjusted operating profit primarily declined from ferrous margin compression as scrap prices increased at a greater rate than average selling prices and start up costs at our new mill in arizona 
additionally  we recorded lifo expense of million in as compared to lifo income of million in our mills ran at utilization during as compared to during rebar accounted for of tonnage shipped  a decrease from in higher production rates as well as price increases in some alloys and natural gas rates resulted in an overall increase of million in electrode  alloys and energy costs

table of contents americas fabrication this segment continues to face challenging market conditions including strong competition  weak selling prices  lack luster demand and high steel costs eroding profits 
as a result  this segment experienced significant declines in the average selling price and shipments which resulted in an adjusted operating loss of million as compared to a profit of million in results were also negatively impacted by a decline in lifo income of million in as compared to public works remained the most positive end use markets for this segment 
although most divisions reported a loss for the year  our post plants and specialty heat treating operations were profitable for the composite average fabrication selling price was per ton  down from  per ton in the tables below shows our average fabrication selling prices per short ton and total fabrication plant shipments for the year ended august decrease average selling price amount rebar structural post excludes stock and buyout sales

metal margin continued to be compressed as ferrous scrap prices were driven by global demand while average selling prices increased slightly as the local market remained intensely competitive 
shipments included thousand tons of billets compared to thousand tons of billets in the prior year

table of contents our fabrication operations in poland and germany had an adjusted operating loss of million during  a decrease in adjusted operating loss of million from these results are included in the overall results of cmcz discussed above 
international marketing and distribution this segment reported a decrease in sales  but an increase in adjusted operating results primarily from our international geographic presence and ability to participate in markets recovering from the global recession  primarily asia and several markets in europe 
additionally  improved pricing minimized the need for contract and inventory loss charges during each of our major geographic marketing operations were profitable for corporate our corporate expenses decreased million in to million primarily due to our cost containment initiative and fewer costs associated with the global installation of sap software 
consolidated data the lifo method of inventory valuation increased our net loss from continuing operations by million per diluted share for as compared to increasing our net earnings by million per diluted share for our overall selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by million  or  for as compared to sg a expenses primarily declined from our cost containment initiative  reductions in bad debt expense and fewer costs incurred with the global installation of sap software 
our interest expense decreased by million to million during as compared to from the favorable impact of interest rate swap transactions of million and a reduction in the use of discounted letters of credit offset by less capitalized interest as a result of completed capital projects during our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended august  was as compared to in our effective tax rate for varies from our statutory rate due to lower tax rate jurisdictions incurring losses along with the recording of valuation allowances against the deferred tax asset of the company s croatian and german subsidiaries due to the uncertainty of their realization 
discontinued operations adjusted operating results for our divisions classified as discontinued operations decreased to a loss of million from adjusted operating profit of million in the decrease in adjusted operating results is primarily due to significant costs associated with our decision to exit our joist and deck business during the second quarter of additionally  these divisions recorded a lifo income of million in as compared to lifo income of million in the results for include our joist and deck business in addition to one of our us trading divisions which was winding down operations in and dissolved as of august  outlook by august   we believe the long delayed recovery in us non residential construction should begin 
public non residential construction remains our most consistent domestic market 
through september  barely half of the stimulus dollars aimed at highway funds had been dispersed 
with high unemployment  tight credit  and a general lack of confidence  private non residential construction will  in all likelihood  remain weak during the year ending august  china has many years of growth ahead 
poland will be in high gear in anticipation of hosting the euro cup 
croatia s accession to the european union should be resolved  opening new markets for pipe sales 
by segment  we anticipate americas recycling to improve as industrial manufacturing recovers 
our americas mills should benefit as well 
though our micromill in arizona has proven new technology  it will require significant recovery in state budgets  particularly california  to meet profit expectations 
our americas fabrication operations are mid to late cycle exposed  the challenges will continue 
with a new regional structure in the americas  we believe we can better harness the benefits of our vertical integration 
our greatest opportunities for turnarounds are the utilization of our enhanced product mix in poland and stemming our losses in croatia 
our global marketing expertise is expected to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
and everywhere  we will strive to operate under a lower cost structure with improvements in business processes and efficiencies 

table of contents compared to americas recycling during  this segment experienced a decline in scrap prices and market demand resulting in reduced net sales and an adjusted operating loss as compared to  a year with record operating results 
the decline in gross margins for ferrous and nonferrous was almost evenly attributable to both volume and prices as compared to the decrease in margins was partially offset by a swing of million in lifo income due to declining prices during ferrous and nonferrous pricing reversed the declining trends of the opening six months of fiscal we exported of our ferrous scrap and of our nonferrous scrap during the year 
the following table reflects our americas recycling segment s average selling prices per ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august decrease amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped americas mills we include our four domestic steel minimills and our copper tube minimill in our americas mills segment 
while this segment had a decrease in net sales during as compared to  adjusted operating profit increased due to lifo income recorded in as compared to lifo expense recorded in within the segment  adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for as compared to million for metal margins increased over primarily due to rapidly declining ferrous scrap prices in excess of selling prices and a swing in lifo income of million 
tons shipped declined as compared to  but were rising late in fiscal as a result of restocking  seasonal demand and continued public sector projects

table of contents the table below reflects our copper tube minimill s operating statistics for the year ended august decrease pounds in millions amount pounds shipped pounds produced americas fabrication during  rebar  structural  and construction services were profitable while post operations incurred losses 
profits were attributable to margin improvements on lower material costs supplying relatively high priced backlog shipments as compared to which included rising prices and margin compression for our fabrication business 
as the economic conditions continued to deteriorate during  the prices and the volume associated with the backlog decreased leading to lower sales and shipments during the end of fiscal losses in post operations were caused by high priced raw material in inventory running through production and strong competition for dwindling tons in joist operations 
the composite average fabrication selling price was  per ton  up from per ton in rebar shipments were positively impacted by acquisitions of cmc coating and cmc regional steel

table of contents cmcs reported an adjusted operating loss of million during as compared to an adjusted operating loss of million during the decline is primarily due to decreased demand including the collapse of energy markets  increased chinese competition in the north africa and middle east markets and inventory valuation adjustments 
cmcs melted thousand tons  rolled thousand tons and shipped thousand tons during as compared to thousand tons melted  thousand tons rolled and thousand tons shipped during our yields have steadily improved during  and we have successfully completed castings of all major sizes of billets from phase one of our upgraded melt shop 
our fabrication operations in poland and germany had an adjusted operating loss of million during  a decrease in adjusted operating results of million during these results are included in the overall results of cmcz discussed above 
we opened a fabrication facility in zyrardow  poland  located west of warsaw during international marketing and distribution this segment s net sales decreased and we incurred an adjusted operating loss during driven by reduced market demand and inventory valuation adjustments as pricing fell during the downturn in steel markets continues in europe while parts of asia and australia are showing signs of recovery 
the global financial crisis contributed to customer noncompliance with contracts  market claims and price renegotiations 
additionally  demand was negatively impacted as customers were not willing to be exposed to lead times for imported material in the volatile pricing environment 
our largest challenge for this segment remains in our domestic steel import and distribution business which incurred substantial losses 
this segment recorded approximately million of inventory charges  million of bad debt expense and million of contract losses during our raw materials import business remained profitable 
in august  cmc s board approved a plan to offer for sale a division which was involved with the buying  selling and distribution of nonferrous metals 
at august   in connection with the closure of the division  all inventory of this division had been sold or absorbed by other divisions of the company 
see note  discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements 
corporate our corporate expenses decreased million in to million primarily due to reductions in bonus and profit sharing expenses and costs incurred for the global installation of sap software which were offset by increased salary and severance expense 
consolidated data the lifo method of inventory valuation increased our net earnings from continuing operations by million per diluted share for as compared to decreasing our net earnings by million diluted share for our overall selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by million for as compared to sg a expense primarily declined due to decreased bonus and profit sharing expenses and cost incurred for the global installation of sap software partially offset by increased salary expense because of company growth  including recent acquisitions  increased bad debt expense and severance expense 
our interest expense increased by million to million during as compared to primarily due to the issuance of million in senior unsecured notes in august and increased debt outstanding internationally during the current fiscal year which was offset in part by the repayment of million senior unsecured notes in february our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended august  was as compared to in our effective tax rate for varies from our statutory rate due to lower tax rate jurisdictions predominately international incurring losses and higher rate jurisdictions generating income 
as of august   it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings of non us subsidiaries 
as a result  the deferred income tax liability relating to prior periods has been reversed positively impacting our effective tax rate for discontinued operations adjusted operating profit for our divisions classified as discontinued operations increased to million from adjusted operating loss of million in the change primarily resulted from lifo income of million in as compared to lifo expense of million in offset by increased operating losses and costs incurred with ceasing operations for one of our us trading operations in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities  however  we could be adversely affected if our banks  the potential buyers of our commercial paper or other of the traditional sources supplying our short term borrowing requirements refuse to honor their contractual commitments  cease lending or declare bankruptcy 
while we believe the lending institutions participating in our credit arrangements are financially capable  recent events in the global credit markets  including the failure  takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions  have created uncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades

the availability under the revolving credit agreement is reduced by million of commercial paper outstanding as of august  with our investment grade credit ratings we believe we have access to additional financing and refinancing  if needed 
we utilize uncommitted credit facilities to meet short term working capital needs 
our uncommitted credit facilities primarily support import letters of credit including accounts payable settled under bankers acceptances  foreign exchange transactions and short term advances 
our million notes due november  million notes due july and our million notes due august require interest only payments until maturity 
our cmcz note requires quarterly interest and principal payments and our cmcs facility requires quarterly interest and principal payments beginning in we expect cash from operations to be sufficient to meet all interest and principal payments due within the next twelve months and we believe we will be able to get additional financing or refinance these notes when they mature 
certain of our financing agreements include various financial covenants 
we amended the existing revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization agreement to modify the covenant structure which requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to interest expense of not less than to for the six month cumulative period ended august   nine month cumulative period ending november   twelve month cumulative period ending february  and for each fiscal quarter on a rolling twelve month cumulative period thereafter 
at august   our interest coverage ratio was to 
the agreements also require us to maintain liquidity of at least million cash  short term investments  and accounts receivable securitization capacity combined through november  and at august  we had liquidity of million 
the agreements did not change the existing debt to capitalization ratio covenant which requires us to maintain a ratio not greater than to 
at august   the company s debt to capitalization ratio was to 
current market conditions  including volatility of metal prices  lifo adjustments  mark to market adjustments on inventories  reserves for future job losses  the level of allowance for doubtful accounts  the amount of interest capitalized on capital projects and the effect of interest rate changes on our interest rate swaps could impact our ability to meet the interest coverage ratio for the first quarter of fiscal the revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization are used as alternative sources of liquidity 
our public debt does not contain these covenants 

table of contents the cmcz term note contains certain financial covenants 
the agreement requires a debt to equity ratio of not greater than to and a tangible net worth to exceed pln million million 
at august   cmcz was in compliance with both of these covenants with the debt to equity ratio at to and tangible net worth of pln million million 
additionally  the agreement requires a debt to ebitda ratio not greater than to and an interest coverage ratio of not less than to 
at august   cmcz was not in compliance with these covenants which resulted in a guarantee by the company continuing to be effective 
as a result of the guarantee  the financial covenant requirements became void  however  all other terms of the loan remain in effect  including the payment schedule 
the guarantee will cease to be effective when cmcz is in compliance with the financial covenants of the parent guarantee for two consecutive quarters 
we regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable 
recent economic conditions and a continued recession have had negative effects on the liquidity of our customers which has resulted in higher defaults on accounts receivable and additional bad debt expense 
we actively monitor our accounts receivable and record allowances as soon as we believe they are uncollectible based on current market conditions and customers financial condition 
continued pressure on the liquidity of our customers could result in additional reserves as we make our assessments in the future 
we use credit insurance both in the us and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency 
we estimate the amount of credit insured receivables and those covered by export letters of credit was approximately of total receivables at august  off balance sheet arrangements for added flexibility  we may secure financing through securitization and sales of certain accounts receivable both in the us and internationally 
see note  sales of accounts receivable  to the consolidated financial statements 
we may sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis to replace those receivables that have been collected from our customers 
our domestic securitization program contains certain cross default provisions whereby a termination event could occur should we default under another credit arrangement  and contains covenants that conform to the same requirements contained in our revolving credit agreement 
compliance with these covenants is discussed above 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices

during  we generated million of net cash flows from operating activities as compared to generating million in significant fluctuations in working capital were as follows accounts receivable accounts receivable increased during as sales and prices improved  as compared to sales and prices significantly declining during due to the global recession  inventory more cash was used during as inventory balances were significantly reduced at the end of fiscal because of customer destocking in  and accounts payable less cash was used during as current liabilities had been reduced at the end of fiscal due to low volume from the global recession and as higher volume in increased accounts payable 
during  we used million of net cash flows from investing activities as compared to million in we invested million in property  plant and equipment during  a decrease of million from additionally  proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment increased million as compared to these were partially offset by a use of cash for deposits for letters of credit of million 
we expect our total capital budget for fiscal to be approximately million 
we continually assess our capital spending and reevaluate our requirements based on current and expected results 
during  we generated million from financing activities as compared to using million during the increase in cash generated was primarily due to the increase in documentary letters of credit of million in as compared to the decrease in documentary letters of credit of million in and net borrowings on short term and long term debt of million in as compared to net repayments of million in during  we made no purchases of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program compared to using million in our cash dividends have remained consistent at approximately million for both periods 

table of contents our contractual obligations for the next twelve months of approximately million are typically expenditures with normal revenue producing activities 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities and debt facilities are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt notes payable interest commercial paper operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest payments related to our short term debt are not included in the table as they do not represent a significant obligation as of august  includes minimum lease payment obligations for non cancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  regardless of the duration of the agreement 
agreements with variable terms are excluded because we are unable to estimate the minimum amounts 
another significant obligation relates to capital expenditures 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our insurance providers and suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements  of which million is cash collateralized 
all of the commitments expire within one year 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the potential impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations  our financial position or our liquidity 
however  they may have a material impact on operations for a particular quarter 
environmental and other matters see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations in all locations where we have operating facilities 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over nine decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  may expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of contaminated sites 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a prp at ten sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
at august   based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we had million accrued for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with eight of the ten cercla sites 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
we are not able to reasonably estimate an amount for the two other cercla sites 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these sites for the years ended august   and were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined  or into publicly owned treatment works 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters or into publicly owned treatment works  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa s regulations and comparable state regulations may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge or non compliance with permit requirements  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny 
table of contents in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources may be required to construct emission sources using what is referred to as the best available control technology  or in any areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards  using methods that satisfy requirements for lowest achievable emission rate 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require specific sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
in  we incurred environmental expenses of million 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
during  million of our capital expenditures related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million was classified as other long term liabilities 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive quarters 
we paid dividends in at the rate of per share for all quarters

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the company or its subsidiaries 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on metal commodity futures exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity futures contracts for copper  aluminum  nickel and zinc 
these futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margin due to the volatility of the commodity prices on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to minimal gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
natural gas we enter into natural gas forward contracts as economic hedges of the company s americas mills operations based on anticipated consumption of natural gas in order to mitigate the risk of unanticipated increase to operating cost due to the volatility of natural gas prices 
freight we occasionally enter into freight forward contracts when sales commitments to customers include a fixed price freight component in order to minimize the effect of the volatility of ocean freight rates 
interest rates we enter into interest rate swap contracts to maintain a portion of our debt obligations at variable interest rates 
these interest rate swap contracts  under which we have agreed to pay variable rates of interest and receive fixed rates of interest  are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt 
our interest rate swap contract commitments were million as of august  if interest rates increased or decreased by one percentage point  the impact on interest expense related to our variable rate debt would be approximately million and the impact on fair value of our long term debt would be approximately million as of august  the following tables provide certain information regarding the foreign exchange and commodity financial instruments discussed above
