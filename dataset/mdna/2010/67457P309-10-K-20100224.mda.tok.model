item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included beginning on page f of this form k 
the discussion in this form k contains both historical information and forward looking statements 
a number of factors affect our operating results and could cause our actual future results to differ materially from any forward looking results discussed below 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as anticipates  appears  believes  continue  could  estimates  expects  feels  goal  hope  intends  may  our future success depends  plans  potential  predicts  projects  reasonably  seek to continue  should  thinks  will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in addition  historical information should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  the risks discussed in part i  item a of this form k under the caption risk factors 
these factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements 
moreover  we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform these statements to actual results 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of overview we develop  market and support innovative broadband access products designed to enable telecom service providers to offer  voice  video and data  or triple play  services over both copper and fiber optic networks 
our broadband loop carrier  or blc  is an integrated hardware and software platform that uses internet protocol  or ip  and ethernet technologies to increase the capabilities of local access networks  enabling our customers to deliver advanced services  including voice over ip  or voip  websurfing and other high speed data communications services  ip based television  or iptv  including high definition television  or hdtv  or in some cases all three of these services  referred to as triple play 
our platform simultaneously supports traditional voice services  enabling our customers to leverage their existing networks and migrate to ip services and networks without disruption 
in addition to providing our customers with increased bandwidth  our products provide incremental value by offering software based features to improve the quality  resiliency and security of triple play services 
our blc products enable all of these services over either traditional twisted pair copper telephone lines or over newer fiber to the premise  or fttp  lines 
we market our products through a combination of direct and indirect channels 
our direct sales efforts are focused on the north american independent operating company  or ioc  segment of the telecom service provider market 
these are companies that never were a part of the original bell system 
we have expanded our sales activities to include europe  the middle east  africa  the caribbean  latin america  the pacific islands and certain other international locations  nevertheless sales outside north america continue to represent an insignificant portion of our business 
as of december   we had shipped our blc platform to over telecommunications customers 
from our inception through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we realized income from operations and were profitable on a net income basis during the quarters ended december   december   september   and for the year ended december  previously  we had not been profitable on a quarterly or annual basis  excluding the quarter ended december   in which we realized modest operating income 
table of contents of  we experienced operating and net losses in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and for fiscal as a whole 
throughout  we experienced a softening in our business as we experienced declining customer orders 
we believe this softening was attributable in part to delays associated with our customers evaluations of strategic investment decisions concerning their movement from copper wire to fiber  in part to a shift in our customer base toward longer term loan projects funded by the us department of agriculture s rural utilities service  or rus program  and in part to general macro economic conditions which continued to deteriorate throughout we cannot predict the timing or amount of orders and we expect to continue to experience some delays or cancellations of customer orders in in light of macroeconomic conditions  we have limited visibility into customer purchasing patterns and believe that our revenues and operating results will depend substantially on trends in capital equipment spending by iocs 
currently  we expect capital equipment budgets may continue to be reduced in  but believe that the overall negative budget trend could be offset  in part  by government broadband economic stimulus programs and spending initiatives 
nevertheless  we cannot predict the timing or financial impact  if any  on our business and operating results from government economic stimulus programs 
in october we restated our previously released consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal periods i the fiscal years ended december  and december   ii each of the interim quarterly periods in the fiscal years ended december  and december   and iii each of the interim quarterly periods ended march  june  and september  prior to january   when we adopted a calendar year end for fiscal reporting purposes  we prepared our consolidated financial statements with the end of each quarter falling on the last sunday of each calendar quarter 
as a result  our accounting quarters did not necessarily coincide with the last day of the calendar month 
effective january   we adopted a calendar fiscal year end 
the quarter end dates for fiscal were march  june  september  and december critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  litigation  accounts receivable reserves  sales returns reserves  warranty reserve and valuation of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition occam generally recognizes revenue under staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  in the period when all of the requirements of sab have been met persuasive evidence of sales arrangements  
table of contents delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the company enters into transactions with value added resellers where the resellers may not have the ability to pay for these sales independent of payment to them by the end user 
in these cases  the company does not recognize revenue until payment has been received  provided the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
the company sells hardware products that contain embedded operating system software  which the company has determined are incidental to the hardware products 
revenue is recognized for these products under sab the company has one minor software network management product which is a stand alone product not essential to the functionality of other products that the company sells 
revenue is recognized for this product in accordance with fasb accounting standard codification topic  software 
the amount of sales of this product and the related revenue recognized to date by the company have been immaterial 
in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
the company elected to early adopt this accounting guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for applicable transactions 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the company enters into transactions that represent multiple element arrangements  which may include training and post sales technical support and maintenance to our customers as needed to assist them in installation or use of our products  and makes provisions for these costs in the periods of sale 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
in october  fasb amended the accounting standards to allow the use of best estimate of selling price in addition to vsoe and tpe for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
a vendor is now required to use its best estimate of the selling price when vsoe or third party evidence tpe of the selling price cannot be determined 
the company elected to early adopt this accounting guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for applicable transactions 
when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  the company uses estimated selling price esp in its allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
esp is generally used for new products  and it applies to a small proportion of the company s arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company determines esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  geographies  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  and pricing practices 

table of contents in certain circumstances  the company enters into arrangements with customers who receive financing support in the form of long term low interest rate loans from the united states department of agriculture s rus program 
the terms of the rus contracts provide that in certain instances transfer of title of the company s products does not occur until customer acceptance  however the company waited for final cash payment on these contracts before recognizing revenue 
effective january  based on historical experience  the company has determined that revenue recognition on rus contracts is appropriate upon customer acceptance  given the remaining revenue recognition criteria  such as collectability  under sab have been met 
as a result the company recognized approximately million in revenue for year ended december  based on customer acceptance  not final cash payment 
we warrant our products for periods up to five years and record an estimated warranty accrual when shipped 
valuation of inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of acquisition cost or market value  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand and market conditions and compare them with current inventory levels 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax asset to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
for  and  our net deferred tax assets have been offset with a full valuation allowance 
loss contingencies we evaluate our estimated potential financial exposure for loss contingencies  particularly the pending litigation matters discussed in note and the fairpoint bankruptcy filing discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  we accrue an estimated loss related to a contingency if a it is probable that a liability had been incurred and future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss at the date of the consolidated financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimated potential liability could materially impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we have not recorded an accrual for an estimated loss for the ipo allocation case because we believe the anticipated settlement amounts are covered by our insurance policies 
product warranties we provide a standard warranty with the sale of our products for up to five years from the date of shipment 
the estimated cost of providing the product warranty is recorded at the time of shipment 
we maintain product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the 
table of contents quality of our suppliers 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual history  projected return and failure rates and current repair costs 
our estimates are based on the actual number of products returned for repairs  an estimate of products that may be returned for warranty repair and estimated costs of repair depending on the type of service required 
these estimates require us to examine past warranty issues and consider their continuing impact in the future 
our accrual is based on consideration of all these factors which are known as of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent that actual warranty repairs are higher than our estimates  our costs will increase 
the costs for warranty returns totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
stock based compensation effective beginning the first fiscal quarter of  we adopted fasb accounting standard codification topic using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation costs for all awards granted after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding at the date of adoption are measured at estimated fair value and included in cost of sales and operating expenses over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
prior period amounts presented herein have not been restated to reflect the adoption of fasb accounting standard codification topic upon adoption of fasb accounting standard codification topic  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the use of the black scholes model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  forfeitures  and expected dividends 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we do not anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on the annualized weekly historical volatility of our stock price and we believe it is indicative of future volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns with consideration to our industry peers of similar size with similar option vesting periods 
our analysis of stock price volatility and option lives involves management s best estimates at the time of determination 
fasb accounting standard codification topic also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply an estimated forfeiture rate that is derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock  including restricted stock units 
fair value is determined by using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
the fair value of these awards is recognized to expense over the requisite service period of the awards 
during  certain performance related awards were granted to our officers and certain employees that will become exercisable upon the achievement of certain performance criteria and the confirmation of such achievement by the company s audit committee upon its approval of the company s audited financial statements for fiscal year during   and stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock totaled   and  respectively 
the stock based compensation expense included  related to the performance based units  granted in the third quarter of 
table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended december   december  and december  revenue in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended december  december  december  revenue our revenue is principally comprised of our blc series system product line  onts  cabinets and related accessories 
revenue decreased by million  or  to million in as compared to revenue of million in we believe the decrease in revenue was primarily due to the global economic recession and credit contraction and a continued delay in customer purchase decisions as they evaluate the timing and availability of potential government broadband stimulus funds 
we cannot predict the timing or financial impact  if any  of government stimulus programs 
in  we continued to experience a slow down in customer bookings activity 
in the short term we expect that booking activity may vary depending on our customer s ability to make capital investments using their own funds  access to credit facilities or other loan program funds 
revenue increased by million or to million in as compared to revenue of million in the increase in our revenue was due to higher sales of copper product as well as revenue from newly released gpon products in mid we believe our revenues in the second half of were also adversely affected by our then pending audit committee investigation and financial restatement 
we expect that current global economic conditions will likely have an adverse impact on our business in  in particular as carriers evaluate capital spending budgets due to the uncertainty as to the approval  timing and amount of stimulus awards as well as a potentially difficult economic environment

our gross margin in 
table of contents was as compared to in the increase was attributable to lower product and warranty costs 
we expect that our gross margin will vary from quarter to quarter due in part to product mix  average selling price changes and manufacturing cost changes  including warranty related costs 
to the extent that we introduce new products into the market  we anticipate our gross margin will fluctuate primarily as a function of our product mix 
for example  our gross margin percentages were   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
to the extent that cabinets and other lower margin products represent an increased percentage of our total revenue in any period  it will tend to reduce our gross margin percentage

stock based compensation expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this net increase was primarily attributable to the stock based compensation expense of million related to the performance based equity incentive awards granted during the third quarter of and additional grants of options and awards during the year

for the years ended december   and  we recorded income tax benefit of  and income tax expense of  and  respectively  for federal and state income taxes 
the decrease in the income tax expense is primarily attributable to federal refundable tax credits and net operating loss carrybacks available under a change in the tax law during the fourth quarter of net operating loss carry forwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million to offset federal and state future taxable income  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
in addition  we have federal research tax credits of million and state research tax credits of million 
the federal research tax credits will expire beginning in state credits may be carried forward indefinitely 
we believe an ownership change may have occurred  as defined by sections and of the internal revenue code irc  which could result in the forfeiture of a significant portion of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
we are currently analyzing whether a change occurred and the related impact on our gross deferred tax assets  if any 
as our analysis is not complete  the impact to gross deferred tax assets is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources our future capital requirements depend on many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
we expect our cash used in operations to decrease in at a lesser rate as compared to in part due to cost control initiatives implemented in we believe that existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the next twelve months 
however  these cash flow and operating results expectations are subject to numerous assumptions  many of which may not actually occur 
if some or all of such assumptions do not occur  our results may be substantially lower or different than expected  and our cash resources could be reduced faster than currently anticipated 
such assumptions include  without limitation  assumptions that new product introductions will occur on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance  that customer testing and service provider deployments occur as anticipated  that our customer base will continue to grow  that we do not experience an adverse result in existing litigation or new legal proceedings  and that our industry s competitive landscape will not change adversely 
for more information about the risks relating to our business  please read carefully the section of this report entitled risk factors 
a significant portion of our cash balances are restricted to secure performance bonds which we are sometimes required to post in connection with customer purchases under the rus program of the united states department of agriculture 
restricted cash totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to devote capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to support our sales and marketing  and to fund general corporate activities 
we may also consider making strategic investments in complementary products or technologies  which could require further cash expenditures

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance our operations over the next months 
although we believe these funds will be sufficient to maintain and expand our operations in accordance with our business strategy  we may need additional funds in the future 
if we are unable to raise additional financing when and if needed  we may be required to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives

sfas establishes the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the single source of authoritative gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities  except for the rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the codification does not change gaap 
sfas is effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after september  the adoption of this standard only impacts the references to the accounting standards 
references to accounting standards in this form k now refer to the relevant asc topic

in april  the fasb issued three related staff positions i fsp  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  or fsp  ii sfas and sfas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  or fsp and fsp  and iii sfas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  or fsp and apb  which are effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  fsp provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities under sfas in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
fsp and fsp modify the requirements for recognizing other than temporarily impaired debt securities and revise the existing impairment model for such securities  by modifying the current intent and ability indicator in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired 
fsp and apb enhance the disclosure of instruments under the scope of sfas for both interim and annual periods 
the above staff positions did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the above staff positions and abp were codified in the asc topic on financial instruments

r accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  or fsp r fsp r amends the provisions in statement r for the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations 
the fsp eliminates the distinction between contractual and non contractual contingencies  including the initial recognition and measurement criteria in statement r and instead carries forward most of the provisions in sfas for acquired contingencies 
fsp r is effective for contingent assets and contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we believe the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted  but the effect on us will depend upon our level of acquisition activity 
fas r was codified in the asc topic on business combinations
