item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an award winning airline with a differentiated product and a commitment to customer service that offers competitive fares primarily on point to point routes 
our value proposition includes operating a young  fuel efficient fleet with more legroom than any other domestic airline s coach product  free in flight entertainment  pre assigned seating  unlimited snacks  and the airline industry s only customer bill of rights 
at december   we served destinations in states  puerto rico  and eleven countries in the caribbean and latin america and operated over flights a day with a fleet of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft 
in  we reported net income of million and an operating margin of  as compared to a net loss of million and an operating margin of in the year over year improvement in our financial performance was primarily a result of a decrease in our realized fuel price and a net million holding loss related to the valuation of our auction rate securities  or ars  in our goal is to become americas favorite airline for our employees whom we refer to as crewmembers  customers and shareholders 
our plan in achieving this goal is dependent upon continuing to provide superior customer service and delivering the jetblue experience 
our financial strategy currently includes a commitment to positive free cash flow and long term sustainable growth while also maintaining an adequate liquidity position 
our commitment to these goals drives a focus on controlling costs  maximizing unit revenues  managing capital expenditures  and disciplined growth 
our disciplined growth begins with managing the growth  size and age of our fleet 
in  in response to continuing uncertain economic conditions  we continued to carefully manage the size of our fleet 
as a result  aircraft capital expenditures were significantly reduced from previous years 
we modified our airbus a purchase agreement in july resulting in the deferral of three aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in to and canceling six options to purchase aircraft at a future date 
we also modified our embraer purchase agreement three times rescheduling deliveries and options originally scheduled for delivery between and to through during the year  we increased the size of our a operating fleet by three aircraft and our embraer operating fleet by six aircraft 
in february  as part of broader ongoing discussions  we further amended our airbus purchase agreement  deferring six aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in and to this amendment had the effect of reducing our capital expenditures by million in related pre delivery deposits 
we are currently scheduled to take delivery of four aircraft in we may further slow our fleet growth through additional aircraft sales  leasing of aircraft  returns of leased aircraft and or deferral of aircraft deliveries 
our disciplined growth has also allowed us to optimize our route network 
the growth of our route network in was primarily through the addition of new destinations in the caribbean and latin america  markets which have historically matured more quickly than mainland flights of a comparable distance 
we have approximately of our capacity in the caribbean and latin america  we expect this number to continue to grow in we added eight new destinations in  six of which were in the caribbean and latin america  compared to two new destinations that were added in and five that were added in we have also strengthened our position as the largest carrier at boston s logan international airport in terms of number of seats offered and destinations served 
in  we plan to continue to focus on our boston and caribbean expansion 
in november  we launched a commercial agreement with deutsche lufthansa ag  or lufthansa  providing our customers with convenient connections at of our domestic locations to lufthansa s network of over locations overseas and providing lufthansa s customers access to our growing network 
in november  we also launched an improved version of our customer loyalty program  trueblue 
the program was re designed based on customer feedback  and is aimed at making our frequent flyer benefits more robust  rewarding  and flexible 
trueblue points are earned based on the value paid for a flight as opposed to the length of travel 
under the enhanced program  there are no blackout dates for award flights and 
table of contents points expirations can be extended 
based on extensive customer surveys  we believe this enhanced program will make our product more appealing to the business customer 
on january  we implemented a new integrated customer service system  which includes a reservations system  revenue management system  revenue accounting system  and customer loyalty management system 
transitioning to this new platform offers many benefits which we believe will position us well for our long term growth 
these benefits include added flexibility in the complex environments we operate under  opportunities for future codeshare and interline agreements  customer relationship management  ancillary revenue opportunities  improved functionality of our website  and improved revenue management capabilities 
in an effort to reduce delays and modernize the airport  the faa and the port authority of new york and new jersey  or panynj  have been undertaking major construction work at jfk 
their plans include the creation of new taxiways and holding pads  runway widening and rehabilitation  as well as the installation of new ground radar  lighting and other navigation equipment 
most significantly  this project will include the closure and rehabilitation of the most important runway in our network 
the jfk runway is scheduled to be closed from march through june  while we believe the results of this project will ultimately help to alleviate some of the challenges of operating at jfk  our operations may be adversely impacted during the runway closure 
in order to help mitigate the impact of this closure  we  and the other major domestic carriers operating at jfk have agreed to reduce flights throughout the closure period 
we derive our revenue primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
passenger revenue accounted for of our total operating revenues for the year ended december  revenues generated from international routes  excluding puerto rico  accounted for of our total passenger revenues in revenue is recognized either when transportation is provided or after the ticket or customer credit expires 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles 
we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher revenue per available seat mile  or rasm 
our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare and  in certain markets  utilize our network to maximize connecting opportunities while continuing to provide our customers with competitive fares 
when we enter a new market our fares are designed to stimulate demand  particularly from fare conscious leisure and business travelers who might otherwise have used alternate forms of transportation or would not have traveled at all 
in addition to our regular fare structure  we frequently offer sale fares with shorter advance purchase requirements in most of the markets we serve and match the sale fares offered by other airlines 
other revenue consists primarily of fees charged to customers in accordance with our published policies relating to reservation changes and baggage limitations  the marketing component of trueblue point sales  concession revenues  revenues associated with transporting mail and cargo  rental income and revenues earned by our subsidiary  livetv  llc  for the sale of  and on going services provided for  in flight entertainment systems on other airlines 
we maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry due to the young average age of our fleet  a productive non union workforce  and cost discipline 
in  we plan to continue our focus on cost control while improving the jetblue experience for our customers 
the largest components of our operating expenses are aircraft fuel and related taxes and salaries  wages and benefits provided to our crewmembers 
unlike most airlines  we have a policy of not furloughing crewmembers during economic downturns and a non union workforce  which we believe provides us with more flexibility and allows us to be more productive 
the price and availability of aircraft fuel  which is our single largest operating expense  are extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict 
sales and marketing expenses include advertising  fees paid to credit card companies  and commissions paid for our participation in gdss and otas 
our distribution costs tend to be lower than those of most other airlines on a per unit basis because the majority of our customers book directly through our website or our agents 
maintenance materials and repairs are expensed when incurred unless covered by a third party services contract 
because the average age of our aircraft is years  all of our aircraft currently require less 
table of contents maintenance than they will in the future 
our maintenance costs will increase significantly  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs  as our fleet ages 
other operating expenses consist of purchased services including expenses related to fueling  ground handling  skycap  security and janitorial services  insurance  personnel expenses  cost of goods sold to other airlines by livetv  professional fees  passenger refreshments  supplies  bad debts  communication costs  gains on aircraft sales and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes 
during we experienced lower fuel prices than we did in  helping to offset the weaker demand environment for air travel 
in the fourth quarter of  we effectively exited a majority of our fuel hedges then outstanding and prepaid a portion of our liability thereby limiting our exposure to additional cash collateral requirements 
as a result  we benefited from the lower fuel prices in in the second and third quarters of  fuel prices began to rise although they remain much lower than the record high prices of in response  we began to rebuild our fuel hedge portfolio by entering into a variety of fuel hedge contracts covering a portion of our consumption in the fourth quarter through the first half of in total  we effectively hedged of our total fuel consumption 
as of december   we had outstanding fuel hedge contracts covering approximately of our forecasted consumption for the first quarter of  for the full year  and for the first half of additionally  in january we entered into a jet fuel swap agreement covering another of our total forecasted consumption 
we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and take advantage of fuel hedging opportunities in order to mitigate our liquidity exposure and provide some protection against significant volatility and increases in fuel prices 
the airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the us  with taxes and fees accounting for approximately of the total fare charged to a customer 
airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer 
additionally  if the tsa changes the way the aviation security infrastructure fee is assessed  our security costs may be higher 
the airline industry has been intensely competitive in recent years due in part to persistently high fuel prices and the adverse financial condition of many of the domestic airlines  leading to significant consolidation  bankruptcies and liquidation in recent years 
in numerous smaller airlines around the world ceased operations and other larger international carriers faced bankruptcy 
at the same time  the merger of delta and northwest created the world s largest airline 
we continue to focus on maintaining adequate liquidity 
in june  we successfully accessed the capital markets raising net proceeds of approximately million through a million convertible debt financing and a million common stock offering 
in october  we entered into an agreement with citigroup global markets  inc under which they agreed to purchase our auction rate securities  or ars  which had a par value of approximately million  for approximately million 
we also had approximately million in collateral posted for our fuel hedges as of december  returned to us during our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity 
we have manageable scheduled debt maturities in totaling approximately million  which we believe will enable us to achieve this liquidity goal 
our ability to be profitable in this competitive environment depends on  among other things  operating at costs equal to or lower than those of our competitors  continuing to provide high quality customer service and maintaining adequate liquidity levels 
although we have been able to raise capital and continue to grow  the highly competitive nature of the airline industry and the impact of the current economic conditions could prevent us from attaining the passenger traffic or yields required to be profitable in new and existing markets 
the highest levels of traffic and revenue on our routes to and from florida are generally realized from october through april and on our routes to and from the western united states in the summer 
our visiting friends and relatives or vfr markets continue to complement our leisure driven markets from both a seasonal and day of week perspective 
many of our areas of operations in the northeast experience bad weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with de icing aircraft  cancelled flights and accommodating displaced customers 
our florida and caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes 
as we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses to our entry by other airlines 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  this seasonality may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter 

table of contents outlook for our focus in will continue to be on seeking to achieve positive free cash flow and long term sustainable growth through managing capital expenditures  disciplined cost control and unit revenue optimization while continuing to manage risk in an uncertain and volatile economic environment 
we expect the benefits of slower growth we began to see in will continue through we will  nevertheless  continue to rationalize capacity to take advantage of market opportunities  including potential further increases in our caribbean presence 
in addition  we continuously look to expand our other ancillary revenue opportunities 
in addition to the economic pressures facing the entire industry  we have two major operational obstacles that will challenge us in the first half of first  the ongoing implementation of our new integrated customer service system 
the integrated system  when fully implemented  will increase our capabilities including growing our current business  improving the overall customer experience and enhancing the jetblue brand 
however  we will continue to work through implementation issues and incur one time implementation costs in the weeks and months following our initial implementation in late january second  the impact of the four month closure of the largest runway at jfk  our home base of operations  beginning in march is unknown 
while we have planned for this closure and have undertaken efforts to mitigate the impact  including reduced flights schedules and redeploying capacity  we do anticipate some operational challenges during this period 
for the full year  we expect our operating capacity to increase approximately to over with the addition of four new embraer aircraft to our operating fleet  most of which will be deployed in our caribbean markets 
revenue per available seat mile  or rasm  is expected to improve between and over  which reflects the maturation of markets we previously opened and some improved capabilities in the later part of the year associated with our new customer service system 
assuming fuel prices of per gallon  including fuel taxes and net of effective hedges  our cost per available seat mile for is expected to increase by to over this expected increase is a result of higher salaries and wages due to the pilot wage increases implemented in june of  higher maintenance costs and the costs associated with transitioning to our new customer service system 
results of operations unfavorable economic conditions contributed to the continued weakened demand for domestic leisure and business air travel 
throughout  many airlines were aggressive with fare sales  particularly during off peak travel periods  which further pressured an already challenging pricing environment 
however  we are encouraged going into as these fare sales appear to be tapering down 
we continue to closely monitor consumer demand in order to promptly respond to changes in the demand environment as a result of continued volatility and economic uncertainty 
domestic airlines have largely responded to the economic environment and softening demand by offering fare sales and redeploying capacity and reducing overall capacity 
in an effort to increase demand during low travel periods and attract new customers  we launched our all you can jet pass promotion in september offering unlimited travel for one month for a fixed fee 
in response to the uncertain economic conditions  throughout  we focused on cost discipline  careful management of our fleet and capacity  and maintaining a strong liquidity position 
average fares for the year decreased over to while load factor declined points to from the full year our on time performance  defined by the dot as arrivals within minutes of schedule  was in compared to in we continued to see improvement in our on time performance throughout the year and on a year over year basis  however  we continued to be affected by the fact that a significant percentage of our flights operate out of three of the most congested and delay prone airports in the us year compared to year we reported net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in in  we had operating income of million  an increase of million over  and our operating margin of  up points from diluted earnings per share were for compared to diluted loss per share of for 
table of contents operating revenues 
operating revenues decreased  or million  primarily due to a decrease in passenger revenues 
the million decrease in passenger revenues was attributable to a decrease in yield over and a point decrease in load factor on relatively flat capacity offset by increases in fees from our even more legroom optional upgrade product  which we introduced in mid other revenues increased  or million  primarily due to higher excess baggage revenue of million resulting from the introduction of the second checked bag fee in june and increased rates for these and other ancillary services during other revenue also increased due to additional livetv third party revenues as a result of additional third party aircraft installations  and higher concession revenues from our new terminal at jfk  partially offset by a reduction in charter revenue 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased  or million  primarily due to lower fuel prices  partially offset by increased salaries  wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  maintenance and variable costs 
in operating expenses were offset by million in gains on the sale of aircraft compared to million in gains on the sale of aircraft in while we had on average eight additional average aircraft in service in  operating capacity increased less than to billion available seat miles in due to shorter stage lengths as a result of shifting capacity from transcontinental flying to shorter haul 
operating expenses per available seat mile decreased to cents 
excluding fuel  our cost per available seat mile increased in in detail  operating costs per available seat mile were percent changes are based on unrounded numbers year ended december  percent change in cents operating expenses aircraft fuel and related taxes salaries  wages and benefits landing fees and other rents depreciation and amortization aircraft rent sales and marketing maintenance materials and repairs other operating expenses total operating expenses in  our average aircraft utilization declined to hours per day 
a lower aircraft utilization results in fewer available seat miles and  therefore  higher unit costs 
we estimate that a significant portion of the year over year increase in our total cost per available mile  excluding fuel  was attributable to the decrease in our aircraft utilization and also was a significant factor of the increase in each component 
aircraft fuel expense decreased  or million  due to a decrease in average fuel cost per gallon  or million after the impact of fuel hedging  offset by two million more gallons of aircraft fuel consumed  resulting in million of higher fuel expense 
we recorded million in fuel hedge losses during versus million in fuel hedge gains during our average fuel cost per gallon was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our fuel costs represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
based on our expected fuel volume for  a per gallon increase in the cost of aircraft fuel would increase our annual fuel expense by approximately million 
cost per available seat mile decreased primarily due to the decrease in fuel prices 
salaries  wages and benefits increased  or million  due primarily to increases in pilot pay and related benefits and an increase in average full time equivalent employees 
the increase in average full time equivalent employees is partially driven by our policy of not furloughing employees and additional staffing levels in preparation for our new customer service system implementation in january cost per available seat mile increased primarily due to increased average wages

depreciation and amortization increased  or million  primarily due to million in amortization associated with terminal  which we began operating from in october  and million related to an average of owned and capital leased aircraft in compared to in this increase was offset by an million asset write off related to a temporary terminal facility at jfk in cost per available seat mile was higher due to the amortization associated with terminal and having on average eight additional owned operating aircraft 
aircraft rent decreased  or million  primarily due to lower rates in effect on our aircraft under operating leases in compared to cost per available seat mile decreased due to these lower rates 
sales and marketing expense remained relatively flat 
credit card fees were million lower as a result of decreased passenger revenues  offset by million in higher advertising costs and million in higher commissions in related to our increased participation in gdss and otas 
maintenance materials and repairs increased  or million  due to eight more average operating aircraft in compared to and the gradual aging of our fleet 
the average age of our fleet increased to years as of december  compared to years as of december  maintenance expense is expected to increase significantly as our fleet ages  resulting in the need for additional repairs over time 
cost per available seat mile increased primarily due to the gradual aging of our fleet 
other operating expenses increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in variable costs associated with more departures versus  operating out of eight additional cities in  and increased costs due to preparations for our implementation of our new customer service system in january other operating expenses include the impact of million and million in gains on sales of aircraft in and  respectively 
other operating expenses were further offset in by million for certain tax incentives compared to million in cost per available seat mile increased due primarily to increased departures and new stations 
other income expense 
interest expense decreased  or million  primarily due to lower interest rates and debt repayments  totaling approximately million  offset by additional financing including nine new aircraft and the issuance in of our convertible debentures  resulting in million of additional interest expense 
interest expense in included the impact of million of make whole payments from escrow in connection with the partial conversion of a portion of our convertible debentures due we incurred million of interest expense in related to t  compared to million in prior to the completion of the project in october  we had capitalized million of the interest expense 
the remainder of the decrease in capitalized interest was due to lower average outstanding pre delivery deposits and lower interest rates 
interest income and other increased  or million  primarily due to a million loss related to our auction rate securities in additionally  interest rates earned on investments were much lower in  resulting in million lower interest income 
interest income and other included million and million in gains on the extinguishment of debt in and  respectively 
derivative instruments not qualifying for cash flow hedges in resulted in a loss of million  compared to a million gain in additionally  accounting ineffectiveness on crude  heating oil  and jet fuel derivatives classified as cash flow hedges resulted in a gain of million in both and we are unable to predict what the amount of ineffectiveness will be related to these instruments  or the potential loss of hedge accounting which is determined on a derivative by derivative basis  due to the volatility in the forward markets for these commodities 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in  mainly due to the nondeductibility of million related to our ars impairment in our effective tax rate differs from the statutory income

operating revenues increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the million increase in passenger revenues was attributable to a increase in yield due to a higher average fare offset by a slightly lower load factor 
passenger revenues were also higher due to a increase in departures 
included in passenger revenues are the fees collected from passengers related to our eml product upgrade introduced in other revenue increased  or million  primarily due to higher change fees and excess baggage fees of million resulting from more passengers  the introduction of the second checked bag fee in  and increased change fee rates 
other revenue also increased due to higher livetv third party revenues  rental income  mail revenues  in flight sales  and the marketing component of trueblue pint sales

during the third quarter  we recorded million in the gain on extinguishment of debt 
excludes results of operations and employees of livetv  llc  which are unrelated to our airline operations and are immaterial to our consolidated operating results 
although we have recently faced a difficult revenue environment amid an uncertain economy  we do not expect this trend of declining revenues to continue 
we expect our expenses to continue to increase significantly as we acquire additional aircraft  as our fleet ages and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets and enter into new markets 
accordingly  the comparison of the financial data for the quarterly periods presented may not be meaningful 
in addition  we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of various factors  many of which are outside our control 
consequently  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance

other than one line of credit  which is secured by ars held by us  and our short term aircraft predelivery deposit facility  substantially all of our property and equipment is encumbered 
we typically finance our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing 
at december   we operated a fleet of aircraft  of which were financed under operating leases  four were financed under capital leases and all but one of the remaining were financed by secured debt 
we have received committed financing for the four aircraft scheduled for delivery in although we believe that debt and or lease financing should be available for our remaining aircraft deliveries  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us  if at all 
while these financings may or may not result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet  our fixed costs will increase significantly regardless of the financing method ultimately chosen 
to the extent we cannot secure financing  we may be required to further modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs 
working capital 
we had working capital of million at december   compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  our working capital includes the fair value of our short term fuel hedge derivatives  which was an asset of million at december  and a liability of million at december  we had reduced our december  liability associated with these instruments by posting million in cash collateral with our counterparties 
also contributing to our working capital is the classification of our million of ars as short term assets at december  all of our ars held at december  were classified as long term 
at december   we had million invested in ars  which were included in long term investments 
beginning in february  all of the ars then held by us experienced failed auctions which resulted in us continuing to hold these securities beyond the initial auction reset periods 
all of our ars are collateralized by student loan portfolios substantially all of which are guaranteed by the united states government 
despite the quality of the underlying collateral  the market for ars and other securities has been diminished due to the lack of liquidity experienced in the market since early and expected to be experienced into the future 

table of contents during  various regulatory agencies began investigating the sales and marketing activities of the banks and broker dealers that sold ars  alleging violations of federal and state laws in connection with these activities 
one of the two broker dealers from which we purchased ars announced settlements under which they will repurchase the ars at par at a future date 
as a result of our participation in this settlement agreement  ubs is required to repurchase our ars brokered by them beginning in june in october  we entered into an agreement with citigroup  whereby they repurchased all our outstanding ars issued by them for approximately million 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  investment securities and internally generated funds  supplemented as necessary by financing activities  as they may be available to us 
we expect to continue to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as the volatile fuel prices  the current economic recession and global credit and liquidity crisis  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations our noncancelable contractual obligations at december  include in millions payments due in total thereafter long term debt and capital lease obligations lease commitments flight equipment obligations short term borrowings financing obligations and other total includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates 
amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services 
the interest rates are fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates adjust quarterly or semi annually based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the weighted average maturity of all of our debt was years at december  we are not subject to any financial covenants in any of our debt obligations 
our spare parts pass through certificates issued in november require us to maintain certain non financial collateral coverage ratios  which could require us to provide additional spare parts collateral or redeem some or all of the related equipment notes 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt and lease agreements and of our owned property and equipment was collateralized 
we have operating lease obligations for aircraft with lease terms that expire between and five of these leases have variable rate rent payments that adjust semi annually based on libor 
we also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets  as well as office space and other equipment 
we have approximately million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related lease terms 
including the effects of the amendments to our airbus and embraer purchase agreements  our firm aircraft orders at december  consisted of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery as follows in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  and in we have the right to cancel five firm embraer deliveries in or later  provided no more than two deliveries are canceled in any one year 
in february  we further amended our airbus a purchase agreement  deferring six aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in and to  the effects of which are not reflected above 
we meet our predelivery deposit requirements 
table of contents for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short term borrowing facilities for deposits required six to months prior to delivery 
any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft 
we also have options to acquire additional airbus a aircraft for delivery from through and additional embraer aircraft for delivery from through we can elect to substitute airbus a aircraft or a aircraft for the a aircraft until months prior to the scheduled delivery date for those aircraft not on firm order 
in october  we began operating out of our new terminal at jfk  or terminal  which we had been constructing since november the construction and operation of this facility is governed by a lease agreement that we entered into with the panynj in we are responsible for making various payments under the lease  including ground rents for the new terminal site which began on lease execution in and facility rents that commenced in october upon our occupancy of the new terminal 
the facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the new terminal  subject to annual minimums 
the panynj has reimbursed us for costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease  except for approximately million in leasehold improvements that have been provided by us 
for financial reporting purposes  this project is being accounted for as a financing obligation  with the constructed asset and related liability being reflected on our balance sheets 
minimum ground and facility rents for this terminal totaling billion are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations 
anticipated capital expenditures for facility improvements  spare parts and ground purchases in are projected to be approximately million 
our commitments also include those of livetv  which has several noncancelable long term purchase agreements with its suppliers to provide equipment to be installed on its customers aircraft  including jetblue s aircraft 
we enter into individual employment agreements with each of our faa licensed employees 
each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five year term unless the employee is terminated for cause or the employee elects not to renew it 
pursuant to these agreements  these employees can only be terminated for cause 
in the event of a downturn in our business that would require a reduction in work hours  we are obligated to pay these employees a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits 
as we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits  no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are variable interest entities  as defined by asc  consolidation  none of them require consolidation in our financial statements 
the decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each option and a consideration of additional liquidity requirements 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with operating these aircraft  however  we have not made any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors 
we have determined that we hold a variable interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  certain pass through trusts which are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of new aircraft and certain aircraft spare parts owned by jetblue and held by such pass through trusts 
these pass through trusts maintain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs 
the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates and the spare parts certificates are landesbank hessen th ringen girozentrale and morgan stanley capital services inc the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates are landesbank baden w rttemberg and citibank  na we use a policy provider to provide credit support on our class g and class g floating rate enhanced equipment notes 
the policy provider has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the certificates when due and the payment of principal on the certificates no later than months after the final expected regular distribution date 
the policy provider is mbia insurance corporation a subsidiary of mbia  
table of contents inc 
financial information for the parent company of the policy provider is available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov or at the sec s public reference room in washington  dc we have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our balance sheet which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies  including guarantees and indemnities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financials statements 
we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in addition  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
passenger revenue 
passenger ticket sales are initially deferred in air traffic liability 
the air traffic liability also includes customer credits issued and unused tickets whose travel date has passed 
credit for unused tickets and customer credits can each be applied towards another ticket within months of the original scheduled service or months from the issuance of the customer credit 
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when a ticket or customer credit expires 
we also defer in the air traffic liability  an estimate for customer credits issued in conjunction with the jetblue airways customer bill of rights that are expected to be ultimately redeemed 
these estimates are based on historical experience and are periodically evaluated  and adjusted if necessary  based on actual credit usage 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
in estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in technology 
as our assets are all relatively new and we continue to have positive operating cash flows  we have not identified any significant impairments related to our long lived assets at this time 
share based compensation 
the adoption of asc  compensation stock compensation  in required the recording of stock based compensation expense for issuances under our stock purchase plan and stock incentive plan over their requisite service period using a fair value approach 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards 
the black scholes merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using an implied life derived from the results of a lattice model  which incorporates our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
the expected term of restricted stock units is based on the requisite service period of the awards being granted 
we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock at the grant date using a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of two year publicly traded options on our common stock as of the option grant date 
our decision to use a blend of historical and implied 
table of contents volatility was based upon the volume of actively traded options on our common stock and our belief that historical volatility alone may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
regardless of the method selected  significant judgment is required for some of the valuation variables 
the most significant of these is the volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
the valuation calculation is sensitive to even slight changes in these estimates 
lease accounting 
we operate airport facilities  offices buildings and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments associated with these agreements recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
within the provisions of certain leases there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term and periodic adjustments of lease rates  landing fees  and other charges applicable under such agreements  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations and other adjustments have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight line rent expense or their estimated economic life  whichever is shorter 
had different conclusions been reached with respect to the lease term and related renewal periods  different amounts of amortization and rent expense would have been reported 
derivative instruments used for aircraft fuel 
we utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes 
at december   we had a million asset related to the net fair value of these derivative instruments  the majority of which are not traded on a public exchange 
fair values are assigned based on commodity prices that are provided to us by independent third parties 
when possible  we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  as defined by asc  derivatives and hedging  which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement 
asc is a complex accounting standard and requires that we develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to our fuel hedging program and strategy  statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged ie aircraft fuel on both a historical and prospective basis and cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed  to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction 
this documentation requires that we estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel 
these prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices  such as crude oil and or heating oil  and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities 
historically  our hedges have settled within months  therefore  the deferred gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time 
fair value measurements 
we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements  on january  asc clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
asc also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped  based on significant levels of inputs 
we rely on unobservable level inputs  which are highly subjective  in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  including ars and our interest rate swaps 
we have elected to apply the fair value option under asc  financial instruments  to an agreement with one of our ars broker  to repurchase in  at par 
we recorded an million asset associated with the fair value of this put option  which offsets the million of cumulative impairment on the related ars 
the fair value of the put is determined by comparing the fair value of the related ars  as described above  to their par values and also considers the credit risk associated with the broker 
this put option will be adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair value 
the fair value of the put option is based on unobservable inputs and is therefore classified as level in the hierarchy 
in february and february  we entered into various interest rate swaps  which qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc the fair values of our interest rate swaps were initially based on inputs received from the counterparty 
these values were corroborated by adjusting the active swap indications 
table of contents in quoted markets for similar terms years for the specific terms within our swap agreements 
there was no ineffectiveness relating to these interest rate swaps in since all critical terms continued to match the underlying debt  with all of the unrealized losses being deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our trueblue customer loyalty program  or trueblue  which are consistent with industry practices 
we record a liability  which was million as of december   for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards  including an estimate for partially earned awards 
the estimated cost includes incremental fuel  insurance  passenger food and supplies  and reservation costs 
we adjust this liability  which is included in air traffic liability  based on points earned and redeemed  changes in the estimated incremental costs associated with providing travel and changes in the trueblue program 
in november  we launched an improved version of trueblue  which allows customers to earn points based on the value paid for a trip rather than the length of the trip 
in addition  unlike our original program  the improved version does not result in the automatic generation of a travel award once minimum award levels are reached  but instead the points are maintained in the account until used by the member or until they expire months after the last account activity 
as a result of these changes we expect breakage  or the points that ultimately expire unused  to be substantially reduced 
estimates of breakage for the improved version of trueblue have been made based on a simulation of the improved program rules using our historical data 
as more data is collected by us on our members behaviors in the program  these estimates may change 
periodically  we evaluate our assumptions for appropriateness  including comparison of the cost estimates to actual costs incurred as well as the expiration and redemption assumptions to actual experience 
changes in the minimum award levels or in the lives of the awards would also require us to reevaluate the liability  potentially resulting in a significant impact in the year of change as well as in future years 
points in trueblue can also be sold to participating companies  including credit card and car rental companies 
these sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  with one element representing the travel that will ultimately be provided when the points are redeemed and the other consisting of marketing related activities that we conduct with the participating company 
the fair value of the transportation portion of these point sales is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is provided 
the remaining portion  which is the excess of the total sales proceeds over the estimated fair value of the transportation to be provided  is recognized in other revenue when the points are sold 
deferred revenue for points not redeemed is recognized as revenue when the underlying points expire 
deferred revenue was million at december  historically  expiration of points sold has been minimal  however  with program changes made to trueblue during we recorded million in revenue for point expirations 
our co branded credit card agreement  under which we sell trueblue points as described above  provides for a minimum point sales guarantee  which is to be paid to us throughout the life of the agreement if specified point sales have not been achieved 
through december   we had received million in connection with this guarantee  which is subject to refund in the event that point sales exceed future minimums 
we record revenue related to this guarantee when it is remote that any future service will be provided by us 
during  we recognized approximately million related to this guarantee  leaving million deferred and included in our air traffic liability 
in december  we extended our initial co brand arrangement through item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes to the price of fuel and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
variable rate leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
actual results may differ 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 

table of contents aircraft fuel 
our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
to manage the price risk  we use crude or heating oil option contracts or jet fuel swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel 
based on projected fuel consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  as of december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements 
all hedge contracts existing at december  settle by june  we expect to realize approximately million in gains during currently in other comprehensive income related to our outstanding fuel hedge contracts 
interest 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
the interest rate is fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
if interest rates average higher in than they did during  our interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately million  compared to million for measured as of december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and investment securities balances at december  and fixed rate debt 
on december   our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt had a total estimated fair value of million  based on quoted market prices 
if interest rates were higher than the stated rate  the fair value of this debt would have been million as of december
