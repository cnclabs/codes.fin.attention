item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts in tables are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
we operate two of the most recognized brands in the global vehicle rental industry through avis rent a car system  llc and budget rent a car system  inc we provide car and truck rentals and ancillary services to businesses and consumers in the united states and internationally 
we operate in the following business segments domestic car rental provides car rentals and ancillary products and services in the united states 
international car rental provides vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services primarily in argentina  australia  canada  new zealand  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
truck rental provides truck rentals and related services to consumers and light commercial users in the united states 
our revenues are derived principally from car and truck rentals in our company owned operations and include i time and mileage t m fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals  ii reimbursement from our customers for certain operating expenses we incur  including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees  as well as airport concession fees  which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations  and iii sales of loss damage waivers and insurance and rentals of navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals 
we also earn royalty revenue from our franchisees in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions 
car rental volumes are closely associated with the travel industry  particularly airline passenger volumes  or enplanements 
because we operate primarily in the united states and generate a significant portion of our revenue from our on airport operations  we expect that our ability to generate revenue growth will be somewhat dependent on increases in domestic enplanements 
we have also experienced significant per unit fleet cost increases over the last five years  which have negatively impacted our margins 
accordingly  our ability to achieve profit margins consistent with prior periods remains dependent on our ability to successfully manage our costs and to implement changes in our pricing programs 
our vehicle rental operations are seasonal 
historically  the third quarter of the year has been our strongest quarter due to the increased level of leisure travel and household moving activity 
any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during the third quarter could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a partially variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size and  therefore  the cost of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand 
however  certain expenses  such as rent  are fixed and cannot be reduced in response to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
we believe that the following factors  among others  may affect and or have impacted our financial condition and results of operations domestic enplanements  which declined in compared to  difficulty in achieving sustained pricing increases  rising per unit car fleet costs and changes in conditions in the used vehicle marketplace  changes in the financial condition of vehicle manufacturers  
table of contents our strategies to expand in off airport or local vehicle rentals  including insurance replacement rentals  increases in borrowing costs  and decreases in market willingness to purchase  corporate and vehicle related debt  changes in foreign exchange rates  and demand for truck rentals 
we believe that the downturn in the us and worldwide economies in negatively impacted demand for vehicle rental services 
historically  our results of operations have declined during periods of general economic weakness 
if economic conditions in the united states were to weaken further or remain weak  our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted in and beyond 
due to reduced demand for travel services  rising borrowing costs and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the minimum ebitda requirement or maximum coverage ratio requirement and other covenants contained in our senior credit facilities and our asset backed car rental conduit facilities 
failure to comply with such covenants could significantly impact our liquidity if we were unable to obtain an amendment or waiver or were unable to refinance or replace such facilities 
see risk factors risks related to our indebtedness 
there can also be no assurance that results will be indicative of results we will achieve in results of operations discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
we measure performance using the following key operating statistics i rental days  which represents the total number of days or portion thereof a vehicle was rented  and ii t m revenue per rental day  which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers 
our car rental operating statistics rental days and t m revenue per rental day are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a hour period 
we believe that this methodology  while conservative  provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business 
our calculation may not be comparable to other companies calculation of similarly titled statistics 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which we define as income from continuing operations before non vehicle related depreciation and amortization  any impairment charge  non vehicle related interest and income taxes 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

year ended december  our consolidated results of operations comprised the following year ended december  change net revenues total expenses loss before income taxes benefit from for income taxes net loss 
table of contents during  our net revenues decreased million principally due to i a decrease in t m revenue in our car rental operations  resulting primarily from a decrease in domestic and international car rental days  partially offset by a increase in t m revenue per rental day  and ii a decrease in ancillary revenues  also resulting from decreased car rental days 
in addition  the total revenue decrease includes a negative impact of million related to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our international operations results into us dollars 
total expenses decreased  million principally due to i a  million decrease in impairment charges  ii a million decrease in direct operating expenses largely resulting from the decrease in car rental days  reduced staffing levels and other cost saving actions  iii million lower vehicle depreciation and lease charges resulting from a decline in our average car rental fleet  partially offset by a increase in per unit fleet costs  and iv a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses mainly related to reduced marketing and commission costs in light of lower rental volumes 
the decrease in total expenses includes a positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates of million and also reflects numerous actions taken in late and throughout to reduce both volume related and non volume related expenses

table of contents the revenue decrease of million was comprised of a million decrease in t m revenue and a million decrease in ancillary revenues 
the decrease in t m revenue was principally the result of a decrease in rental days  partially offset by a year over year increase in t m revenue per rental day 
the million decrease in ancillary revenues was also primarily due to the decline in rental days and reflected i an million decrease in gasoline sales  which was more than offset in ebitda by million of decreased gasoline expense  ii a million decrease in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  which was partially offset by million lower airport concession and vehicle licensing fees remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities  and iii a million decrease in counter sales of insurance  gps rentals and other items although revenues per transaction increased year over year

ebitda reflected a million decrease in operating expenses  including i a million decrease in maintenance and damage  agency operator commissions  shuttling  credit card fees  and other costs amid lower rental volumes  ii a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses related to decreases in marketing and commission expenditures  most of which are volume related  and other items due primarily to management s actions to reduce expenditures  iii an million decrease in employee costs  rents and other expenses related primarily to reduced staffing levels and the closure of unprofitable locations  iv a million decrease in insurance related costs  primarily due to the decrease in rental days  v a million decrease in vehicle interest related to lower fleet levels  and vi a million decrease in restructuring costs 
ebitda also benefited from million of decreased fleet depreciation and lease charges reflecting a decrease in the average size of our domestic rental fleet and a increase in per unit fleet costs 
international car rental revenues and ebitda decreased million and million  respectively  in compared with  primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements and lower demand for car rentals 
the revenue decrease of million was comprised of a million decrease in t m revenue and a million decrease in ancillary revenues 
the total decline in revenue includes a million decrease related to foreign currency exchange rates  impacting t m revenue by million and ancillary revenues by million  and was largely offset in ebitda by the opposite impact of foreign exchange on expenses of million 
the decrease in t m revenue was principally driven by i a decrease in t m revenue per rental day  all of which was due to the negative impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates  and ii a decrease in rental days 
the million decrease in ancillary revenues was primarily due to the decline in rental days and reflected i a million decrease in counter sales of insurance  gps rentals and other items  and ii a million decrease in gasoline sales  which was completely offset in ebitda by lower gasoline costs 
ebitda reflects a million decrease in operating expenses  including i a million decrease in agency operator commissions  maintenance and damage  vehicle licensing  credit card fees and other costs amid lower rental volumes  ii a million decrease in vehicle interest related to lower fleet levels  iii a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses related primarily to decreased marketing and commission expenditures  and iv a million decrease in restructuring costs year over year

truck rental revenues decreased million while ebitda increased million in compared with the revenue decrease was primarily due to a decline of million in t m revenue and a million decrease in ancillary revenues 
the decrease in t m revenue was principally driven by a decrease in 
table of contents rental days and a decrease in t m revenue per rental day in compared with the unfavorable effect of decreased revenue on ebitda was offset by i a decrease of million in operating expenses primarily due to lower volume related expenses and reduced employee costs related to lower staffing levels and ii million less fleet depreciation  interest and lease charges  reflecting lower per unit fleet costs and a decrease in the average size of our truck rental fleet 
corporate and other revenue and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  in compared with ebitda decreased primarily due to i an million charge recorded during third quarter related to an adverse judgment against us in a breach of contract claim filed by a licensee in and ii an million loss representing the company s share of carey s operating results

domestic car rental recorded million of the goodwill impairment  international car rental recorded million and truck rental recorded million 
domestic car rental revenues increased million less than while ebitda decreased million in compared with revenue increased due to growth in ancillary revenues offset by lower car rental pricing 
ebitda margins were negatively impacted year over year by lower car rental pricing  increased fleet costs and severance costs 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in ancillary revenues  offset by a million decrease in t m revenue 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was primarily due to i a million increase in rentals of gps navigation units  our implementation of an energy recovery fee  sales of insurance products and other items  ii a million increase in gasoline sales  which was more than offset in ebitda by million of higher gasoline expense including an unfavorable impact of million from gasoline hedges  and iii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  million of which was offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities 
the decrease in t m revenue was principally driven by a decrease in t m revenue per day  while rental days remained essentially unchanged year over year 
the favorable effect of increased revenues was offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges resulting from an increase in per unit fleet costs  while the average size of our domestic rental fleet decreased 
ebitda also reflected a million increase in operating and selling  general and administrative and other expenses including i million of restructuring charges recorded in primarily due to expenses related to severance and the closure of rental facilities  ii million of incremental operating expenses primarily representing inflationary increases in wages and salaries  off airport rental expense and other costs offset by expense savings from our process improvement and cost reduction initiatives  and iii a million increase in selling  general and administration expense primarily related to higher travel agency commissions  travel incentive programs and other marketing costs 

table of contents international car rental revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with revenue and ebitda increased primarily due to growth in ancillary revenues and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in ancillary revenues and a million increase in car rental t m revenue 
the total growth in revenue includes a million increase related to foreign currency exchange rates  impacting t m revenue by million and ancillary revenues by million  and was largely offset in ebitda by the opposite impact of foreign exchange on expenses of million

the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in rental days  while t m revenue per day remained essentially unchanged year over year 
the favorable effect of incremental t m revenues was offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges  reflecting a increase in the average size of our international rental fleet and a increase in per unit fleet costs 
ebitda also reflects a million increase in incremental operating expenses including i a million increase in salaries and wages  rents and other costs  ii a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense related primarily to increased agency operator commissions  marketing and other expenses  and iii million of restructuring charges recorded in for severance related expenses and costs for facility closures 
these cost increases were offset by a million reduction in insurance costs due to favorable claims experience and a million gain on our foreign exchange earnings hedges

ebitda also reflected a decrease of million in operating commission expense primarily as a result of the decrease in t m revenue  and million of restructuring charges recorded in for severance related expenses 
corporate and other revenue and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  in compared with the revenue decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues earned for information technology and other service contracts with realogy  wyndham and travelport as the contracts expire and various services are no longer required

table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs 
these programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets 
the income generated by these assets is used  in part  to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs 
we believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because  ultimately  the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets

as we discussed above  as of december   we have cash and cash equivalents of million  available letter of credit capacity under our revolving credit facility of million  and available capacity under our vehicle programs of approximately billion 
our liquidity position has been and may be negatively affected by financial market disruptions and the downturn in the us and worldwide economies  which have resulted in and may result in further unfavorable conditions in the vehicle rental industry  in the asset backed financing market  and in the credit markets generally 
we believe these factors have affected and could further affect the debt ratings assigned to us by credit rating agencies and the cost of our borrowings 
additionally  a downturn in the us economy or a disruption in the credit markets could impact our liquidity due to i decreased demand and pricing for vehicles in the used vehicle market  ii increased costs associated with  and or reduced capacity or increased collateral needs under  our financings  iii the adverse impact of vehicle manufacturers  including general motors company  ford motor company  chrysler group llc  hyundai motor america  or kia motors america  being unable or unwilling to honor its obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related program vehicles  iv disruption in our

certain insolvency events by these financial guarantors would result in principal of the related financings being required to be repaid sooner than anticipated 
our liquidity position also may be negatively affected if we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial and other covenants associated with our senior credit facilities and other borrowings

accounting policies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events and or events that are outside of our control 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
in performing this review  we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including the fair market trading price of our common stock and management s projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among three reporting units 
during  there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
in  a  million charge was recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill and the impairment of our tradenames assets 
these charges reflect the decline in their fair value below their carrying value  primarily as a result of reduced market valuations for vehicle services and other companies  as well as reduced profit forecasts due to soft economic conditions and increased financing costs 
domestic car rental operations recorded million and international car rental recorded million  for goodwill and tradename impairment  and truck rental recorded million for goodwill impairment 
vehicles 
we present vehicles at cost  net of accumulated depreciation on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record the initial cost of the vehicle net of incentives and allowances from manufactures 
we acquire our rental vehicles either through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs with certain automobile manufacturers or outside of such programs 
for rental vehicles purchased under such programs  we depreciate the vehicles such that the net book value on the date of sale or return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values 
for vehicles acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs  we depreciate based on the vehicles estimated residual market values and their expected dates of disposition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent results of operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
currently the company does not record valuation allowances on the majority of its tax loss carryforwards as there are adequate deferred tax liabilities that could be realized within the carryforward period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other conventional valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  credit spreads of the company and counterparties  volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment  which is performed at least quarterly  involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a

insurance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets include additional liability insurance  personal effects protection insurance  public liability  property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self insured 
we estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents and changes in the ultimate cost per incident

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts  to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our debt 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we also use derivative commodity instruments to manage and reduce the risk of changing unleaded gasoline prices 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
our primary interest rate exposure at december  was interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the australian dollar  canadian dollar and the new zealand dollar 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of unleaded gasoline 
we anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio and interest rate derivative portfolios 
the primary assumption used in this model is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 

table of contents our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december   and market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating income  fair values and cash flows 
we have determined that the impact of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
