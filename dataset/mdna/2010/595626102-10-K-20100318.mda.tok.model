retail operations consist of company operated midas and speedee shops 
real estate activities include the development  ownership and leasing of midas and speedee shops in the us and canada 
supply chain activities include providing value added merchandising services to franchisees in which the company establishes relationships with vendors who distribute products and equipment directly to midas and speedee shops 
point of sale technology operations consist of the ownership  development  sale and leasing of automotive shop management software to midas franchisees and other third party automotive service providers 
outside of north america the company operates on a master franchise basis where the midas and speedee trademarks are licensed to master franchisees that sub franchise midas and speedee shops in their respective territories 
mds management is focused on building shareholder value through the profitable growth of the company 
the three main drivers of profit growth for mds are the refranchising of company operated shops  increasing the shop count through the opening of additional franchised units and increasing comparable shop sales 
these drivers are closely integrated  as the opening of franchises is much easier in an environment where franchised shop sales and profits are growing 

table of contents refranchising company operated shops as of fiscal year end  mds operated company operated midas  speedee and midas speedee co branded shops 
while the company believes that owning and operating some shops is an important element of a successful franchise system  the company has significantly more company operated shops than it needs  and many of these shops were under performing and unprofitable at the time they were acquired 
during fiscal  the company operated shop business generated million in revenues  and generated a million operating loss 
if all of these shops had instead been run by franchisees during  the company would have recorded approximately million of additional royalty income  and the million company operated shop operating loss would have been avoided 
in addition  the company would have received real estate rental income on the locations that are owned by the company  wholesale profit from the sales of products to these shops  and would have been able to reduce corporate overhead 
the company refranchised four shops in fiscal and has increased its efforts to refranchise company operated shops 
the company expects to refranchise a significant number of shops in growing shop count since fiscal  annual midas shop closings have exceeded annual new shop openings 
the annual shop closing rate during this period of approximately is consistent with other mature retail companies  however  the opening rate has lagged 
this reduced opening rate is due to a variety of factors including the increased complexity of the midas shop operating model  a lack of focus on new shop development by the mds management team during many of those years  an over supply of automotive repair centers in general  and a re deployment of capital by mds away from real estate investments 
during this time the company has also diverted many new franchisees that may have opened new shops away from new shop development and instead have helped them buy existing midas shops from existing midas franchisees 
midas is an older franchise system and thus numerous long term franchisees have struggled with the ongoing changes required to adapt to the current automotive aftermarket 
the company has been working diligently to identify those franchisees that are not capable or not willing to adapt to the new environment and has been assisting them in transitioning out of the midas system 
this environment has led many new franchisees to purchase existing midas shops rather than to develop new ones 
this transformation has been underway for some time and midas has averaged approximately shop transitions per year in the past several fiscal years  with most shops transitioned to new franchisees 
the benefits of transitioning midas shops to new franchisees can be seen in the performance of these shops 
sales at shops within the first year after transition have historically far outperformed the sales performance of the broader midas system 
in some cases  the improvement is dramatic with sales rising by more than 
in the next several years the company hopes to accelerate the number of transitions each year and thereby increase the capacity of the midas system as a whole to adapt and thrive in this new business environment 
additionally  the company hopes to significantly increase the number of single shop  owner operator franchisees 
currently  about of midas system shops are owned by single shop franchisees  whereas most speedee system shops are owned and operated by a single franchisee 
mds management strongly believes the automotive service business is often best managed by single shop owners who work the business on a daily basis 
in addition to transitions  the company believes that the re opening of previously operated midas shops and the acquisition conversion of competing automotive repair centers both provide a significant opportunity to grow the north american franchise system 
refranchising of available shop inventory because of its position as both a property owner and lessee of midas and speedee shops  the company regularly has a portfolio of shops that have been previously operated by franchisees and on which the company is not receiving rents or royalties 
in the case of properties that are owned by mds  the company must pay ongoing real estate taxes  utilities  security and upkeep costs until the shops are refranchised 
in the case of shops that are leased from third parties  the company must also pay the third party lease costs 

table of contents as of fiscal year end  the company s available shop inventory consisted of shops  of which were owned by the company and of which were leased from third parties 
during  the company collected an average annual rent amount of  from the locations it leased to franchisees and collected an average of  in royalties from each midas shop in north america 
therefore  the reopening of these available shops has the potential of adding significant revenues and operating profits in the future 
the annual base rent obligation on the shops that are leased from third parties is approximately million 
acquisitions and conversions the us automotive repair industry is highly fragmented 
this is demonstrated by the fact that midas  as one of the largest automotive maintenance and repair providers in the us  has less than of the automotive repair shops in the us despite the increase in the number of vehicles on the road in the us over the last years  the number of automotive service outlets in the us has been in decline 
vehicle complexity and the resulting need for highly skilled technicians  training programs and technologically advanced diagnostic equipment  along with the increased cost of real estate  has caused a net decrease of almost of all automotive repair outlets in the past years 
more recently  automobile dealerships have been closing in record numbers  causing consumers to seek out alternatives 
the company believes that the acquisition of existing automotive repair shops  as well as the conversion of independent repair facilities to the midas  speedee or co brand formats  is the most efficient way to grow the mds system 
furthermore  the company believes that the current economic environment will result in an increase in acquisition and conversion opportunities  as competitors struggle to remain viable during this economic downturn 
growing comparable shop sales mds management believes the key to growing sales in the midas system in north america is to focus on those services that are most critical to the regular maintenance of vehicles brake replacement  fluid replacement and tire replacement 
these services are required of all vehicles at periodic intervals and management believes future success in automotive service requires that a service provider possess expertise  credibility and top of mind awareness in all three categories 
these periodic services will serve as the gateway to forming broader  long term relationships with customers  including factory scheduled maintenance and major repairs 
brakes the midas system has long been a leader in the brake category throughout north america 
the company s strength in brake services dates back nearly years and is backed by the well known midas lifetime guarantee 
brakes are the largest and most profitable service category for the midas system 
brake sales at retail have declined over the past several years  producing a significant drag on overall system sales performance 
the company s efforts to drive retail brake sales starts with ensuring brake product quality across the midas system 
during  the company introduced new mandatory minimum performance standards for midas brake friction to be used by franchisees 
in connection with the improved product quality standards  the company launched its securestop branded brake service  which helps midas differentiate the service provided by midas shops amongst numerous competitors who rely almost exclusively on price 
in  the company changed its promotional brake strategy from national single price point television advertising to a more locally focused advertising approach 
brake service is very competitive on a local level and management believes the move to local advertising provides midas franchisees with greater flexibility in addressing local market conditions 
furthermore  it allows for a more consistent share of voice in brake promotions 
finally  the company is in the process of redefining its selling and operating process for customers in need of brake services 
the new process will focus on establishing greater operating uniformity throughout the midas system  including phone handling  customer interaction  product stocking and the brake inspection process as well as the customer follow up process 
tires in the last five years  midas successfully launched a major retail initiative to significantly expand midas shop sales of tires and related tire services 
in support of this objective  the company formed an alliance with bridgestone firestone to distribute tires directly to midas system shops throughout north america 
as a result  comparable shop sales of tires and related tire services in north america increased significantly in each of the past four years 
despite this multi year success in driving tire sales  tires remain a relatively small component 
table of contents of the midas system s overall sales mix less than in the us and in canada for management believes that achieving a sales mix in tires is both attainable and important to the future growth of the midas system in north america 
the company continues to test a significantly expanded tire program in certain company operated and franchised midas shops 
if this program succeeds  it will serve as a model for shops throughout the midas system 
going forward  the company believes that sales of tires and related tire services will be a significant component of future revenue growth for the midas system 
fluid exchanges in fiscal  the company began the roll out of a series of initiatives designed to build sales in maintenance services as a means to increase repeat customer business 
the program most importantly included the standardization of the midas oil change service and vehicle inspection process  providing all customers with suggested factory maintenance schedules and increasing the midas shop s focus and capabilities in fluid exchange services  which are an increasingly important component of factory scheduled maintenance 
in response to the company s efforts to build maintenance revenues and increase shop visit frequency  comparable shop sales of oil changes in north america have increased in each of the past three years  including a increase in in the us however  revenues from this category still represent less than of us midas system sales  and the typical midas shop performs only about seven oil changes per day 
while oil change revenue and car count have been growing over the past several years  management believes the midas system has the capacity to significantly increase that number by leveraging the operating knowledge of the speedee system and enhancing local marketing efforts 
growth in car count is important to driving sales growth in the midas system 
in support of the above initiatives  the company recently reorganized its field operations staff in order to improve operating execution and increase consistency in the way midas franchisees approach customers 
this new approach  which is being referred to internally as the midas way  will be rolled out to all midas shops in north america during the midas speedee co brand opportunity the company believes the acquisition of speedee provides both the midas and speedee franchise systems with a unique opportunity for growth in the future 
by combining into one location midas expertise in general repairs and strong brand awareness with speedee s strength in executing quick lube and fluid exchanges  the company believes it can create a powerful new format focused on satisfying the needs of time pressed consumers seeking value  excellence and a long term auto service relationship 
the company expects that a midas speedee co brand format shop will see customers much earlier in the lifecycle of their vehicle relative to the typical midas shop and will be more able to convert these vehicles into general repair customers relative to the typical speedee shop as the vehicles age 
the resulting higher unit sales volume may produce a higher return on investment for the franchisee by better leveraging shop overhead expenses 
the company launched its first test of the midas speedee co brand concept with three shops during the third quarter of fiscal all three were existing speedee locations in california that added the midas brand to their shop 
a fourth co branded unit  also in california  opened on a de novo basis in october the initial results have been encouraging 
the three speedee shops that converted to co brand units in california have generated significant comparable shop sales increases since launch  and the shops have far outperformed the speedee only units in the same region 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  these shops  along with the de novo co brand  generated an sales increase  which was on top of the increase achieved in the same quarter one year ago when the new format was launched 
during the full year of fiscal  the original co brand units increased comparable shop sales by compared to a flat sales performance in the speedee shops in california  and a nearly decline in sales for midas shops in california 
based on the success of these shops  the company has begun to offer the co brand opportunity to other speedee franchisees and expects to co brand at least additional speedee locations in 
table of contents during december of  the company began a test of the co brand concept within existing midas shops 
four midas company operated shops in suburban chicago were remodeled to accommodate the operating requirements of the speedee concept 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company remodeled and launched the co brand concept in its company operated shops in san diego  ca 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the shops combined to generate a comparable shop sales increase of  and they more than doubled their average daily car counts 
the ongoing testing of the midas speedee co brand concept encompasses numerous shop formats  and the company expects that such testing will continue into the results of these tests will be critical in determining the issues involved with integrating the speedee model into selected midas locations across the us and canada 
the company expects to co brand at least additional midas locations in as of january   there were shops in north america operating as co brand shops 
mds management believes that while the current economic environment  and the need to develop stronger customer relationships and improve operations execution  pose significant challenges for automotive aftermarket service providers  the potential to succeed has never been greater for those existing franchisees that are willing and able to adapt

the impact of this change is not known at this time 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and availability under the current debt agreement provides sufficient liquidity to finance operations and execute strategic initiatives for at least the next months 
contractual obligations the following table reflects the company s contractual obligations under long term debt and lease agreements as of january  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years short and long term debt capital lease obligations finance lease obligations operating leases other long term obligations total contractual obligations the debt  capital lease obligations and finance lease obligation payments shown above represent principal payments required under those agreements 
additionally  mds is required to make certain interest payments in connection with those obligations 
in addition to the amounts shown above  the company currently has million outstanding on standby letters of credit that expire in 
table of contents additionally  mds is due rental revenue in the amounts shown below under sublease agreements on leased properties and rental agreements on owned properties rental revenue due to midas by period in millions total less than year years years after years rental revenue commitments on leased properties rental revenue commitments on owned properties total rental revenue commitments critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  and the company s recent business transformation process  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of warranty liabilities customers are provided a written warranty from mds on certain midas products purchased from midas shops in north america  namely brake friction  mufflers  shocks and struts 
the warranty will be honored at any midas shop in north america and is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle  but is voided if the vehicle is sold 
the company maintains a warranty accrual to cover the estimated future liability associated with outstanding warranties 
the company determines the estimated value of outstanding warranty claims based on an estimate of the percentage of all warranted products sold and registered in prior periods at retail that are likely to be redeemed  and an estimate of the cost of redemption of each future warranty claim on a current cost basis 
these estimates are computed using actual historical registration and redemption data as well as actual cost information on current redemptions 
the determination of the number of products sold that are likely to be redeemed requires mds to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the relationship of historical warranty claim behavior  warranty claim behavior across product lines and geographical areas  and the impact of changes in consumer behavior on future warranty claims 
a decrease of one percentage point in the estimated percentage of warranted products likely to be redeemed in the us would have the effect of changing the company s january  outstanding us warranty liability by approximately million 
a change in the estimated current cost of warranty redemptions of one dollar would have the effect of changing the outstanding us warranty liability by million 
as of january   the company changed how the midas warranty obligations are funded in the united states 
from june through december  product royalties received from the company s preferred supply chain vendors were recorded as revenue and substantially offset the cost of warranty claims 
beginning in fiscal  the midas warranty program in the united states is funded directly by midas franchisees 
the franchisees are charged a fee for each warranted product sold to customers 
the fee is charged when the warranty is registered with the company 
the fee billed to franchisees is deferred and is recognized as revenue when the actual warranty is redeemed and included in warranty expense 
this fee is intended to cover the company s cost of the new warranty program  thus revenues under this program will match expenses and the new warranty program will have no impact on the results of operations 
in connection with this change  beginning in midas system franchisees in the united states started receiving rebates on their purchases from the company s preferred supply chain vendors and 
table of contents mds no longer receives product royalties on midas franchisee purchases in the united states 
because the company s us supply chain partners are responsible for the warranty of parts during the first months  mds did not begin to record revenues or expenses under the new program until fiscal as of july   the company changed how the midas warranty obligations are funded in canada to match the us program 
as a result  beginning in july midas system franchisees in canada started receiving rebates on their purchases from the company s preferred supply chain vendors and mds no longer receives product royalties on midas franchisee purchases in canada 
because the company s canadian supply chain partners are responsible for the warranty of parts during the first months  mds will not begin to record revenues or expenses under the new canadian program until the third quarter of fiscal as of january   deferred warranty obligations under these new us and canadian programs were million and the warranty liability under the former program was million 
valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees and suppliers  rents and other amounts 
the future collectability of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
recent market conditions have increased the uncertainty in making these estimates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the collectability of these assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where mds becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis 
in addition  the company records receivables from third parties at the time a transaction is completed 
these third party receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  the company assesses the collectibility of these receivables 
pensions the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees 
the company s funding policy for the us plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with asc compensation retirement benefits  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded as pension assets or liabilities is determined by comparing the projected benefit obligation pbo to the fair value of the plan assets 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of unrecognized actuarial gains  losses  and prior service costs  net of tax 
as of january   the company has recorded accrued pension costs as follows in millions fiscal year prepaid pension asset canadian prepaid reserve accrued pension liability accrued pension costs 
table of contents the million valuation reserve pertains to the partial wind up of the canadian salaried defined benefit pension plan 
as per provincial laws  the asset balance in excess of the projected benefit obligation is not an asset of the company 
to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with asc  the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
to determine this rate  the company prepares a detailed analysis of projected future cash flows using the citigroup pension discount curve 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used by year 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligations for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining these rates the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred and is recognized in net periodic pension cost over a five year period 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the expected long term rates used by year 
the company assumed a long term rate of return on pension assets of in fiscal and  and experienced a gain on plan assets of million in fiscal and a loss on plan assets of million in fiscal recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks associated with certain investments held by mds pension plans  which could impact the value of investments  net periodic pension costs and future funding requirements after the date of this filing 
the company s pension plan investments are comprised of bond and equity mutual funds and cash reserves 
the pension plans have no investments in alternative investment vehicles such as private equity funds or hedge funds  nor have the plans ever held such investments 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill the company tests the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is tested more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
the company continually assesses whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or slower growth rates  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis 
in step one  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units 
fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and quoted market prices of comparable businesses 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired for that reporting unit  and no further testing would be necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  the company performs step two 
step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one 
table of contents and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 
the determination of fair value of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  earnings before depreciation and amortization  and capital expenditures forecasts 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in both the us and canada  the reporting unit is defined as retail operations  which consists of both franchised and company operated locations 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  intangible assets  long term prepaid assets and other non current assets 
the company reviews long lived assets held for use for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events that may indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of long lived assets  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the company utilizes a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the business climate  a recent history of operating or cash flow losses  or a current expectation that it is more likely than not likely that a long lived asset will be sold or disposed of in the future 
for impairment testing purposes  the company groups its long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities the asset group 
if the company determines that a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable  it compares the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate to the asset or asset group s carrying value 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  the asset or asset group is not considered impaired 
however  if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets or asset group  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset or asset group and the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
the fair value of the asset or asset group is generally determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk associated with the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes in assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at january  in the event that management determines the company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of january   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state income tax net operating loss carry forwards because the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty involved in determining the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  the future realizability could differ from management estimates at january  
table of contents impact of new accounting standards new accounting pronouncements adopted on october   mds adopted changes issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb to the authoritative hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these changes establish the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the fasb will no longer issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead the fasb will issue accounting standards updates 
accounting standards updates asus will not be authoritative in their own right as they will only serve to update the codification 
these changes and the codification itself do not change gaap 
other than the manner in which new accounting guidance is referenced  the adoption of these changes had no impact on the financial statements 
on july   mds adopted changes issued by the fasb to accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued  otherwise known as subsequent events 
specifically  these changes set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on the financial statements as management already followed a similar approach prior to the adoption of this new guidance 
on july   mds adopted changes issued by the fasb to fair value disclosures of financial instruments 
these changes require a publicly traded company to include disclosures about the fair value of its financial instruments whenever it issues summarized financial information for interim reporting periods 
such disclosures include the fair value of all financial instruments  for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not recognized in the statement of financial position  the related carrying amount of these financial instruments  and the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value 
other than the required disclosures  the adoption of these changes had no impact on the financial statements 
on january   mds adopted changes issued by the fasb to the calculation of earnings per share 
these changes state that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method for all periods presented 
the adoption of these changes requires all prior period earnings per share data that is presented to be adjusted retrospectively 
specifically  mds included  incremental shares in weighted average common shares outstanding calculations for fiscal  with a corresponding decrease in the effect of dilutive stock awards 
mds also was required to include  and  incremental shares in the weighted average common shares outstanding calculations for and fiscal respectively 
these incremental shares had no impact on fiscal basic earnings per share but caused a decrease in basic earnings per share in fiscal and in august  the fasb issued changes to fair value accounting for liabilities 
these changes clarify existing guidance that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  an entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses a quoted price of either a similar liability or a quoted price of an identical or similar liability when traded as an asset  or another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurements  such as an income approach eg  present value technique 
this guidance also states that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability and a quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when 
table of contents no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
these changes became effective for mds on october  the adoption of these changes did not have an impact on the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued changes to employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
these changes provide guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
this guidance is intended to ensure that an employer meets the objectives of the disclosures about plan assets in an employer s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan to provide users of financial statements with an understanding of the following how investment allocation decisions are made  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets  and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
these changes became effective for mds on january  as these changes only require enhanced disclosures  management has determined that the adoption of these changes will not have an impact on the financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements issued in january  the fasb issued new guidance and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the levels within the fair value hierarchy 
separate disclosures are required for transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  and the reasons for the transfers must be disclosed 
in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements  separate disclosures are required for purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis 
mds does not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to materially impact the company 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  in october  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the recognition of revenue for multiple deliverable arrangements 
under the new guidance  revenue will be allocated to the different elements in an arrangement based on relative sales price 
the new guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified for the company s fiscal year which begins on january  in october  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which alters the scope of revenue recognition for software deliverables to exclude items sold that include hardware with software that is essential to its functionality 
the new guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified for the company s fiscal year which begins on january  early adoption of this new guidance is permitted 
the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued changes to the accounting for variable interest entities 
these changes require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  to require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  to eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  to add an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that holders of the equity investment at risk  as a group  lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and to require enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
these changes become effective for mds on january  the adoption of these changes will not have an impact on the company s financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard relating to the accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the new standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and clarifies existing gaap as it relates to determining whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred financial assets 
the standard limits the circumstances in which a financial asset  or portion of a financial asset  should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements presented and or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset 
the standard also requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
it is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november   with early adoption prohibited 
the new standard will be applied prospectively  except for the disclosure requirements  which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the new standard  which is effective for the company as of january   is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this report contains and oral communications made by mds may contain forward looking statements that may be identified by their use of words like plans  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  forecasts  will  outlook should or other words of similar meaning 
all statements that address the company s expectations or projections about the future  including statements about mds s strategy for growth  cost reduction goals  expenditures and financial results  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on the company s estimates  assumptions and expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
mds cannot guarantee that these estimates  assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized 
mds disclaims any intention or obligation other than as required by law to update or revise any forward looking statements 
the company s results of operations and the forward looking statements could be affected by  among others things general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates  economic developments that have a particularly adverse effect on one or more of the markets served by the company  the ability to execute management s internal operating plans  the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures  the company s ability to access debt and equity markets  economic and market conditions in the us and worldwide  currency exchange rates  changes in consumer spending levels and demand for new products and services  and overall competitive activities 
certain of these risks are more fully described in item of part i of this annual report 
the company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency and interest rates 
mds uses a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when considered appropriate  derivative financial instruments 
the company uses derivative financial instruments only for risk management and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
mds is exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
historically  the company s primary exposure is to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
beginning in fiscal  the company became exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro for international license fees from europe that were previously fixed and denominated in us dollars 
interest rate risk is managed through variable rate borrowings in combination with swaps to fixed interest rates on a portion of those borrowings 
the company is exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily accounts receivable 
the company provides credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base 
the company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risk 

table of contents the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the expected maturity dates 
the actual cash flows for each instrument are denominated and presented in us dollar equivalents in millions  which is the company s reporting currency 
expected maturity date there after total fair value long term debt revolving credit facility variable rate average interest rate the fair value of the company s revolving credit facility is determined as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for loans of similar terms and comparable credit risk 
the debt was refinanced on december  and as a consequence the fair value of the debt approximates the notional value of the debt 
in november  million in revolving bank debt was converted from floating rate to fixed rate by locking in libor at for a five year period 
in addition  in march  mds entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to convert an additional million in revolving bank debt from floating rate to a fixed rate by locking in libor at through october as a consequence  currently million of the company s million in revolving bank debt is at fixed rates 
the november and march swap arrangements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have been evaluated to be highly effective 
as a result  the after tax change in the fair value of these swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a gain or loss on derivative financial instruments 
as of january   the fair value of these instruments was a pre tax loss of approximately million 
in january  the company entered into a million forward starting swap to coincide with the end dates of its existing swaps 
as a result of this forward swap transaction  in the period from november through october end of the recently extended bank agreement the company has locked in libor at for million of revolving bank debt 
the company has no firmly committed sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies
