the number of shares utilized in the calculation of diluted loss per share from continuing operations  discontinued operations and net income were the same as those used in the basic calculation of earnings per share for the years ended march    and  as we incurred a loss from continuing operations for each of those periods 
concurrent with the stock split stock split in fiscal year  we modified the outstanding warrants  doubling the number of warrants and reducing the exercise price in half to reflect the stock split 
since the warrant terms did not contain an anti dilution provision  we were required to record share based compensation expense in the amount of million  reflecting the change in the warrants fair value immediately before and after the stock split

overview parlux fragrances  inc is engaged in the business of creating  designing  manufacturing  distributing and selling prestige fragrances and beauty related products marketed primarily through specialty stores  national department stores and perfumeries on a worldwide basis 
the fragrance market is generally divided into a prestige group distributed primarily through department and specialty stores and a mass market group primarily chain drug stores  mass merchandisers  smaller perfumeries and pharmacies 
our fragrance products are positioned primarily in the prestige group 
as a result of the economic downturn over the past two years and the impact of the expiration of the guess license on december   we have incurred significant net losses of million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
net cash used in operations during the year ended march   was million  while net cash provided by operations during the year ended march   was million 
as reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of march   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and positive working capital of million 
during fiscal years and  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives including a targeted reduction in staff  along with a reduction in committed advertising and promotional spending  and reduced our production levels 
the reductions during fiscal year were partially offset by approximately million in advertising and promotional expense relating to the write off of our remaining guess collateral material 
management will continue to implement various operational efficiencies and monitor all facets of our operations 
on february   we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance plus interest and fees under our loan agreement with regions  and the loan agreement  as amended  was terminated 
on june   we entered into the new loan agreement with ge capital 
the new loan agreement provides a credit line of up to million  depending upon the availability of a borrowing base and certain reserves established by ge capital from time to time  at an interest rate of the highest of a the prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus  or c the eurodollar rate  in each case plus  or the eurodollar rate plus  at our option except in certain circumstances including defaults in the payment of any amounts under the loan facility or the unavailability of the libor rate 
the term of the loan facility under the new loan agreement is two years 
see liquidity and capital resources  and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
management believes that the actions taken  along with the new credit facility will provide us an opportunity to improve liquidity and profitability  and our new financing will be sufficient to meet our current operating and seasonal needs 
however  if we were to expand operations through acquisitions  new licensing arrangements or both  we may need to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurances that we could obtain additional financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
in addition  the current business environment may increase the difficulty of obtaining additional financing  if necessary 
we distribute certain brands through perfumania  a specialty retailer of fragrances in the united states and puerto rico  and quality king 
perfumania is a wholly owned subsidiary of perfumania holdings  inc the majority shareholders of perfumania holdings  inc are also the owners of quality king  a privately held  wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and beauty care products 
perfumania is one of our largest customers  and transactions with perfumania are closely monitored by management  and any unusual trends or issues are brought to the attention of our audit committee and board of directors 
during fiscal year  perfumania holdings  inc s majority shareholders acquired an approximate ownership interest in our company at that time at march   and accordingly  transactions with perfumania and quality king are included as related party sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operat ions 
during the year ended march   in addition to sales to perfumania and quality king  we sold a number of our products to jacavi  a fragrance distributor 
jacavi s managing member is rene garcia 
rene garcia owns approximately of the outstanding stock of perfumania holdings  inc as of march   and is one of the principals of artistic brands 
also  on june   certain persons related to mr 
garcia  the garcia group  acquired  shares of our common stock 
the garcia group reports having beneficial ownership of a total of  shares  or approximately of our outstanding shares as of june   excluding warrants owned by the garcia group 
sales to jacavi are also included as related party sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   we engaged in the manufacture through sub contractors  distribution and sale of paris hilton  jessica simpson  queen latifah  marc ecko  josie natori  guess  nicole miller  xoxo  ocean pacific op  andy roddick  and babygund fragrances and grooming items on an exclusive basis as a licensee 
during the fiscal year ended march   we entered into sublicensing agreements for the fragrance licenses of entertainers rihanna and kanye west 
the paris hilton and guess brands of fragrances and accessories accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our gross sales from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended march   and and  respectively  of our gross sales from continuing operations during the year ended march  the guess license expired on december   and was not renewed 
as a result  licensed paris hilton brand products are expected to account for the majority of our gross sales and constitute our primary source of revenue for the year ending march  if paris hilton s appeal as a celebrity were to diminish  it could result in a material reduction in our sales of licensed paris hilton brand products  adversely affecting our results of operations and operating cash flows 
the paris hilton fragrance license is scheduled to expire on june  as of march   the carrying value of our inventories of guess products totaled million million at march  
during the year ended march   we recorded additional charges of million to cost of sales to reduce the recorded value of such inventories to the amounts which we estimate could be realized upon their sale or liquidation 
in addition  during the year ended march   we wrote off approximately million of collateral material related to the guess brand products  which was recorded as advertising and promotional expense 
at december   the end of the license period  guess and or its new fragrance licensee had the option of purchasing the remaining inventory  or the inventory must be destroyed 
the new fragrance licensee is in the process of purchasing the remaining inventory balance at march  we expect to partially offset the reduction in sales of guess products by increased sales of fragrances launched during fiscal years and  including our paris hilton fragrances  fairy dust and siren  jessica simpson fragrances  fancy and fancy love  queen latifah fragrance  queen  josie natori fragrance  natori  and marc ecko fragrance  ecko  as well as sales from anticipated new fragrances under the paris hilton  jessica simpson  queen latifah  marc ecko and nicole miller fragrance licenses in fiscal year in addition  we anticipate launching a new fragrance under our recently signed rihanna sublicense in the spring of fiscal year we expanded our product licenses under the paris hilton brand into the accessory market in  specifically  watches  handbags  purses  small leather goods  cosmetics and sunglasses 
we believed such products  which have similar distribution channels to our fragrance products  could strengthen our position with our current customers and distributors while providing incremental sales volume 
our sales under such accessory licenses have not offset the minimum annual royalties paid to the licensor 
during the year ended march   we sublicensed the international rights for handbags  purses  wallets  and other small leather goods 
we generated million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year in sublicense revenue 
we anticipate minimum revenues of million under this sublicense for fiscal year in addition  during january  we sublicensed th e worldwide exclusive licensing rights for paris hilton sunglasses through january   and remain contingently liable for the minimum guaranteed royalty from our assignment of the license 
we generated million in fiscal year in sublicense revenue and anticipate minimum revenues of million under this sublicense for fiscal year as of march   we determined that the license for paris hilton cosmetics  which is due to expire on january   was no longer a viable business line and all remaining royalty obligations were accrued and expensed in fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for long lived assets 
the majority of our long lived assets are the result of the acquisition of existing license brands 
for newly launched brands our long lived assets are generally the result of our investment in trademarking brand names and designs  and are generally not a material portion of our assets 
the value of our long lived assets  including brand licenses and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
on an annual basis  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment  or sooner  if events or circumstances have occurred that indicate a potential impairment 
impairment losses are recognized if expected undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets are less than their carrying values 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions 
the assumptions used include an analysis by license  and by fragrance produced under each license  which may vary depending on the age of the product 
expected sales along with related costs of sales  direct expenses and certain allocated charges are projected through the end of each given license period 
expected sales estimates incorporate the age of a product and its market distribution 
although certain products may not be widely distributed  we may have certain distribution channels  such as specialty discount stores  where the product is in demand 
direct expenses  including cost of goods and royalties  vary by product  but generally range between to 
allocated charges include selling and distribution costs  marketing expenses and depreciation of molds 
although these costs vary by brand  management anticipates that these costs would range between and 
the net unamortized balance of our trademarks and licenses at march   is approximately million 
management does not anticipate any further ma terial write down will be required going forward  however  if actual results differ from management s estimates  or if the economic environment should deteriorate  additional write downs may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge for the xoxo fragrance license of million in fiscal year the impairment charge is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
our management determined that this asset would be reviewed on a quarterly basis going forward 
as a result of our quarterly review  we determined that there was no further impairment charges recorded during the years ended march   and allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant most of our unrelated us department store customers the right to return a product which does not sell through to consumers 
at the time of sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in our assessment of customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
it is generally after the specific gift giving season mother s day  christmas  etc 
that our customers request approval for the return of unsold items 
we decide to accept returns on a case by case basis 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the provision for returns  and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  if actual returns received exceed estimates  reducing net sales 
all o ther customers have no right to return products unless they are damaged or otherwise 
the allowance for sales returns was million and million at march   and  respectively 
fluctuations in the allowance balance are generally higher after gift giving seasons and are estimated based on a three month period  as it generally takes between two to three months for us to receive such returns 
historically  our estimated allowances have been sufficient to cover the amount of returns subsequently received 
however  an increase in sales returns due to a change in economic conditions  or otherwise  could have a material impact on our operating results 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and million at march   and  respectively 
we continuously monitor the collectability of our receivables by analyzing the aging of our accounts receivable  assessing our customers credit worthiness  and evaluating the impact of the changes in economic conditions 
historically  our estimated allowances have been sufficient to cover our uncollectible receivables 
however  significant changes in the circumstances that affect the collectability of our receivables could have a material impact on our cash flows and operating results 
we have an ongoing relationship with perfumania for almost years 
all activities with perfumania are reported as related party activities  due to certain common stockholders 
management evaluates the credit risk involved  which is determined based on perfumania s reported results and comparable store sales performance 
our management holds discussions with perfumania s management on a regular on going basis in order to monitor their activity 
on an annual basis  as well as quarterly  sales projections to perfumania are reviewed along with a planned payment program  in order to ensure that perfumania s receivable balance is maintained at acceptable levels 
based upon these facts  management believes that no reserves are required for the receivable due from perfumania 
inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
the cost of inventories includes product costs  inbound freight and handling charges  including an allocation of our applicable overhead in an amount of million and million at march   and  respectively 
the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days requires us to maintain at least a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
these lead times are most affected for glass and plastic components orders  as many of our unique designs require the production of molds in addition to the normal production process 
this may take to days  or longer  to receive in stock 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit sku  we frequently produce a six to nine month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
generally gross margins on our products outweigh the potential loss due to out of stock situations  and the additional carrying costs to maintain higher inventory levels 
also  the composition of our inventory at any given point can vary considerably depending on wheth er there is a launch of a new product  or a planned sale of a significant amount of product to one or more of our major distributors 
however  if future sales do not reach forecasted levels  it could result in excess inventories and may cause us to decrease prices to reduce inventory levels 
we classify our inventory into three major categories finished goods  raw materials  and components and packaging materials 
finished goods include items that are ready for sale to our customers  or essentially complete and ready for use in value sets or other special offers 
raw materials consist of fragrance oils or bulk 
components and packaging materials such as bottles  caps  boxes  etc 
are the individual elements used to manufacture our finished goods 
the levels of our inventory maintained vary depending on the age of a brand  its commercial success and market distribution 
we normally carry higher levels of new products and older products for which demand remains high 
older  slower moving products are periodically reviewed  and inventory levels adjusted  based upon expected future sales 
if inventory levels exceed projected demand  our management determines whether a product requires a markdown in order to sell the inventory at discounted prices 
our management also reviews whether there are any excess components which should be marked down or scrapped due to decreased product demand 
our inventories and write downs  by major categories  as of march   and  are as follows march  finished goods components and packaging material raw material total in millions inventories less write downs net inventories n bsp  march  finished goods components and packaging material raw material total in millions inventories less write downs net inventories we perform a review of our inventory on a quarterly basis  unless events or circumstances indicate a need for review more frequently 
the write down of inventory results from the application of an analytical approach that incorporates a comparison of our sales expectations to the amount of inventory on hand 
other qualitative reasons for writing down selected inventory may include  but is not limited to  product expiration  licensor restrictions  damages  and general economic conditions 
as of march   and  of our total inventories of million and million  respectively  management determined that approximately million and million  respectively  of the finished goods inventory was either selling slower than anticipated or showed signs of deterioration 
this inventory was written down by million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
components and packaging materials are reviewed in light of estimated future sales for finished goods or damages sustained during the production of finished goods 
as of march   and  approximately million and million  respectively  were identified as problematic and the inventory was written down by million and million  respectively 
raw materials are usually scrapped due to spoilage or stability issues 
as of march   and  approximately million and million were identified as problematic and the inventory was written down by million and million  respectively 
as of march   our inventories of guess products totaled million million at march  
as our license with guess expired on december   and was not renewed 
we recorded charges of million  which is included in the million write down noted in the table above  as of march   to cost of sales to reduce the recorded value of such inventories to the amounts  which we estimate could be realized upon their sale or liquidation 
we do not anticipate further write downs of the remaining guess inventory 
during the years ended march    and  the carrying value of certain inventory was reduced by million including million relating to guess products  million  and million  respectively  which was recorded in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
based upon this review  management has determined that its inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value  however  if we are not successful in selling our inventory  we may need to write down our inventory further or sell it at significantly reduced prices or we may not be able to sell such inventory at all  which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
demonstration and cooperative advertising allowances 
we record allowances for demonstration chargebacks and cooperative advertising costs 
the demonstration chargebacks are recorded based on demonstration programs with specific us department stores 
the allowance for demonstration chargebacks was million and million at march   and  respectively 
fluctuations in the allowance balance are generally higher after gift giving seasons and are estimated based on a three month period 
cooperative advertising  which is under the direct control of our customer and includes a percentage rebate or deduction based on net sales to the customer  is accrued and recorded as a reduction of net sales at the time of sale 
cooperative advertising with our customers  which is under our direct control  and at our option  including catalogue and other forms of print advertising  are included in advertising and pro motional expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the costs associated with the specific advertisements are recorded as incurred  and when applicable  are applied against trade accounts receivable 
the allowance for cooperative advertising was million and million at march   and  respectively 
historically  our estimated allowances have been sufficient to cover the amount of our chargebacks and cooperative advertising costs 
income taxes and valuation allowance 
if warranted  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination  which such adjustment could be material 
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
in making this assessment  a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
once the recognition threshold is met  the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
in addition  the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
we did not recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or adjust any recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
as of the years ended march   and  there was no material liability for income tax associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not anticipate any material adjustments relating to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months  however  the outcome of tax matters is uncertain and unforeseen results can occur 
stock based compensation 
we recognize the cost of share based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for stock options and warrants granted  based on the fair values of the awards at the date of grant over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes valuation model to determine the compensation expense 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider an analysis of actual option forfeitures  as well as management judgment 
the forfeiture rate used when calculating the value of stock options granted in and was approximately 
since april  we have not made any changes of these critical accounting policies  nor have we made any material changes in any of the critical accounting estimates underlying these accounting policies

significant trends a significant number of new prestige fragrance products continue to be introduced on a worldwide basis 
the beauty industry  in general  is highly competitive and consumer preferences often change rapidly 
the initial appeal of these new fragrances  launched for the most part in us department stores  fuels the growth of our industry 
department stores generally lose sales to the mass market as a product matures 
to counter the effect of lower department store sales  companies introduce new products  which requires additional spending for development and advertising and promotional expenses 
in addition  a number of the new launches are with celebrities either entertainers or athletes  which require substantial royalty commitments and whose careers and or appeal could change drastically  both positively and negatively  based on a single event 
if one or more of our new product introductions is unsuccessful  or the appeal of a celebrity tha t is tied to any of our fragrances or accessory product brands diminishes  it could result in a substantial reduction in profitability and operating cash flows 
certain us department store retailers have consolidated operations resulting in the closing of retail stores  as well as implementing various inventory control initiatives 
the result of these consolidation efforts include lower inventories maintained by the retailers and higher levels of returns after each gift giving holiday season 
store closings  inventory control initiatives  and the current global economic conditions may continue to affect our sales in the short term 
during fiscal years and  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives including a targeted reduction in staff  along with a reduction in committed advertising and promotional spending  and reduced our production levels 
since late  us department store retailers experienced a major reduction in consumer traffic  resulting in decreased sales 
in response  the retailers offered consumers deep discounts on most of their products 
as is customary in the fragrance industry  these discounts were not offered on fragrances and cosmetics 
this resulted in an overall reduction in sales of these products 
historically  as is the case for most fragrance companies  our sales have been influenced by seasonal trends generally related to holiday or gift giving periods 
substantial sales often occur during the final month of each quarter 
this practice assumes activities in future periods will support planned objectives  but there can be no assurance that this will be achieved and future periods may be negatively affected 
in light of the downturn in the global economy  we have performed a quarterly review of our intangible long lived assets during the years ended march   and this review was based upon the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows for the remaining period of each license 
based upon our review  no impairment charges are deemed necessary 
looking forward to fiscal year  our license with guess expired on december   and was not renewed 
we expect to partially offset the reduction in sales of guess products by increased sales of fragrances launched during fiscal years and  including our paris hilton fragrances  fairy dust and siren  jessica simpson fragrances  fancy and fancy love  queen latifah fragrance  queen  josie natori fragrance  natori  and marc ecko fragrance  ecko  as well as sales from anticipated new fragrances under the paris hilton  jessica simpson  queen latifah  marc ecko and nicole miller fragrance licenses in fiscal year we anticipate launching a new fragrance under our recently signed rihanna sublicense in fiscal year it is always difficult to predict sales levels  and is even more difficult in a challenging economic environment 
we continue to take steps to reduce our expenses by reducing employee headcount and advertising expenses  where feasible  as we anticipate launching two newly licensed brands in fiscal year  as compared to three newly licensed brands in fiscal year  and are cautiously optimistic that we are positioned for a profitable fiscal year with our expected product mix and revised cost structure 
results of operations on november   our board of directors approved the sale of the perry ellis fragrance brand license and related assets back to pei 
a definitive agreement was signed on december   and the sale closed shortly thereafter 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
during december  we sold the perry ellis fragrance rights and other related assets to the licensor  perry ellis international 
the results presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended march   includes activity relating to the perry ellis brand as discontinued operations 
for comparison purposes  prior period financial information has been restated accordingly 
our discussions below exclude perry ellis activities  which are addressed separately in the discussion of discontinued operations 
during our fiscal year ended march   we did business with fragrance distributors owned operated by individuals related to ilia lekach  our chairman and ceo through february through june   these sales were included as related party sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of june   mr 
lekach s beneficial ownership interest in our company was approximately 
during the fiscal year ended march   his beneficial ownership declined to less than at march  
accordingly  the company s management determined that  effective as of july   transactions with such parties will no longer be reported as related party transactions  and there were no such sales in fiscal years and during the year ended march   we experienced a decrease in overall sales  as compared to the prior year ended march  the decrease is primarily due to the challenging global economic climate in both our domestic and international markets 
our domestic department store net sales decreased over the prior year  as we experienced larger than expected product returns during this difficult retail climate 
further  the domestic department store retailers have drastically reduced inventory levels due to declining consumer traffic 
our international sales decreased during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   primarily due to a shift in our focus from international to domestic sales 
however  this decrease in overall sales was partially offset by an increase in related party sales 
our overall sales for the current year continued to be negatively affected by the global economic climate 
our license with guess expired on december   and was not renewed 
as of march   our inventories of guess products totaled million million at march  
during the year ended march   we recorded charges of million to cost of sales to reduce the recorded value of such inventories to the amounts which we estimate could be realized upon their sale or liquidation 
in addition  during the year ended march   we wrote off approximately million of collateral material related to the guess brand products  which was recorded as advertising and promotional expense 
at december   the end of the license period  guess and or its new fragrance licensee had the option of purchasing the remaining inventory  or the inventory must be destroyed 
the new fragrance licensee is in the process of purchasing the remaining inventory balance at march  we do not anticipate further write downs of the remaining guess inventory 
during the year ended march   we transferred million of guess brand inventory to its new fragrance licensee at our original cost  as stipulated in our license agreement with guess 
this transfer of inventory  along with the cost of sales and the million of inventory write downs  have been classified as sales expired license and cost of sales expired license in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march  our gross margins may not be comparable to other entities that include all of the costs related to their distribution network in costs of goods sold  since we allocate a portion of these distribution costs to costs of goods sold and include the remaining unallocated amounts as selling and distribution expenses

our ratios and other matters as of march   and  our ratios of the number of days sales in trade receivables and number of days cost of sales in inventory  on an annualized basis  were as follows march  trade receivables unrelated trade receivables related parties inventories calculated on gross trade receivables based on the number of days sales in trade receivables excluding allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and advertising allowances of million and million in and  respectively 
based upon the seasonal nature of our sales to perfumania and quality king  the calculation of number of days sales in trade receivables is based on the actual agings as of march   and  respectively 
the calculation excludes the transition of the remaining guess brand inventory and the trade receivables of its new fragrance licensee as of march  our total net sales during the year ended march   were less than originally anticipated  essentially due to an increase in returns and allowances in our domestic market  as a result of lower consumer traffic during the holiday seasons  and lower than expected international and wholesale sales 
the decrease in the number of days sales in trade receivables in from for unrelated customers was mainly attributable to certain of our larger international distributors paying upon delivery 
management closely monitors the company s activities with all customers  however  if one or more of our major customers were to default on their payables to the company  it would have a material adverse affect on our overall sales and liquidity 
we had net sales of million and million during the year ended march   respectively  to perfumania and to quality king 
during the year ended march   we had net sales of million to perfumania 
the majority shareholders of perfumania holdings  inc are also the owners of quality king  a privately held  wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and beauty care products

the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days requires us to maintain at least a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit sku  we frequently produce a six to nine month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
generally gross margins on our products outweigh the additional carrying costs 
however  if future sales do not reach forecasted levels  it could result in excess inventories and may cause us to decrease prices to reduce inventory levels 
during the current year  the number of days sales in inventory decreased to days from days  mainly the result of the increase in net sales of our new brand products and the sales and write down of slow moving inventories 
inventory balances are generally higher during our first and second quarters due to increased production in anticipation of the upcoming holiday gift giving season 
at the end of the current year  our inventory balances decreased due the launches of our new brand products in fiscal year and the sales of our guess brand products prior to the expiration of our license agreement 
we anticipate that  as new licenses are signed  and new products are launched  our inventory levels will increase in relation to anticipated sales for our existing products  as well as any new products 
the new fragrance licensee is in the process of purchasing the remaining inventory balance at march  we believe that the ca rrying value of our inventory at march   based on current conditions  is stated at the lower of cost or market

the calculation of our fixed charge coverage ratio was measured on a trailing twelve months basis  at the end of each fiscal quarter 
we calculated the ratio as follows a the sum of ebitda  less any non cash gains  less cash taxes paid  less any dividends and distributions if any  to b the sum of the current portion of long term debt cpltd paid during the period plus lease and interest expense
