item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview of oil and gas well drilling and servicing processes oil and gas wells are usually drilled by drilling contractors using a drilling rig 
a bit is attached to the end of a drill stem  which is assembled by the drilling rig and its crew from foot joints of drill pipe and specialized drilling components known as downhole tools 
using the conventional rotary drilling method  the drill stem is turned from the rotary table of the drilling rig by torque applied to the kelly  which is screwed into the top of the drill stem 
increasingly  drilling is performed using a drilling motor  which is attached to the bottom of the drill stem and provides rotational force directly to the bit  rather than such force being supplied by the rotary table 
the use of a drilling motor permits the drilling contractor to drill directionally  including horizontally 
the company sells and rents drilling motors  drill bits  downhole tools and drill pipe through its petroleum services supplies segment 
during drilling  heavy drilling fluids or drilling muds are pumped down the drill stem and forced out through jets in the bit 
the drilling mud returns to the surface through the space between the borehole wall and the drill stem  carrying with it the drill cuttings drilled out by the bit 
the drill cuttings are removed from the mud by a solids control system which can include shakers  centrifuges and other specialized equipment and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner 
the solids control system permits the mud  which is often comprised of expensive chemicals  to be continuously reused and re circulated back into the hole 
through its rig technology segment  the company sells the large mud pumps that are used to pump drilling mud through the drill stem 
through its petroleum services supplies business  the company sells transfer pumps and mud pump consumables  sells and rents solids control equipment  and provides solids control  waste management and drilling fluids services 
many operators internally coat the drill stem to improve its hydraulic efficiency and protect it from corrosive fluids sometimes encountered during drilling  and inspect and assess the integrity of the drill pipe from time to time 
the company provides drill pipe inspection and coating services  and applies hardbanding material to drill pipe to improve its wear characteristics 
these services are provided through the company s petroleum services supplies segment 
additionally  the company s petroleum services supplies segment manufactures and sells drill pipe 
as the hole depth increases  the kelly must be removed frequently so that additional foot joints of drill pipe can be added to the drill stem 
when the bit becomes dull or the equipment at the bottom of the drill stem including the drilling motors otherwise requires servicing  the entire drill stem is pulled out of the hole and disassembled by disconnecting the joints of drill pipe 
these are set aside or racked  the old bit is replaced or service is performed  and the drill stem is reassembled and lowered back into the hole a process called tripping 
during drilling and tripping operations  joints of drill pipe must be screwed together and tightened made up  and loosened and unscrewed spun out 
the company s rig technology business provides drilling equipment to manipulate and maneuver the drill pipe in this manner 
when the hole has reached certain depths  all of the drill pipe is pulled out of the hole and larger diameter pipe known as casing is lowered into the hole and permanently cemented in place in order to protect against collapse and contamination of the hole 
the casing is typically inspected before it is lowered into the hole  a service the company s petroleum services supplies business provides 
the company s rig technology segment manufactures pressure pumping equipment that is used to cement the casing in place 
the raising and lowering of the drill stem while drilling or tripping  and the lowering of casing into the wellbore  is accomplished with the rig s hoisting system 
a conventional hoisting system is a block and tackle mechanism that works within the drilling rig s derrick 
the lifting of this mechanism is performed via a series of pulleys that are attached to the drawworks at the base of the derrick 
the company s rig technology segment sells and installs drawworks and pipe hoisting systems 
during the course of normal drilling operations  the drill stem passes through different geological formations  which exhibit varying pressure characteristics 
if this pressure is not contained  oil  gas and or water would flow out of these formations to the surface 

table of contents the two means of containing these pressures are i primarily the circulation of drilling muds while drilling and ii secondarily the use of blowout preventers should the mud prove inadequate and in an emergency situation 
the company s rig technology group sells and services blowout preventers bops 
drilling muds are carefully designed to exhibit certain qualities that optimize the drilling process 
in addition to containing formation pressure  they must i provide power to the drilling motor  ii carry drilled solids to the surface  iii protect the drilled formations from being damaged  and iv cool the drill bit 
achieving these objectives often requires a formulation specific to a given well and can involve the use of expensive chemicals as well as natural materials such as certain types of clay 
the fluid itself is often oil or more expensive synthetic mud 
given this expense  it is highly desirable to reuse as much of the drilling mud as possible 
solids control equipment such as shale shakers  centrifuges  cuttings dryers  and mud cleaners help accomplish this objective 
the company s petroleum services supplies group rents  sells  operates and services this equipment 
drilling muds are formulated based on expected drilling conditions 
however  as the hole is drilled  the drill stem may encounter a high pressure zone where the mud density is inadequate to maintain sufficient pressure 
should efforts to weight up the mud in order to contain such a pressure kick fail  a blowout could result  whereby reservoir fluids would flow uncontrolled into the well 
to prevent blowouts to the surface of the well  a series of high pressure valves known as blowout preventers are positioned at the top of the well and  when activated  form tight seals that prevent the escape of fluids 
when closed  conventional bops prevent normal rig operations 
therefore  the bops are activated only if drilling mud and normal well control procedures cannot safely contain the pressure 
bops have been designed to contain pressures of up to  psi 
the operations of the rig and the condition of the drilling mud are closely monitored by various sensors  which measure operating parameters such as the weight on the rig s hook  the incidence of pressure kicks  the operation of the drilling mud pumps  etc 
through its rig technology segment  the company sells and rents drilling rig instrumentation packages that perform these monitoring functions 
during the drilling and completion of a well  there exists an ongoing need for various consumables and spare parts 
while most of these items are small  in the aggregate they represent an important element of the process 
since it is impractical for each drilling location to have a full supply of these items  drilling contractors and well service companies tend to rely on third parties to stock and deliver these items 
the company provides this capability through its distribution services segment  which stocks and sells spares and consumables made by third parties  as well as spares and consumables made by the company 
after the well has reached its total depth and the final section of casing has been set  the drilling rig is moved off of the well and the well is prepared to begin producing oil or gas in a process known as well completion 
well completion usually involves installing production tubing concentrically in the casing 
due to the corrosive nature of many produced fluids  production tubing is often inspected and coated  services offered by the company s petroleum services supplies business 
sometimes operators choose to use corrosion resistant composite materials which the company offers through its petroleum services supplies business  or corrosion resistant alloys  or operators sometimes pump fluids into wells to inhibit corrosion 
from time to time  a producing well may undergo workover procedures to extend its life and increase its production rate 
workover rigs are used to disassemble the wellhead  tubing and other completion components of an existing well in order to stimulate or remediate the well 
workover rigs are similar to drilling rigs in their capabilities to handle tubing  but are usually smaller and somewhat less sophisticated 
the company offers a comprehensive range of workover rigs through its rig technology segment 
tubing and sucker rods removed from a well during a well remediation operation are often inspected to determine their suitability to be reused in the well  which is a service the company s petroleum services supplies business provides 
frequently coiled tubing units or wireline units are used to accomplish certain well remediation operations or well completions 
coiled tubing is a recent advancement in petroleum technology consisting of a continuous length of reeled steel tubing which can be injected concentrically into the production tubing all the way to the bottom of most wells 
it permits many operations to be performed without disassembling the production tubing  and without curtailing the production of the well 
wireline winch units are devices that utilize single strand or multi strand wires to perform well remediation operations  such as lowering tools and transmitting data to the surface 
through the rig technology segment  the company sells and rents various types of coiled tubing equipment  and wireline equipment and tools 
the company also manufactures and sells coiled tubing pipe through its petroleum services supplies segment 

table of contents rig technology the company has a long tradition of pioneering innovations in drilling and well servicing equipment which improve the efficiency  safety  and cost of drilling and well servicing operations 
the rig technology segment designs  manufactures and sells a wide variety of top drives  automated pipe handling systems  motion compensation systems  rig controls  bops  handling tools  drawworks  risers  rotary tables  mud pumps  cranes  drilling motors and other drilling equipment for both the onshore and offshore markets 
the rig technology segment also manufactures entire rig packages  both drilling and workover  in addition to well servicing equipment such as coiled tubing units  pressure pumping equipment  and wireline winches 
the rig technology group sells directly to drilling contractors  shipyards and other rig fabricators  well servicing companies  national oil companies  major and independent oil and gas companies  supply stores  and pipe running service providers 
the rig technology segment rents and sells proprietary drilling rig instrumentation packages and control systems which monitor various processes throughout the drilling operation  under the name md totco instrumentation 
demand for its products  several of which are described below  is strongly dependent upon capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors  and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity 
land rig packages 
nov designs  manufactures  assembles  upgrades  and supplies equipment sets to a variety of land drilling rigs  including those specifically designed to operate in harsh environments such as the arctic circle and the desert 
our key land rig product names include the drake rig  ideal rig and rapid rig 
nov s recent rig packages are designed to be safer and fast moving  to utilize ac technology  and to reduce manpower required to operate a rig 
top drives 
the top drive drilling system tds  originally introduced by nov in  significantly alters the traditional drilling process 
the tds rotates the drill stem from its top  rather than by the rotary table  with a large electric motor affixed to rails installed in the derrick that traverses the length of the derrick to the rig floor 
therefore  the tds eliminates the use of the conventional rotary table for drilling 
components of the tds also are used to connect additional joints of drill pipe to the drill stem during drilling operations  enabling drilling with three joints of drill pipe compared to traditionally drilling with one joint of drill pipe 
additionally  the tds facilitates horizontal and extended reach drilling 
drilling motors 
nov has helped lead the application of ac motor technology in the oilfield industry 
we are now transitioning from buying motors from third parties to building them in our own facilities and further developing motor technology  including the introduction of permanent magnet motor technology to the industry 
these permanent magnet motors are being used in top drives  cranes  mud pumps  winches  and drawworks 
rotary equipment 
the alternative to using a tds to rotate the drill stem is to use a rotary table  which rotates the pipe at the floor of the rig 
the rig technology group produces rotary tables as well as kelly bushings and master bushings for most sizes of kellys and makes of rotary tables 
in  nov introduced the rotary support table for use on rigs with a tds 
the rotary support table is used in concert with the tds to completely eliminate the need for the larger conventional rotary table 
pipe handling systems 
pipe racking systems are used to handle drill pipe  casing and tubing on a drilling rig 
vertical pipe racking systems move drill pipe and casing between the well and a storage racking area on the rig floor 
horizontal racking systems are used to handle tubulars while stored horizontally for example  on the pipe deck of an offshore rig and transport tubulars up to the rig floor and into a vertical position for use in the drilling process 
vertical pipe racking systems are used predominantly on offshore rigs and are found on almost all floating rigs 
mechanical vertical pipe racking systems greatly reduce the manual effort involved in pipe handling 
pipe racking systems  introduced by nov in  provide a fully automated mechanism for handling and racking drill pipe during drilling and tripping operations  spinning and torquing drill pipe  and automatic hoisting and racking of disconnected joints of drill pipe 
these functions can be integrated via computer controlled sequencing  and operated by a driller in an environmentally secure cabin 
an important element of this system is the iron roughneck  which was originally introduced by nov in and is an automated device that makes pipe connections on the rig floor and requires less direct involvement of rig floor personnel in potentially dangerous operations 
the automated roughneck is an automated microprocessor controlled version of the iron roughneck 
horizontal pipe transfer systems were introduced by nov in they include the pipe deck machine pdm  which is used to manipulate and move tubulars while stored in a horizontal position  the pipe transfer conveyor ptc  which transports sections of pipe to the rig floor  and a pickup laydown system pls  which raises the pipe to a vertical position for transfer to a vertical racking system 
these components may be employed separately  or incorporated together to form a complete horizontal racking system  known as the pipe transfer system pts 

table of contents pipe handling tools 
the company s pipe handling tools are designed to enhance the safety  efficiency and reliability of pipe handling operations 
many of these tools have provided innovative methods of performing the designated task through mechanization of functions previously performed manually 
the rig technology group manufactures various tools used to grip  tochold  raise  and lower pipe  and in the making up and breaking out of drill pipe  workstrings  casing and production tubulars including spinning wrenches  manual tongs  torque wrenches and kelly spinners 
mud pumps 
mud pumps are high pressure pumps located on the rig that force drilling mud down the drill pipe  through the drill bit  and up the space between the drill pipe and the drilled formation the annulus back to the surface 
these pumps  which generate pressures of up to  psi  must therefore be capable of displacing drilling fluids several thousand feet down and back up the well bore 
the conventional mud pump design  known as the triplex pump  uses three reciprocating pistons oriented horizontally 
recently  nov has introduced the hex pump  which uses six pumping cylinders  versus the three used in the triplex pump 
along with other design features  the greater number of cylinders reduces pulsations or surges and increases the output available from a given footprint 
reduced pulsation is desirable where downhole measurement equipment is being used during the drilling process  as is often the case in directional drilling 
hoisting systems 
hoisting systems are used to raise or lower the drill stem while drilling or tripping  and to lower casing into the wellbore 
the drawworks is the heart of the hoisting system 
it is a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line  which is in turn connected to the drill stem at the top of the derrick 
the drawworks also plays an important role in keeping the weight on the drill bit at a desired level 
this task is particularly challenging on offshore drilling rigs  which are subject to wave motion 
to address this  nov has introduced the active heave drilling ahd drawworks 
the ahd drawworks uses computer controlled motors to compensate for the motion experienced in offshore drilling operations 
cranes 
nov provides a comprehensive range of crane solutions  with purpose built products for all segments of the oil and gas industry as well as many other markets 
the company encompasses a broad collection of brand names with international recognition  and includes a large staff of engineers specializing in the design of cranes and related equipment 
the product range extends from small cargo handling cranes to the world s largest marine cranes 
in all  the company provides over twenty crane product lines that include standard model configurations as well as custom engineered and specialty cranes 
motion compensation systems 
traditionally  motion compensation equipment is located on top of the drilling rig and serves to stabilize the bit on the bottom of the hole  increasing drilling effectiveness of floating offshore rigs by compensating for wave and wind action 
the ahd drawworks  discussed above  was introduced to eliminate weight and improve safety  removing the compensator from the top of the rig and integrating it into the drawworks system 
in addition to the ahd drawworks  nov has introduced an active heave compensation ahc system that goes beyond the capabilities of the ahd drawworks to handle the most severe weather 
additionally  nov tensioning systems provide continuous axial tension to the marine riser pipe larger diameter pipe which connects floating drilling rigs to the well on the ocean floor and guide lines on floating drilling rigs  tension leg platforms and jack up drilling rigs 
blowout preventers 
bops are devices used to seal the space annulus between the drill pipe and the borehole to prevent blowouts uncontrolled flows of formation fluids and gases to the surface 
the rig technology group manufactures a wide array of bops used in various situations 
ram and annular bops are back up devices that are activated only if other techniques for controlling pressure in the wellbore are inadequate 
when closed  these devices prevent normal rig operations 
ram bops seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing rams thick heavy blocks of steel against each other across the wellbore 
specially designed packers seal around specific sizes of pipe in the wellbore  shear pipe in the wellbore or close off an open hole 
annular bops seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing a rubber packing unit around the drill pipe or kelly or by sealing against itself if nothing is in the hole 
nov s pressure control while drilling pcwd bop  introduced in  allows operators to drill at pressures up to  psi without interrupting normal operations  and can act as a normal spherical bop at pressures up to  psi 
in  nov introduced the nxt ram type bop which eliminates door bolts  providing significant weight  rig time  and space savings 
its unique features make subsea operation more efficient through faster ram configuration changes without tripping the bop stack 
in  nov introduced the lxt  which features many of the design elements of the nxt  but is targeted at the land market 
in  the company began commercializing technology related to a continuous circulation device 
this device enables drilling contractors to make and break drill pipe connections without stopping the circulation of drilling fluids  which helps increase drilling efficiency 
derricks and substructures 
drilling activities are carried out from a drilling rig 
a drilling rig consists of one or two derricks  the substructure that supports the derrick s  and the rig package  which consists of the various pieces of equipment discussed above 
the rig technology segment designs  fabricates and services derricks used in both onshore and offshore applications  and substructures used in onshore applications 
the rig technology group also works with shipyards in the fabrication of substructures for offshore drilling rigs 

table of contents instrumentation 
the company s instrumentation business provides drilling rig operators real time measurement and monitoring of critical parameters required to improve rig safety and efficiency 
in  the company introduced its rigsense wellsite information system  which combines leading hardware and software technologies into an integrated drilling rig package 
access of drilling data is provided to offsite locations  enabling company personnel to monitor drilling operations from an office environment  through a secure link 
systems are both sold and rented  and are comprised of hazardous area sensors placed throughout the rig to measure critical drilling parameters  all networked back to a central command station for review  recording and interpretation 
the company offers unique business integration services to directly integrate information into business applications that improves accuracy and assists drilling contractors in managing their drilling business 
reports on drilling activities and processes are now provided from the rig site as a part of the drillsuite business solution to allow contractors to streamline administration by eliminating manual entry of data  promotes accurate payroll processing and invoicing  and includes asset tracking and preventive maintenance management through its rigms solution 
the real time information provided also allows the company to advance the drilling process using advanced drilling algorithms and electronic controls such as our wildcat auto drilling system for better execution of the well plan  enhanced rates of penetration  reduced program costs  and improved wellbore quality 
complementing the company s surface solutions is a portfolio of down hole instrumentation dhi products for both straight hole and directional markets 
key advancements in this area include the introduction of the company s time saving etotco electronic drift recorder  which serves as an electronic equivalent to the traditional mechanical drift tool that the company has offered since coiled tubing equipment 
coiled tubing consists of flexible steel tubing manufactured in a continuous string and spooled on a reel 
it can extend several thousand feet in length and is run in and out of the wellbore at a high rate of speed by a hydraulically operated coiled tubing unit 
a coiled tubing unit is typically mounted on a truck  semi trailer or skid steel frames on which portable tocequipment is mounted to facilitate handling with cranes for offshore use and consists of a hydraulically operated tubing reel or drum  an injector head which pushes or pulls the tubing in or out of the wellbore  and various power and control systems 
coiled tubing is typically used with sophisticated pressure control equipment which permits the operator to perform workover operations on a live well 
the rig technology group manufactures and sells both coiled tubing units and the ancillary pressure control equipment used in these operations 
through its acquisition of rolligon in late  the company enhanced its portfolio by adding additional pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment products 
currently  most coiled tubing units are used in well remediation and completion applications 
the company believes that advances in the manufacturing process of coiled tubing  tubing fatigue protection and the capability to manufacture larger diameter and increased wall thickness coiled tubing strings have resulted in increased uses and applications for coiled tubing products 
for example  some well operators are now using coiled tubing in drilling applications such as slim hole re entries of existing wells 
nov engineered and manufactured the first coiled tubing units built specifically for coiled tubing drilling in generally  the rig technology group supplies customers with the equipment and components necessary to use coiled tubing  which the customers typically purchase separately 
the group s coiled tubing product line consists of coiled tubing units  coiled tubing pressure control equipment  pressure pumping equipment  snubbing units which are units that force tubulars into a well when pressure is contained within the wellbore  nitrogen pumping equipment and cementing  stimulation  fracturing and blending equipment 
wireline equipment 
nov s wireline products include wireline drum units  which consist of a spool or drum of wireline cable  mounted in a mobile vehicle or skid  which works in conjunction with a source of power an engine mounted in the vehicle or within a separate power pack skid 
the wireline drum unit is used to spool wireline cable into or out of a well  in order to perform surveys inside the well  sample fluids from the bottom of the well  retrieve or replace components from inside the well  or to perform other well remediation or survey operations 
the wireline used may be slick line  which is conventional single strand steel cable used to convey tools in or out of the well  or electric line  which contains an imbedded single conductor or multi conductor electrical line which permits communication between the surface and electronic instruments attached to the end of the wireline at the bottom of the well 
wireline units are usually used in conjunction with a variety of other pressure control equipment which permit safe access into wells while they are flowing and under pressure at the surface 
the company engineers and manufactures a broad range of pressure control equipment for wireline operations  including wireline blowout preventers  strippers  packers  lubricators and grease injection units 
additionally  the company makes wireline rigging equipment such as mast trucks

table of contents tubular coating 
the company develops  manufactures and applies its proprietary tubular coatings  known as tube kote coatings  to new and used tubulars 
tubular coatings help prevent corrosion of tubulars by providing a tough plastic shield to isolate steel from corrosive oilfield fluids such as co 
 h 
s and brine 
delaying or preventing corrosion extends the life of existing tubulars  reduces the frequency of well remediation and reduces expensive interruptions in production 
in addition  coatings are designed to increase the fluid flow rate through tubulars by decreasing or eliminating paraffin and scale build up  which can reduce or block oil flow in producing wells 
the smooth inner surfaces of coated tubulars often increase the fluid through put on certain high rate oil and gas wells by reducing friction and turbulence 
the company s reputation for supplying quality internal coatings is an important factor in its business  since the failure of coatings can lead to expensive production delays and premature tubular failure 
in  nov created a owned joint venture in china with the huabei petroleum administration bureau  which coats chinese produced drill pipe using nov s proprietary coatings 
in  the joint venture opened a second coating plant in jiangyin city  china 
in addition to our tk coatings  we also have complementary corrosion control products and services including tk liners  tubowrap  and kc ipc connections 
tk liners are fiberglass reinforced tubes which are inserted into steel line pipe 
this safeguards the pipe against corrosion and extends the life of the pipeline 
in conjunction with the thru kote connection system customers can weld a sleeve for a continuous fiberglass lined pipeline 
tubo wrap is a high performance external coating that protects the pipe during installation and from corrosion once the pipeline is in place 
kc ipc connections use a modified american petroleum institute api coupling to create a gas tight seal that prevents corrosion and turbulence in the critical connections of tubulars while protecting the internal plastic coating at the highly loaded contact points 
tubular inspection 
newly manufactured pipe sometimes contains serious defects that are not detected at the mill 
in addition  pipe can be damaged in transit and during handling prior to use at the well site 
as a result  exploration and production companies often have new tubulars inspected before they are placed in service to reduce the risk of tubular failures during drilling  completion  or production of oil and gas wells 
used tubulars are inspected by the company to detect service induced flaws after the tubulars are removed from operation 
used drill pipe and used tubing inspection programs allow operators to replace defective lengths  thereby prolonging the life of the remaining pipe and saving the customer the cost of unnecessary tubular replacements and expenses related to tubular failures 
tubular inspection services employ all major non destructive inspection techniques  including electromagnetic  ultrasonic  magnetic flux leakage and gamma ray 
these inspection services are provided both by mobile units which work at the wellhead as used tubing is removed from a well  and at fixed site tubular inspection locations 
the group provides an ultrasonic inspection service for detecting potential fatigue cracks in the end area of used drill pipe  the portion of the pipe that traditionally has been the most difficult to inspect 
tubular inspection facilities also offer a wide range of related services  such as api thread inspection  ring and plug gauging  and a complete line of reclamation services necessary to return tubulars to useful service  including tubular cleaning and straightening  hydrostatic testing and re threading 
in addition  the company applies hardbanding material to drill pipe  to enhance its wear characteristics and reduce downhole casing wear as a result of the drilling process 
in  the company introduced its proprietary line of hardbanding material  tcs 
the group also cleans  straightens  inspects and coats sucker rods at facilities throughout the western hemisphere 
additionally  new sucker rods are inspected before they are placed into service  to avoid premature failure  which can cause the oil well operator to have to pull and replace the sucker rod

table of contents drill pipe products 
the company manufactures and sells a variety of drill stem products used for the drilling of oil and gas wells 
the principal products sold by this segment are i drill pipe  ii drill collars and heavyweight drill pipe and iii drill stem accessories including tool joints 
drill pipe is the principal tool  other than the rig  required for the drilling of an oil or gas well 
its primary purpose is to connect the above surface drilling rig to the drill bit 
a drilling rig will typically have an inventory of  to  feet of drill pipe depending on the size and service requirements of the rig 
joints of drill pipe are connected to each other with a welded on tool joint to form what is commonly referred to as the drill string or drill stem 
when a drilling rig is operating  motors mounted on the rig rotate the drill pipe and drill bit 
in addition to connecting the drilling rig to the drill bit  drill pipe provides a mechanism to steer the drill bit and serves as a conduit for drilling fluids and cuttings 
drill pipe is a capital good that can be used for the drilling of multiple wells 
once a well is completed  the drill pipe may be used again and again to drill other wells until the drill pipe becomes damaged or wears out 
in recent years  the depth and complexity of the wells our customers drill  as well as the specifications and requirements of the drill pipe they purchase  have substantially increased 
a majority of the drill pipe we sell is required to meet specifications exceeding minimum api standards 
we offer a broad line of premium drilling products designed for the offshore  international and domestic drilling markets 
our premium drilling products include our proprietary lines of xt and turbotorque tm connections and large diameter drill pipe that delivers hydraulic performance superior to standard sizes 
drill collars are used in the drilling process to place weight on the drill bit for better control and penetration

fiberglass composite tubulars 
when compared to conventional carbon steel and even corrosion resistant alloys  resin impregnated fiberglass and other modern plastic composites often exhibit superior resistance to corrosion 
some producers manage the corrosive fluids sometimes found in oil and gas fields by utilizing composite or fiberglass tubing  casing and line pipe in the operations of their fields 
in  the company acquired fiber glass systems  a leading provider of high pressure fiberglass tubulars used in oilfield applications  to further serve the tubular corrosion prevention needs of its customers 
fiber glass systems has manufactured fiberglass pipe since under the name star  and was the first manufacturer of high pressure fiberglass pipe to be licensed by the api in through acquisitions and investments in technologies  the company has extended its fiberglass and composite tubing offering into industrial and marine applications  in addition to its oilfield market 
coiled tubing 
coiled tubing provides a number of significant functional advantages over the principal alternatives of conventional drill pipe and workover pipe 
coiled tubing allows faster tripping  since the coiled tubing can be reeled quickly on and off a drum and in and out of a wellbore 
in addition  the small size of the coiled tubing unit compared to an average workover rig or drilling rig reduces preparation time at the well site 
coiled tubing permits a variety of workover and other operations to be performed without having to pull the existing production tubing from the well and allows ease of operation in horizontal or highly deviated wells 
thus  operations using coiled tubing can be performed much more quickly and  in many instances  at a significantly lower cost 
finally  use of coiled tubing generally allows continuous production of the well  eliminating the need to temporarily stop the flow of hydrocarbons 
as a result  the economics of a workover are improved because the well can continue to produce hydrocarbons and thus produce revenues while the well treatments are occurring 
continuous production also reduces the risk of formation damage which can 
table of contents occur when the flow of fluids is stopped or isolated 
under normal operating conditions  the coiled tubing string must be replaced every three to four months 
nov designs  manufactures  and sells coiled tubing under the quality tubing brand name at its mill in houston  texas

downhole drilling motors utilize hydraulic horsepower from the drilling fluid pumped down the drill stem to develop torque at the bit 
motors are capable of achieving higher rotary velocities than can generally be achieved using conventional surface rotary equipment 
motors are often used in conjunction with high speed pdc bits to improve rates of penetration 
the nov downhole group also manufactures and sells drilling jars and fishing tools  which are marketed under the griffith tm and bowen brand names 
drilling jars are placed in the drill string  where they can be used to generate a sudden  jarring motion to free the drill string should it become stuck in the wellbore during the drilling process 
this jarring motion is generated using hydraulic and or mechanical force provided at the surface 
in the event that a portion of the drill string becomes stuck and cannot be jarred loose  fishing tools are run into the wellbore on the end of the drill string to retrieve the portion that is stuck 
through its coring services business line  nov downhole offers coring solutions that enable the extraction of actual rock samples from a drilled well bore and allow geologists to examine the formations at the surface 
one of the coring services utilized is nov s unique corion express system which allows the customer to drill and core a well without tripping pipe 
corion express utilizes wireline retrievable drilling and coring elements which allow the system to transform from a drilling assembly to a coring assembly and also to wireline retrieve the geological core 
this capability enables customers to save significant time and expense during the drilling and coring process 
nov downhole offers a wide variety of industry leading technologies to enable customers to enlarge the diameter of a drilled hole below a restriction typically a casing string via its borehole enlargement business line 
borehole enlargement services are typically utilized in deep water drilling where customers wish to maximize the size of each successive casing string in order to preserve a relatively large completion hole size through which to produce hydrocarbons from the reservoir 
borehole enlargement is also employed where customers wish to reduce the fluid velocity and pressure within the well bore annulus to reduce the risk of formation erosion or accidental fracture 
nov borehole enlargement provides bi centered drill bits  expandable reamers marketed under the anderreamer brand name and associated equipment along with well site service technicians who deliver hour support during hole enlargement operations

raw materials the company believes that materials and components used in its servicing and manufacturing operations and purchased for sales are generally available from multiple sources 
the prices paid by the company for its raw materials may be affected by  among other things  energy  steel and other commodity prices  tariffs and duties on imported materials  and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company experienced higher steel prices and greater difficulty securing necessary steel supplies in and than it experienced during the preceding several years 
in and  the price for mild steel and standard grades stabilized while specialty alloy prices continued to rise driven primarily by escalation in the price of the alloying agents 
however  toward the end of  the company began to see price escalations in all grades of steel that continued into during  steel prices stabilized and the company began to experience some declines in steel prices late in and throughout the company has generally been successful in its effort to mitigate the financial impact of higher raw materials costs on its operations by applying surcharges to and adjusting prices on the products it sells 
furthermore  nov continued to expand its supply base in  and throughout the world to address our customers needs 
the steel price declines that nov experienced in later continued through most of in the later part of the rate of decline slowed due to some offsetting pressure from increased costs of alloying agents 
in  nov expects flat to slight increases in steel pricing 
higher prices and lower availability of steel and other raw material the company uses in its business may adversely impact future periods

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference herein 
realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the level of activity in the oil and gas industry  which is volatile 
the oil and gas industry historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for our services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil rigs in operation  the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of these wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions  capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and the level of workover activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures to explore for and produce oil and natural gas and the willingness of oilfield service companies to invest in capital equipment will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control  including the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits  the level of production by non opec countries and worldwide demand for oil and gas  level of production from known reserves  cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  level of drilling activity and drilling rig dayrates  worldwide economic activity  national government political requirements  development of alternate energy sources  and environmental regulations 
if there is a significant reduction in demand for drilling services  in cash flows of drilling contractors  well servicing companies  or production companies or in drilling or well servicing rig utilization rates  then demand for the products and services of the company will decline 
volatile oil and gas prices affect demand for our products 
oil and gas prices have been volatile since in general  oil prices approximated per barrel from through  experienced a decline into the low teens in and  and have generally ranged between per barrel since in  oil prices were extremely volatile oil prices rose to per barrel in july only to fall into the per barrel range in december in  oil prices continued to be volatile  rising from the per barrel range to the per barrel range during the year 
spot gas prices generally ranged between per mmbtu of gas from through then experienced severe spikes into the range in and absent occasional spikes and dips due to imbalances in supply and demand  prices have generally ranged between per mmbtu during in  spot gas prices continued to be volatile  dropping into the per mmbtu range during the year 
expectations for future oil and gas prices cause many shifts in the strategies and expenditure levels of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors  particularly with respect to decisions to purchase major capital equipment of the type we manufacture 
oil and gas prices  which are determined by the marketplace  may fall below a range that is acceptable to our customers  which could reduce demand for our products 

table of contents worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 
events in and constrained credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis 
the slowdown in worldwide economic activity caused by the global recession reduced demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  many of our customers access the credit markets to finance their oil and natural gas drilling activity 
if the recent crisis and recession reduce the availability of credit to our customers  they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures  thereby decreasing demand for our products and services 
any such reduction in spending by our customers could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
there are risks associated with certain contracts for our drilling equipment 
as of december   we had a backlog of approximately billion of drilling equipment to be manufactured  assembled  tested and delivered by our rig technology group 
the following factors  in addition to others not listed  could reduce our margins on these contracts  adversely affect our position in the market or subject us to contractual penalties our failure to adequately estimate costs for making this drilling equipment  our inability to deliver equipment that meets contracted technical requirements  our inability to maintain our quality standards during the design and manufacturing process  our inability to secure parts made by third party vendors at reasonable costs and within required timeframes  unexpected increases in the costs of raw materials  and our inability to manage unexpected delays due to weather  shipyard access  labor shortages or other factors beyond our control 
the company s existing contracts for rig equipment generally carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects and do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience 
however  unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
competition in our industry could ultimately lead to lower revenues and earnings 
the oilfield products and services industry is highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and foreign competitors in each of our current major product lines 
certain of these competitors may have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than us  and may be in a better competitive position 
the following competitive actions can each affect our revenues and earnings price changes  new product and technology introductions  and improvements in availability and delivery 
in addition  certain foreign jurisdictions and government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies or regulations which may give local nationals in these countries competitive advantages 
competition in our industry could lead to lower revenues and earnings 
we have aggressively expanded our businesses and intend to maintain an aggressive growth strategy 
we have aggressively expanded and grown our businesses during the past several years  through acquisitions and investment in internal growth 
we anticipate that we will continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy but we cannot assure you that attractive acquisitions will be available to us at reasonable prices or at all 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own or that our management will be able to manage effectively the increased size of the company or operate any new lines of business 
any inability on the part of management to integrate and manage acquired businesses and their assumed liabilities could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
in addition  we may need to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this financing 
table of contents on terms acceptable to us or at all 
future acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased interest expense  increased financial leverage or decreased operating income for the company  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
our operating results have fluctuated during recent years and these fluctuations may continue 
we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results in the past 
we cannot assure that we will realize earnings growth or that earnings in any particular quarter will not fall short of either a prior fiscal quarter or investors expectations 
the following factors  in addition to others not listed  may affect our quarterly operating results in the future fluctuations in the oil and gas industry  competition  the ability to service the debt obligations of the company  the ability to identify strategic acquisitions at reasonable prices  the ability to manage and control operating costs of the company  fluctuations in political and economic conditions in the united states and abroad  and the ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
there are risks associated with our presence in international markets  including political or economic instability  currency restrictions  and trade and economic sanctions 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from operations outside the united states based on revenue destination 
our foreign operations include significant operations in canada  europe  the middle east  africa  southeast asia  latin america and other international markets 
our revenues and operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries  including uncertain political and economic environments  which may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies  or are subject to governmental policies  giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals 
as a result of these policies  we may rely on joint ventures  license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries 
in addition  political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationships between us and government owned petroleum companies 
our operations outside the united states could also expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations 
the us department of justice doj  the us securities and exchange commission and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trading sanctions laws  the foreign corrupt practices act and other federal statutes 
under trading sanctions laws  the doj may seek to impose modifications to business practices  including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries  and modifications to compliance programs  which may increase compliance costs 
if any of the risks described above materialize  it could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
we have received federal grand jury subpoenas and subsequent inquiries from governmental agencies requesting records related to our compliance with export trade laws and regulations 
we have cooperated fully with agents from the department of justice  the bureau of industry and security  the office of foreign assets control  and us immigration and customs enforcement in responding to the inquiries  and we have conducted our own internal review of this matter 
at the conclusion of our internal review in the fourth quarter of  we identified possible areas of concern and discussed these areas of concern with the relevant agencies 
we are currently negotiating a potential resolution with the agencies involved related to these matters 
we currently anticipate that any administrative fine or penalty agreed to as part of a resolution would be within established accruals  and would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
to the extent a resolution is not negotiated as anticipated  we cannot predict the timing or effect that any resulting government actions may have on our financial position or results of operations 
as a result of our internal review and in an effort to prevent any future compliance issues of this nature  we have reviewed and are in the process of enhancing our compliance procedures and training 

table of contents the results of our operations are subject to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we earn revenues  pay expenses and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar  including the canadian dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling  the norwegian krone and the south korean won 
approximately of our revenue was derived from sales outside the united states 
because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars  we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period 
thus  increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies in which our operations are conducted will affect our revenues and operating income 
because of the geographic diversity of our operations  weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time 
we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net exposure to currency exchange fluctuations 
we had forward contracts with a notional amount of  million with a fair value of million as of december  to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we are also subject to risks that the counterparties to these contracts fail to meet the terms of our foreign currency contracts 
we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates would not affect our financial results 
an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could reduce our earnings 
the company has approximately billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include but are not limited to a significant reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling  a significant reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors  a significant reduction in worldwide well remediation activity  a significant reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies  or a significant increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas 
the timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge  which could be material  would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgment 
if we were to determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets was impaired  we would record an immediate charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction in stockholders equity  resulting in an increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization 
see additional discussion on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in critical accounting estimates of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies that govern environmental protection  zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses 
our businesses are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies governing environmental protection  zoning and other matters 
these laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future 
if existing regulatory requirements change  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
under these circumstances  we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
our businesses expose us to potential environmental liability 
our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment  which could result in personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  or environmental damage and suspension of operations 

table of contents our current and past activities  as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries  could result in our facing substantial environmental  regulatory and other liabilities 
these could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations 
these liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories negligence  strict liability  breach of contract with customers  or as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business  which is normally the case 
we may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental liabilities 
while we maintain liability insurance  this insurance is subject to coverage limits 
in addition  certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination 
we face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies  or the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
even a partially uninsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products 
environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change 
the adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases  including the imposition of fees or taxes  could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
the us congress is currently working on legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  which includes establishing cap and trade programs 
in addition to the pending climate legislation  the us environmental protection agency has proposed regulations that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities  and may issue final rules this year 
these changes in the legal and regulatory environment could reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
the company had revenues of of total revenue from one of its customers for the year ended december  the loss of this customer or a significant reduction in its purchases could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings

kelly bushing a special device placed around the kelly that mates with the kelly flats and fits into the master bushing of the rotary table 
the kelly bushing is designed so that the kelly is free to move up or down through it 
the bottom of the bushing may be shaped to fit the opening in the master bushing or it may have pins that fit into the master bushing 
in either case  when the kelly bushing is inserted into the master bushing and the master bushing is turned  the kelly bushing also turns 
since the kelly bushing fits onto the kelly  the kelly turns  and since the kelly is made up to the drill stem  the drill stem turns 
also called the drive bushing 
kelly spinner a pneumatically operated device mounted on top of the kelly that  when actuated  causes the kelly to turn or spin 
it is useful when the kelly or a joint of pipe attached to it must be spun up  that is  rotated rapidly for being made up 
kick an entry of water  gas  oil  or other formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling 
it occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled 
if prompt action is not taken to control the kick  or kill the well  a blowout may occur 
making up to assemble and join parts to form a complete unit eg  to make up a string of drill pipe

table of contents riser pipe the pipe and special fitting used on floating offshore drilling rigs to established a seal between the top of the wellbore  which is on the ocean floor  and the drilling equipment located above the surface of the water 
a riser pipe serves as a guide for the drill stem from the drilling vessel to the wellhead and as a conductor or drilling fluid from the well to the vessel 
the riser consists of several sections of pipe and includes special devices to compensate for any movement of the drilling rig caused by waves 
also called marine riser pipe  riser joint 
rotary table the principal piece of equipment in the rotary table assembly  a turning device used to impart rotational power to the drill stem while permitting vertical movement of the pipe for rotary drilling 
the master bushing fits inside the opening of the rotary table  it turns the kelly bushing  which permits vertical movement of the kelly while the stem is turning 
rotating blowout preventer rotating head a sealing device used to close off the annular space around the kelly in drilling with pressure at the surface  usually installed above the main blowout preventers 
a rotating head makes it possible to drill ahead even when there is pressure in the annulus that the weight of the drilling fluid is not overcoming  the head prevents the well from blowing out 
it is used mainly in the drilling of formations that have low permeability 
the rate of penetration through such formations is usually rapid 
safety clamps a clamp placed very tightly around a drill collar that is suspended in the rotary table by drill collar slips 
should the slips fail  the clamp is too large to go through the opening in the rotary table and therefore prevents the drill collar string from falling into the hole 
also called drill collar clamp 
shaker see shale shaker shale shaker a piece of drilling rig equipment that uses a vibrating screen to remove cuttings from the circulating fluid in rotary drilling operations 
the size of the openings in the screen should be selected carefully to be the smallest size possible to allow per cent flow of the fluid 
also called a shaker 
slim hole completions slim hole drilling drilling in which the size of the hole is smaller than the conventional hole diameter for a given depth 
this decrease in hole size enables the operator to run smaller casing  thereby lessening the cost of completion 
slips wedge shaped pieces of metal with serrated inserts dies or other gripping elements  such as serrated buttons  that suspend the drill pipe or drill collars in the master bushing of the rotary table when it is necessary to disconnect the drill stem from the kelly or from the top drive unit s drive shaft

table of contents executive summary national oilwell varco produced billion in net income or per fully diluted share in revenues of billion declined five percent from as stated  but declined nine percent when including full year pro forma sales for grant prideco  which the company acquired in april operating profit was billion in  compared to billion in generally was a more challenging year than  as a worldwide recession led to lower demand for oil and gas and lower commodity prices  which led in turn to lower oil and gas drilling activity 
this development negatively affected many of our businesses  but was partly offset by results from our rig technology segment which carried a high level of contracted work into the year  and produced higher year over year revenues 
profitability was adversely affected by intangible asset impairment  transaction  voluntary early retirement and other restructuring charges in that totaled million pre tax or per dilutive share after tax 
excluding these items earnings would have been per diluted share 
for its fourth quarter ended december   national oilwell varco generated earnings of million or per fully diluted share  on revenues of billion 
compared to the fourth quarter of revenue declined percent and net income attributable to the company declined percent 
compared to the third quarter of revenue increased two percent and net income attributable to the company increased two percent 
fourth quarter operating profit was million or percent of sales  compared to million or percent of sales in the third quarter of  and million or percent of sales in the fourth quarter of  excluding transaction and restructuring charges from all periods 
year over year quarterly declines across all segments were a result of lower activity and pricing in most oilfield markets 
the modest sequential improvement in the fourth quarter of was driven by higher sequential activity in north american markets driving better results from the company s petroleum services supplies and distribution services segments  offset by slightly lower results from rig technology 
oil gas equipment and services market worldwide developed economies turned down sharply late in as looming housing related asset write downs at major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis 
major central banks have responded vigorously  but credit and financial markets have not yet fully recovered  and a credit driven worldwide economic recession deepened during the second quarter 
asset and commodity prices  including oil and gas prices  have declined sharply 
after rising steadily for six years to peak at around per barrel earlier in  oil prices collapsed back to average per barrel during the first quarter of  but have been recovering steadily to average per barrel during the fourth quarter of higher oil and gas prices over the past several years led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe by  but activity slowed sharply in with lower oil and gas prices and tightening credit availability 
the count of rigs actively drilling in the us as measured by baker hughes a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending peaked at  rigs in september  but decreased to a low of in june rig count has increased to  in february  and averaged  rigs during the fourth quarter of many oil and gas operators reliant on external financing to fund their drilling programs significantly curtailed their drilling activity earlier in the year  but drilling appears to be recovering across north america as gas prices firmed above per mmbtu the fourth quarter average was per mmbtu 
most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies  which has historically been less susceptible to short term commodity price swings  but the international rig count has exhibited modest declines nonetheless  falling from its september peak of  to in september  but recently climbing back to  in january during the year the company saw its petroleum services supplies and its distribution services margins affected most acutely by a drilling downturn  through both volume and price declines  nevertheless  both of these segments saw prices stabilize and revenues recover modestly from the third quarter to the fourth quarter 
the company s rig technology segment was less impacted through the year owing to its high level of contracted backlog and strong execution during the year 
recent downturns followed an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services between and incremental drilling activity through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments  employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves 
higher utilization of drilling rigs tested the capability of the world s fleet of rigs  much of which is old and of limited capability 
technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built 
the industry invested little during the late s and s on new drilling equipment  but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless  as the company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling 
as a consequence  the safety  reliability  and efficiency of new  modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today 
drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells  more complex wells  highly deviated wells and horizontal wells  tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities 
the drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig  which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement 
this process was accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity 
drilling consumes rigs  more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster 

table of contents the industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since to retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs according to offshore data services  percent of the existing jackup rigs are more than years old  replace older mechanical and dc electric land rigs with improved ac power  electronic controls  automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown technology  and build out additional deepwater floating drilling rigs  including semisubmersibles and drillships  to employ recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins 
we believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency  safety  and capability  and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet  and that declining dayrates may accelerate the retirement of older rigs 
as a result of these trends the company s rig technology segment grew its backlog of capital equipment orders from billion at march   to billion at september  however  as a result of the credit crisis and slowing drilling activity  orders have declined below amounts flowing out of backlog as revenue  causing the backlog to decline to billion at december  the land rig backlog comprised percent  and equipment destined for offshore operations comprised percent of the total backlog as of december  equipment destined for international markets totaled percent of the backlog 
the company believes that its existing contracts for rig equipment are very strong in that they carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects  and generally do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience 
during the company removed million in discontinued orders on cancelled projects and project change orders requested by customers 
we do not expect the credit crisis or softer market to result in additional material cancellation of contracts or abandonment of major projects  however  there can be no assurance that such discontinuance of projects will not occur 
the company had approximately million of projects in its december  backlog that it considers at risk 
segment performance rig technology generated a record billion in revenue and billion in operating profit in  producing operating margins for the segment of percent  excluding transaction and restructuring charges 
the segment generated percent operating profit leverage or flow through the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue period to period on eight percent higher sales as compared to  excluding charges 
revenue out of backlog of billion increased percent from the prior year 
execution of the backlog orders was very strong  which led to higher margin performance for the rig technology segment in the third quarter due to excellent cost control  deflation in certain inputs  greater experience building and commissioning rigs which enables better efficiencies  and somewhat better foreign currency exchange movements 
as a result our estimated costs to complete projects declined steadily through as of december  the scheduled outflow of revenue from backlog is expected to be approximately billion in  and billion for  and billion in from through the current quarter  the segment has delivered over newly built offshore rigs 
aftermarket spare parts and services revenue was billion in or percent of total segment sales 
the balance of rig technology revenues were smaller capital items which the company does not book into its backlog 
these items were adversely affected by lower purchases by many land contractors in view of markedly softer drilling demand during the year 
demand for offshore rigs and equipment is strongest in brazil  owing to significant drilling equipment needs to develop new ultradeepwater discoveries  and the segment also continues to pursue a variety of new offshore rig  intervention vessel  fpso and platform upgrade opportunities in other markets 
however  tight credit markets and fewer committed term contracts for rigs by oil and gas companies as compared to market conditions in are adversely affecting new orders 
demand for land rig and well stimulation equipment has also been very slow  except for the middle east and certain latin american markets  but resumed late in the year in the us additionally  demand for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment for both north america and international markets also recovered late in the year 
the petroleum services supplies segment generated revenues of billion and operating profit of billion or percent of sales in  excluding impairment  transaction and restructuring charges 
revenues declined percent from  when including pro forma revenue for grant prideco  and decremental operating leverage or flow through was percent from  excluding charges  due to a high level of price discounting on most products and services through the year 
prices appeared to stabilize during the fourth quarter of  settling roughly percent below peak pricing levels of although some products and services are at greater  and some at lesser  levels of discounting 
sharply rising north american rig counts led to modestly tightening supplies of many of the segment s products  which contributed to the stabilization 
as working rigs were stacked during their owners tended to cannibalize consumables and smaller capital items from these rather than purchase goods from the company 
during the fourth quarter some of these rigs were restocked with new goods  which led to new orders for the company and benefitted its fourth quarter results in north america 
international demand remained somewhat stable  and did not turn down as sharply earlier in the year as gas driven north american drilling 
drill pipe sales remain challenged due to the large amount of idle drill pipe inventory remaining with drilling contractors 
nevertheless  drill pipe margins have remained good due to lower costs and a positive mix shift toward premium drill pipe  for new offshore rigs being delivered  and for complex horizontal and extended reach drilling programs onshore 
we do not expect drill pipe demand to recover significantly until inventories are depleted through consumption  late in at the earliest 
in total the petroleum services supplies segment generated approximately percent of its sales into north american markets  and percent of its sales into international markets  during 
table of contents the distribution services segment generated total sales of billion in  down percent from sales 
operating profit excluding transaction and restructuring charges was million or percent of sales 
decremental operating leverage or flow through was percent on the million sales decline from the prior year  higher than the segment s historical average  due largely to price discounting in north america  which comprised percent of the segment s revenue in the segment s lower results were driven by a much lower level of drilling activity  which led to intense price pressure and lower volumes for the group 
international results were generally much more stable in as compared to  as higher sales of artificial lift products into latin america helped offset declines elsewhere 
the segment posted percent higher quarterly sequential results in the fourth quarter of as the north american rig count moved up sharply and customers ordered mro supplies for rigs going back to work 
specifically new unconventional shale gas fields in the marcellus  haynesville  bakken and other areas led most of the recovery 
outlook the credit market downturn  global recession  and lower commodity prices presented significant challenges to our business in consequently we remain cautious in our outlook for  but we believe we are seeing signs of stabilization in many of our markets  and are encouraged by limited demand growth in north america seen late in the year 
order levels for new drilling rigs declined significantly in as compared to  but we continue to bid a number of large projects  including up to new offshore floating rigs to be built in brazil 
we are hopeful that these will translate into more orders during the coming year  assuming  among other things  that rig dayrates generally hold up well  that commodity prices remain high  and that broad economic conditions do not deteriorate further 
north american land gas drilling activity  particularly by independent gas producers reliant on external financing  fell sharply early in  but we believe better commodity prices are leading to recovery as we enter our outlook for international markets  which are more driven by national oil company activity and are historically less volatile  remains good owing to high and stable oil price levels established through the second half of our outlook for the company s petroleum services supplies segment and distribution services segment remains closely tied to the rig count  particularly in north america 
if the rig count continues to increase we expect these segments to benefit from higher demand for the services  consumables and capital items they supply 
the rig technology segment was less affected by the downturn during due to the strength of its backlog  but as the backlog has declined we expect to see revenues and margins decline through as well 
on january   the venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation which included a two tier exchange rate system 
the company has net assets employed in venezuela of approximately million  and generated revenue and operating profit of approximately million and million  respectively  in we expect to incur a pre tax charge between million and million in the first quarter of related to the impact of the currency devaluation and changes to social regulations impacting our operations in venezuela 
the company believes it is well positioned to continue to manage through this downturn  and should benefit from its strong balance sheet and capitalization  access to credit  and a high level of contracted orders which are expected to continue to generate earnings in the coming year 
the company has a long history of cost control and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions  and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods 
such a period may present opportunities to the company to effect new organic growth and acquisition initiatives  and we remain hopeful that a downturn will generate new opportunities

the capital equipment backlog was billion at december   a decrease of billion from backlog of billion at december  approximately billion of the current backlog is expected to be delivered in petroleum services supplies revenue from petroleum services supplies was  million for compared to  million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in north american average rig count activity in compared to operating profit from petroleum services supplies was million for compared to  million for  a decrease of million 
operating profit percentage decreased to down from in the decrease was primarily due to reduced north american rig count activity combined with strong price competition 
in addition  a million impairment charge was incurred on the carrying value of a trade name associated with this segment in the second quarter of

non backlog revenue increased million or over  largely due to increased spare parts sales and service revenues related to the increased drilling activity during the year 
operating profit from rig technology was  million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the same period of the increase in operating profit was largely due to the increased activity discussed above as well as improved pricing on large rig contracts and aftermarket products 
the rig technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business 
new orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project 
the capital equipment backlog was billion at december   an increase of billion over backlog of billion at december  petroleum services supplies revenue from petroleum services supplies was  million for compared to  million for  an increase of  million 
the increase was mostly attributable to the acquisition of grant prideco which contributed sales of  million since the acquisition date of april  higher demand for most of the products and services offered by the segment also contributed to the higher revenue compared to rig count in north america and international markets during were up and  respectively  compared to averages  prompting higher demand from our services group 
operating profit from petroleum services supplies was  million for compared to million for  an increase of million 
grant prideco contributed million of operating profit since april  included in the grant prideco operating profit was million of expense recorded in cost of revenue that resulted from the fair value step up of inventory as part of the purchase accounting valuation of grant prideco 
the increase was also attributable to higher profitability across most product lines 

table of contents distribution services revenue from distribution services totaled  million in  an increase of million from the prior period 
the number of drilling rigs actively searching for oil and gas is a key metric for this business segment 
worldwide rig count increased in compared to  with increases of  and in canada  international and the us rig activity  respectively 
the company s distribution services segment continued efforts to expand in international markets resulted in a increase in international revenue 
the expansion primarily consisted of opening rig stores or facilities that maintain levels of consumables used on rigs  in centrally located areas 
in addition  the company has begun to open stores on individual rigs 
after opening its first rig store in  the company opened eight additional stores during continuing the efforts to expand its presence both in the us and internationally 
operating income increased in to million compared to million in margins increased slightly to of revenue in compared to of revenue in the increase in margin was primarily due to the cost reduction actions taken in canada to offset the weakening demand seen in the later part of combined with the increase in profit margins from international locations 
unallocated expenses and eliminations unallocated expenses and eliminations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase in unallocated expenses and eliminations was primarily due to greater inter segment profit eliminations and greater stock based compensation expense 
the stock based compensation expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results also included million of integration costs related to the acquisition of grant prideco 
interest and financial costs interest and financial costs were million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to the borrowings related to the merger with grant prideco

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the rate reflects increasing benefits in the us from the tax incentive for manufacturing activities and a higher percentage of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
this was partially offset by additional tax provisions related to the company s decision to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries during the year and net higher tax expense in norway related to movement in exchange rates after the change of the functional currency to the us dollar 
the net additional tax expense in norway included a million charge resulting from realized foreign exchange gains on us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
this was partially offset by a million benefit for the same period  which was reported as provision for income tax  from the remeasurement into us dollars of foreign currency denominated deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet

for  the company used its cash on hand to fund its acquisitions 

table of contents the effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was a positive million and a negative million in and  respectively 
we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations 
at december   the company had  million of available funds under its revolving credit facility 
we also believe increases in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through existing available debt financing 
a summary of the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december  is as follows in millions payment due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations total debt operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments standby letters of credit as of december   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  impairments of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
revenue recognition under long term construction contracts the company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the rig technology group 
these long term construction contracts include the following characteristics the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications  the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts  and construction projects often have progress payments 

table of contents this method requires the company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project  progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date  all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the company recognizes in each reporting period 
the company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project  taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin 
significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management 
factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access  weather  production efficiencies  availability and costs of labor  materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in risk factors 
these factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the company s estimates and materially impact the company s future reported earnings 
historically  the company s estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts 
based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at december  and  adjustments representing the differences between the estimated and actual results to all outstanding contracts resulted in net changes to gross profit margins of million on billion of outstanding contracts and million on billion of outstanding contracts  respectively 
while the company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at december  and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting  the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods 
the company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts on a contract to date basis of billion at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the company to make judgments regarding future events and trends 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the company s portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends 
this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience  current aging status of the customer accounts  and financial condition of the company s customers 
based on a review of these factors  the company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues come from international oil companies  international shipyards  international oilfield service companies  and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
therefore  the company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate  the creditworthiness of the company s customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables  and additional allowances could be required 
at december  and  allowance for bad debts totaled million and million  or and of gross accounts receivable  respectively 
historically  the company s charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  because of the risk factors mentioned above  changes in our estimates could become material in future periods 
inventory reserves inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand  assumptions about future demand and market conditions  and estimates about potential alternative uses  which are usually limited 
the company s inventory consists of specialized spare parts  work in process  and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the company s large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield 
customers rely on the company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner 
the company s estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity  which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
at december  and  inventory reserves totaled million and million  or and of gross inventory  respectively 
while inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the company s financial results for the periods covered in this report  changes in worldwide oil and gas activity  or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete  could require the company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory 
such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives 
the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
the forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted average cost of capital  both key assumptions used in our calculation 
changes to these assumptions  including  but not limited to further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity  or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
due to further significant declines in the company s stock price and oil and gas commodity prices  coupled with unprecedented turbulence in the credit markets  the company determined a triggering event occurred in the fourth quarter of the company performed an impairment analysis at december  which did not result in an impairment charge 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company has approximately billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include  but not limited to further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity 
the annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year 
based on its analysis  the company did not report any impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended december  and as described below  the company concluded that an indicator of impairment occurred in the second quarter of and updated its impairment testing at june  based on its updated analysis  the company concluded that it did not incur an impairment of goodwill for the period ended june  however  based on the company s indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of  the company concluded that it incurred an impairment charge to certain indefinite lived intangible assets of million at june  the million impairment charge is included in the company s consolidated income statement for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  the worldwide average rig count was  rigs  down from the fourth quarter average of  and down from the first quarter average of  the second quarter average rig count represented the lowest quarterly average in the past six years 
in addition  the company s updated forecast was behind the company s previous forecast completed at the beginning of while operating profit for the first quarter of was in line with the company s first quarter operating profit forecast  the company s consolidated operating profit for the second quarter of was below its second quarter forecast 
as a result of the substantial decline in the worldwide rig count  and the decline in actual forecasted results compared to the original forecast  the company concluded that events or circumstances had occurred indicating that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired as described under accounting standards codification asc topic intangibles goodwill and other 
therefore  the company performed its interim impairment test of goodwill for all its reporting units at the end of the second quarter of the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole 
fair value of the reporting units is determined in accordance with asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures using significant unobservable inputs  or level in the fair value hierarchy 
these inputs are based on internal management estimates  forecasts and judgments  using a combination of three methods discounted cash flow  comparable companies  and representative transactions 
while the company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value  the company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support management s expectations  where possible 

table of contents the discounted cash flow is based on management s short term and long term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit 
the two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment  which bear the risk of change and could impact the company s goodwill impairment analysis  include the cash flow from operations from each of the company s individual business units and the weighted average cost of capital 
the starting point for each of the reporting unit s cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast 
the detailed planning and forecasting process takes into consideration a multitude of factors including worldwide rig activity  inflationary forces  pricing strategies  customer analysis  operational issues  competitor analysis  capital spending requirements  working capital needs  customer needs to replace aging equipment  increased complexity of drilling  new technology  and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections 
cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short term or long term trend 
projections for the remainder of also reflected declines compared to the original annual forecast 
the company updated its operating forecast  long term forecast  and discounted cash flows based on this information 
the goodwill impairment analysis that we performed during the second quarter of did not result in goodwill impairment as of june  other indefinite lived intangible assets  representing trade names management intends to use indefinitely  were valued using significant unobservable inputs level and are tested for impairment using the relief from royalty method  a form of the income approach 
an impairment is measured and recognized based on the amount the book value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds its estimated fair value as of the date of the impairment test 
included in the impairment test are assumptions  for each trade name  regarding the related revenue streams attributable to the trade names which are determined consistent with the forecasting process described above  the royalty rate  and the discount rate applied 
based on the company s indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of  the company incurred an impairment charge of million in the petroleum services supplies segment related to a partial impairment of the company s grant prideco trade name 
the impairment charge was primarily the result of the substantial decline in worldwide rig counts through june  declines in forecasts in rig activity for the remainder of   and compared to rig count forecast at the beginning of and a decline in the revenue forecast for the drill pipe business unit for the remainder of   and during the fourth quarter of  the company further updated its impairment testing using current operating forecasts and discounted cash flows 
in the third and fourth quarters of  both rig activity and commodity prices began to increase 
rig count increased to an average of  in the third quarter and increased another to an average of  in the fourth quarter 
average west texas intermediate crude prices reached in the fourth quarter of  an increase of from an average of in the second quarter of in addition  by the end of the fourth quarter  average natural gas prices increased to  a increase from the second quarter average of 
the impairment analysis that we performed during the fourth quarter of resulted in no impairment of the company s goodwill and no additional impairment for the company s other indefinite lived intangible assets for the year ended december  along with the normal impairment analysis  the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the projected results  the goodwill and the other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis assuming revenue for each individual reporting unit for goodwill and each individual indefinite lived intangible asset decreased an additional from the current projections for  and  while holding all other factors constant and no impairment was identified 
additionally  if the company were to increase its discount rate basis points  while keeping all other assumptions constant  there would be no impairments in any of the goodwill associated with the company s reporting units or any of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets 
while the company does not believe that these events drop in additional revenue for the next three years or basis point increases in weighted average costs of capital or changes are likely to occur  it is reasonably possible these events could transpire if market conditions worsen and if the market fails to continue to recover in and or any significant changes to these assumptions and factors could have a material impact on the company s goodwill impairment analysis 
inherent in our projections are key assumptions relative to how long the current downward cycle might last 
service and product warranties the company provides service and warranty policies on certain of its products 
the company accrues liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with asc topic contingencies asc topic 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change 
in addition  the company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues and accrues for them when they are encountered 
at december  and  service and product warranties totaled million and million  respectively 

table of contents income taxes the company is a us registered company and is subject to income taxes in the us the company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the company operates and income is earned 
the company s annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year 
the company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation  which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries 
the company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
the annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the company considers appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may not be deductible in foreign jurisdictions 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means 
the company is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments 
the company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in asc topic income taxes asc topic 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year  the effect will be recognized in the period of the event 
the company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the company s valuation allowances 
the realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income 
any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
the company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  the company may be required to record additional taxes 
unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company makes an annual determination whether to permanently reinvest these earnings 
if  as a result of these reassessments  the company distributes these earnings in the future  additional tax liability would result  offset by any available foreign tax credits 
the company does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
additional information concerning each of these matters follows foreign currency exchange rates we have extensive operations in foreign countries 
the net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency 
these operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency  which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income 
during the years ended december   and  the company reported foreign currency gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
the gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and in adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of the current economic environment 
strengthening of currencies against the us dollar may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency 
some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those us dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency 
similarly some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies  but have associated us dollar costs  which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
in order to mitigate that risk  we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes

these market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities 
the company estimates that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by million 

table of contents the counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential 
we assess the functional currencies of our operating units to ensure that the appropriate currencies are utilized in accordance with the guidance of asc topic foreign currency matters 
effective january   we changed the functional currency of our rig technology unit in norway from the norwegian krone to the us dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which they operate 
this change was precipitated by significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances  including the increased order rate for large drilling platforms and components technology  the use of our norway unit as our preferred project manager of these projects  increasing revenue and cost base in us dollars  and the implementation of an international cash pool denominated in us dollars 
as a norwegian krone functional unit  norway was subject to increasing foreign currency exchange risk as a result of these changes in its economic environment and was dependent upon significant hedging transactions to offset its non functional currency positions 
at december   our norway operations had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating  million with a fair value of million to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk against the us dollar  our reporting currency 
effective with the change in the functional currency  the company terminated these hedges 
the related net gain position of million associated with the terminated hedges has been deferred and is being recognized into earnings in the future period s the forecasted transactions affect earnings  of which million remains to be recognized into future earnings at december  the company has subsequent to january   entered into new hedges to cover the exposures as a result of the changes to us dollar functional 
at december   our norway operations had derivatives with  million in notional value with a fair value of million  included in the table above 
interest rate risk at december  our long term borrowings consisted of million in senior notes  million in senior notes  million in senior notes  million in senior notes and million in senior notes 
we occasionally have borrowings under our credit facility  and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from libor  nibor or euribor  or at the prime interest rate 
under our credit facility  we may  at our option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor  nibor or euribor for days to months
