however  production  selling and general and administrative expenses combined have decreased over the same period primarily as a result of our cost control initiatives 
other events on january   we entered into a one year retransmission consent agreement with mediacom for continued carriage of the signals of stations owned and or operated by us in markets  on january   we commenced tender offers to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding notes and notes at of the face value of such notes

industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections 
in every fourth year  such as  political advertising is elevated further due to the presidential election 
in addition  political revenue has consistently risen between election years such as from to  the fcc has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi channel broadcasts 
the fcc must carry rules only apply to a station s primary digital stream  a number of other broadcasters  including sinclair  have joined together in what is known as the open mobile video coalition to promote the development of mobile dtv applications 
we believe there is potential for broadcasters to create an additional revenue stream by providing their signals to mobile devices as well as through other multi channel initiatives  
table of contents retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from multi channel video programming distributors mvpds who carry broadcasters signals 
recognition of the value of the programming content provided by broadcasters  including local news and other programming and network programming all in hd has generated increased local revenues  automotive related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues trended downward in and most of due to the recent economic turmoil 
however  a positive trend has begun for the sector in the fourth quarter of and into as of the date of this filing  many broadcasters are enhancing upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content  such as newscasts and weather updates  to attract advertisers  seasonal advertising increases in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers  although this trend was disrupted in due to the recession  broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements  station outsourcing arrangements are becoming more common as broadcasters seek out ways to improve revenues and margins  advertising revenue related to the olympics occurs in even numbered years and the super bowl is aired on a different network each year 
both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues  and compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has essentially halted 
networks may begin to ask for compensation from broadcasters for the use of network programming 
certain networks have already begun this process 
sources of revenues and costs our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers 
from to  we began to generate new local revenues from our retransmission consent agreements 
our revenues from local advertisers had seen a continued upward trend until when non political revenues fell from due to the economic recession 
further deterioration of advertising revenues occurred in revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers including the success of multi channel digital initiatives together with mobile dtv 
in addition  our revenue success is dependent on the success and advertising spending levels of the automotive industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents valuation of goodwill  long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires such assets along with our goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when certain triggering events occur 
as of december   we had million of goodwill  million in broadcast licenses  and million in definite lived intangibles 
we test our broadcast licenses and broadcast goodwill by estimating the fair market value of the broadcast licenses  or the fair value of our reporting units in the case of goodwill  using a combination of quoted market prices  observed earnings cash flow multiples paid for comparable television stations  discounted cash flow models and appraisals 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if an impairment exists 
we aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because we view  manage and evaluate our stations on a market basis 
furthermore  in our markets operated as duopolies  certain costs of operating the stations are shared including the use of buildings and equipment  the sales force and administrative personnel 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area  as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
future events could cause us to conclude that market conditions have declined or discount rates have increased to the extent that our broadcast licenses and or goodwill could be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
based on assessments performed during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in impairment losses on our goodwill  broadcast licenses and other assets 
the impairment charge taken in was primarily due to the severe economic downturn during the fourth quarter  and as a result  we made downward revisions to forecasted cash flow  cash flow multiples and growth rates 
of the million in impairment recorded in  we recorded million in the first quarter of we performed an interim impairment test in the first quarter of due to the severe economic downturn and continued decrease in our market capitalization 
accordingly  we made further revisions to our forecasted cash flows  cash flow multiples  and discount rates 
the impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of was primarily due to the continued deterioration of the economy which resulted in further decreases in our forecasted cash flow and increases in our discount rates 
there was no impairment recorded for the year ended december  the implied value of our broadcast goodwill is calculated using a discounted cash flow model for years and estimating the terminal value of the reporting units using a multiple of cash flows 
the value of our broadcast licenses is calculated using a discounted cash flow model for eight years and estimating the terminal value based on the constant growth model and a compound annual growth rate 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses consist of discount rates  revenue and expense growth rates  constant growth rates and comparable business multiples 
the revenue and expense growth rates used in our goodwill impairment testing and the revenue  expense and constant growth rates used in determining the fair value of our broadcast licenses are relatively comparable from to however  the baseline cash flows to which these growth rates were applied decreased due to the continued deterioration of the economy 
the growth rates are based on market studies  industry knowledge and historical performance 
the discount rates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses have increased from to the discount rate is based on a number of factors including market interest rates  a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on the target capital structure for a television station  and includes adjustments for market risk and company specific risk 
the increase in the discount rate is primarily due to a more heavily weighted cost of equity in as well as an increase in the general cost of equity 
the comparable business multiple used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment has decreased slightly from to it is an estimate of the multiple that would most likely be paid for a mature  cash flowing television station in the current marketplace 
the decrease in the multiple is primarily due to the continued deterioration in the economy 
as of december   none of our reporting units tested for goodwill impairment had fair values in excess of the carrying value where the excess was less than of the carrying value 

table of contents for the year ended december   an increase in our discount rate of would increase our goodwill impairment by million and a decrease in our multiple of would increase our goodwill impairment by million 
an increase in our discount rate of greater than or a decrease in our multiple of greater than would likely change the number of reporting units that would fail our step test for goodwill impairment and could lead to additional amounts of goodwill impairment 
when factors indicate that there may be a decrease in value of an equity or cost method investment  we assess that investment and determine whether a loss in value has occurred 
if that loss is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment loss is recorded accordingly 
for any investments that indicate a potential impairment  we estimate the fair value of those investments using discounted cash flow models  unrelated third party valuations or industry comparables  based on the various facts available to us 
revenue recognition 
advertising revenues  net of agency commissions  are recognized in the period during which commercials are aired 
all other revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights 
our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash 
we have determined that our agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value 
revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above 
revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase in the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would increase bad debt expense by approximately million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in program contract assets and million and million  respectively  in program contract liabilities 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based on management s expectation of future advertising revenue  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms 
in conjunction with our nrv analysis of programming rights reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  we perform similar analysis on future programming rights yet to be reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and establish allowances when future payments exceed the estimated nrv 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four year accelerated method or a straight line method  depending on the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not reflected by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
income tax 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in deferred tax assets and million and million  respectively  in deferred tax liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on the weight of available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   valuation allowances have been provided for a substantial amount of our available state net operating losses 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  accruals are adjusted as necessary in accordance with income tax accounting guidance 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income on the face of the statement of operations 
changes in a parent s ownership interest that result in deconsolidation of a subsidiary will result in the recognition of a gain or loss in net income when the subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the guidance also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we applied the requirements of this guidance retrospectively to our consolidated financial statements 
this guidance resulted in a change to the presentation of loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and net income loss attributable to sinclair broadcast group on the face of the income statement and the disclosure of noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions in the statement of cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
issuers were required to determine the carrying value of just the liability portion of the debt by measuring the fair value of a similar liability including any embedded features other than the conversion option that does not have an associated equity component 
the excess of the initial proceeds received from the debt issuance and the fair value of the liability component are recorded as a debt discount with the offset recorded to equity 
the discount is amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the life of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
transaction costs incurred with third parties shall be allocated between the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs  respectively  with the debt issuance costs amortized to interest expense 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in  we recorded the impact of this guidance retrospectively by recording additional interest expense on our notes related to the amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amortization of the debt discount will create additional noncash interest expense in  however we expect this interest to be minimal as we expect to redeem the remaining notes in may in april  the fasb issued amended guidance for determining the useful life of an intangible asset 
the guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
this guidance applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions 
historical experience renewing or extending similar arrangements or in the absence of such experience  assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension adjusted for entity specific factors should be considered 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
this guidance could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if we make future acquisitions 
in march  the fasb issued amended guidance related to the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies 
the guidance requires that an asset or liability arising from a contingency in a business combination be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably determined 
if the fair value cannot be reasonably determined  the asset or liability should be accounted for in accordance with other gaap  specifically the current accounting guidance related to accounting for contingencies 
this guidance requires that assets and liabilities arising from contingencies be subsequently measured and accounted for using a systematic and rational basis depending on their nature 
the amended guidance is effective for acquisitions that occur on january  or later 
we did not make any acquisitions during this guidance could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if we make future acquisitions 
in april  the fasb issued amended guidance which identifies the factors that a reporting entity should evaluate to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal market activity for the asset or liability and factors to consider related to whether a transaction is orderly 
when there has been a significant decrease in the volume of activity or the transaction is not orderly  a significant adjustment to the transaction or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value in accordance with the accounting guidance for fair value measurements 
this amended guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for the quarter ended after march  this guidance does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the intent of this guidance is to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements 
the new guidance will require us to perform ongoing reassessments of whether we are 
table of contents the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this guidance is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
we have not determined the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force s amended guidance on accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amended guidance allows the use of an estimated selling price for the undelivered units of accounting in transactions in which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe does not exist 
the amended guidance no longer allows the use of the residual method when allocating arrangement consideration between the delivered and undelivered units of accounting if vsoe and tpe of selling price does not exist for all units of accounting 
entities are required to estimate the selling price of the deliverables  when vsoe and tpe are not available  and then allocate the consideration based on the relative selling prices of the deliverables 
this guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  and should be applied on a prospective basis 
we have not determined the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb updated the codification to provide further guidance on how to measure the fair value of a liability 
the updated guidance sets forth the types of valuation techniques to be used to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
it clarifies that a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
it clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
the update is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
this guidance does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations in general  this discussion is related to the results of our continuing operations  except for discussions regarding our cash flows which also include the results of our discontinued operations

additionally  any references to the first  second  third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended march  june  september and december  respectively  for the year being discussed 
during  we determined we have two reportable segments  broadcast and other operating divisions that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities 
we have restated prior period information to reflect fasb accounting guidance related to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash conversion and guidance for the recognition of noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements

net broadcast revenues 
from a revenue category standpoint  when compared to was impacted by decreases in virtually all of the advertising sectors 
however  during the later half of the year  we did see a positive trend in increased advertising spending which continued through the end of the year 
services was our largest category in  however  during the fourth quarter we began to see a trend back towards the historical norm of automotive advertising representing our largest category as automotive dealers and manufacturers increased spending 
during  automotive revenues were helped by the government s cash for clunkers program  however  our net times sales from the automotive sector were still down for compared to from to  non political local revenues remained static while non political national revenues decreased 
revenues were affected by negative financial and economic conditions  especially in the latter part of  which resulted in smaller advertising budgets 
the negative economic effects were partially offset by favorable increases in revenues from retransmission consent 
table of contents agreements  revenues related to our acquisition of kfxa tv in cedar rapids  iowa and kgan tv which was previously accounted for as an outsourcing agreement and fox s broadcasting of the super bowl in political revenues 
political revenues  which include time sales from political advertising  decreased by million to million for when compared to political revenues are typically lower in non election years such as and were especially robust in because of the presidential election 
in  however  we earned political revenue related to health care and state related issues 
with the absence of an election year  political revenues were only million 
accordingly  we expect political revenues to increase in from levels 
local revenues 
excluding political revenues  our local broadcast revenues which include local times sales  retransmission revenues  network compensation and other local revenues  were down million for  compared to this decrease was primarily due to negative financial and economic conditions which impeded advertising spending levels  as well as  a decrease due to a change in networks for the super bowl programming from fox to nbc 
these decreases were offset by an increase in revenues from retransmission consent agreements with mvpds 
during the fourth quarter  we did begin to see favorable trends in advertising spending 
excluding political revenues  our local broadcast revenues were down million for  compared to the end of was also impacted by negative financial and economic conditions 
this decrease was offset by an increase in revenues from retransmission consent agreements with mvpds 
national revenues 
excluding political revenues  our national broadcast revenues  which include national time sales and other national revenues  were down million for  when compared to this decrease was partially due to negative financial and economic conditions which impeded advertising spending levels 
excluding political revenues  our national broadcast revenues were down million for when compared to over the past few years  national revenues have trended downwards 
we believe this trend represents a shift in the way national advertising dollars are being spent and we believe this trend will continue in the future 
advertisers in major categories are shifting significant portions of their advertising budgets away from spot television into non traditional media  in store promotions and product placement in network shows 
automotive decreases were due to automotive companies reducing advertising budgets as a result of the extreme detrimental market conditions in their industry as well as the overall economy and shifting advertising to specific markets 
broadcast expenses the following table presents our significant operating expense categories for the three years ended december   and in millions percent change increase decrease vs 
vs 
station production expenses station selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments corporate general and administrative expenses gain on asset exchange impairment of goodwill and broadcast licenses in general  we have continued to put cost cutting initiatives into action including reductions in staffing levels  which have resulted in overall decreases to our station expenses when compared to the prior year 
station production expenses 
station production expenses for decreased compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expense of million 
electric expenses decreased million in compared to due to the digital signal conversion in june  resulting in the reduction of analog transmission electricity cost 
additionally  promotional advertising was lower by million related to our revised media spending plan 
when appropriate  we have made an effort to reduce cash outlays for expenses by utilizing trade transactions 
station production expenses for increased compared to in february  we acquired kfxa tv in cedar rapids and kfxa tv discontinued operating kgan tv  our other cedar rapids station  under an outsourcing agreement 
as a result  our station production expenses increased million 
additionally  compensation expense increased million  rating service fees increased million primarily due to contract renegotiations and electric expenses increased million due to higher 
table of contents electricity market rates 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of costs related to our lmas and outsourcing agreements of million due to lower payments to our outsourcing partners caused by reduced station performance in station selling  general and administrative expenses 
station selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower compensation expense of million and local commissions and national rep commissions savings of million and million  respectively  due to lower revenues in compared to station selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for compared to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in compensation expense of million  local commissions of million due to fewer account executives  and decreased bad debt expense of million due to improved collection efforts 
these decreases were partially offset by additional costs of million related to cedar rapids and an increase in health care costs of million due to higher health care payments related to higher claims 
we expect station production and station selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding barter  to trend higher than our results 
amortization of program contract costs and net realizable value adjustments 
the amortization of program contract costs decreased during compared to and compared to primarily due to a decrease in write downs of our program contract costs and program amortization 
write downs of our program contract costs were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in the past few years  we have seen a move to less expensive barter and short term program contracts which result in lower contract cost amortization 
we expect program contract amortization to trend lower in compared to corporate general and administrative expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses allocated to the broadcast segment include  among other things  corporate departmental compensation expenses  health and other insurance  rent  communication  consulting fees  legal fees and strategic development initiatives

table of contents seasonality cyclicality our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations 
usually  the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers 
the current negative financial and economic conditions have effected the usual seasonal fluctuations 
our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising 
in even numbered years  political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections 
additionally  every four years  political spending is elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election  although this trend may be disrupted due to the recession

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
at times we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt 
see note derivative instruments and note notes payable and commercial bank financing  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in october  we entered into a bank credit agreement by amending and restating the bank credit agreement 
as a result our term loan a and a were replaced by a term loan b 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our term loan b  and no amount drawn on our revolving credit facility 
any outstanding amounts accrue interest with a variable rate and therefore increases our risk to increases from interest rates 
during  the three month libor rate decreased 
we are exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
based on the quoted market price  the fair value of the notes  notes  notes  debentures and notes combined was million as of december  we estimate that adding to prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of these notes by million as of december  generally  the fair market value of these notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
during  our notes were acutely affected by the heightened liquidity risk prevailing in the market place and our ability to refinance debt 
after our successful fourth quarter debt refinancing  the fair market values of our notes increased from december  levels 
under certain circumstances  we will pay contingent cash interest to the holder of the notes and the notes commencing on may  and january   respectively 
the contingent cash interest feature for both issuances are embedded derivatives which have negligible fair values 
our notes and notes have put option features and were partially tendered in november
