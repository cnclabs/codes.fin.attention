introduction landstar system  inc and its subsidiary  landstar system holdings  inc together  referred to herein as landstar or the company  is a non asset based provider of freight transportation services and supply chain solutions 
the company offers customers services across multiple transportation modes  with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of freight to enterprise wide solutions to manage all of a customer s transportation and logistics needs 
landstar provides services principally throughout the united states and to a lesser extent in canada  and between the united states and canada  mexico and other countries around the world 
the company s services emphasize safety  information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers linked together by a series of technological applications which are provided and coordinated by the company 
landstar markets its freight transportation services and supply chain solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport and store customer s freight 
the nature of the company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue 
in the company s fiscal third quarter  the company completed the acquisitions of i national logistics management co 
together with a limited liability company and certain corporate subsidiaries and affiliates  nlm and ii a integration llc ai through ai acquisition llc  an entity which the company owns of the non voting  preferred interests and of the voting  common equity interests 
ai is a wholly owned subsidiary of ai acquisition 
these two acquisitions are referred to herein collectively as the recent acquisitions 
nlm and ai offer customers technology based supply chain solutions and other value added services on a fee for service basis 
nlm and ai are herein referred to as the acquired entities 
landstar markets its freight transportation services and supply chain solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents who enter into contractual arrangements with the company and are responsible for locating freight  making that freight available to landstar s capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers 
the company s third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company under exclusive lease arrangements the bco independent contractors  unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the company under non exclusive contractual arrangements the truck brokerage carriers  air cargo carriers  ocean cargo carriers  railroads and independent warehouse capacity providers warehouse capacity owners 
the company has contracts with all of the class domestic and canadian railroads and certain short line railroads and contracts with domestic and international airlines and ocean lines 
through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by landstar s technological applications  landstar operates a transportation services and supply chain solutions business primarily throughout north america with revenue of approximately billion during the most recently completed fiscal year 
the company reports the results of two operating segments the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment 
the transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of transportation services and supply chain solutions 
transportation services offered by the company include truckload and less than truckload transportation  rail intermodal  air cargo  ocean cargo  expedited ground and air delivery of time critical freight  heavy 
table of contents haul specialized  us canada and us mexico cross border  project cargo and customs brokerage 
supply chain solutions are based on advanced technology solutions offered by the company and include integrated multi modal solutions  outsourced logistics  supply chain engineering and warehousing 
also  supply chain solutions can be delivered through a software as a service model 
industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive products  paper  lumber and building products  metals  chemicals  foodstuffs  heavy machinery  retail  electronics  ammunition and explosives and military hardware 
in addition  the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies  including logistics and less than truckload service providers 
each of the independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment 
freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight 
supply chain solution customers are generally charged fees for the services provided 
revenue recognized by the transportation logistics segment when providing capacity to customers to haul their freight is referred to herein as transportation services revenue and revenue for freight management services recognized on a fee for service basis is referred to herein as transportation management fees 
the insurance segment is comprised of signature insurance company  a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary  and risk management claim services  inc this segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of landstar s operating subsidiaries 
in addition  it reinsures certain risks of the company s bco independent contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of landstar s operating subsidiaries 
revenue  representing premiums on reinsurance programs provided to the company s bco independent contractors  at the insurance segment represented approximately of the company s total revenue for changes in financial condition and results of operations management believes the company s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers 
management believes the most significant factors to the company s success include increasing revenue  sourcing capacity and controlling costs 
while customer demand  which is subject to overall economic conditions  ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue  the company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities 
management s primary focus with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate million or more of landstar revenue million dollar agents 
management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by million dollar agents and the number of million dollar agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents 
management believes the decrease in the number of million dollar agents in resulted from the significant downturn in the domestic economy that began in the later part of and continued throughout  and not necessarily from agent turnover 
there were million dollar agents from whose revenue fell below million in  primarily due to the economic downturn 
the following table shows the number of million dollar agents  the average revenue generated by these agents  the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years and the number of agent locations at each fiscal year end fiscal year number of million dollar agents average revenue generated per million dollar agent percent of consolidated revenue generated by million dollar agents number of independent commission sales agent locations at year end 
table of contents management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads volume and revenue per load by mode of transportation 
revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price 
those factors include the average length of haul  freight type  special handling and equipment requirements and delivery time requirements 
for shipments involving two or more modes of transportation  revenue is classified by the mode of transportation having the highest cost for the load 
the following table summarizes this data by mode of transportation for the past three fiscal years fiscal year revenue generated through in thousands bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers other number of loads bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers revenue per load bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers includes premium revenue generated by the insurance segment and warehousing and transportation management fee revenue generated by the transportation logistics segment 
includes  of transportation management fee revenue 
also  included in the and fiscal years was  and  respectively  of revenue derived from transportation services provided in support of disaster relief efforts provided under contracts that have expired 

table of contents also critical to the company s success is its ability to secure capacity  particularly truck capacity  at rates that allow the company to profitably transport customers freight 
the following table summarizes available truck capacity providers as of the end of the three most recent fiscal years dec 
 dec 
 dec 
 bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers approved and active other approved total available truck capacity providers number of trucks provided by bco independent contractors active refers to truck brokerage carriers who moved at least one load in the days immediately preceding the fiscal year end 
the company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
the company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims 
in addition  the company incurs selling  general and administrative costs essential to administering its business operations 
management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the company and establishes annual cost budgets which  in general  are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis 
purchased transportation represents the amount a bco independent contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight 
the amount of purchased transportation paid to a bco independent contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue generated by the haul 
purchased transportation paid to a truck brokerage carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed upon rate 
purchased transportation paid to rail intermodal  air cargo or ocean cargo carriers is based on contractually agreed upon fixed rates 
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage  rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of bco independent contractor and air cargo services 
purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and  on a consolidated basis  increases or decreases in proportion to the revenue generated through bco independent contractors and other third party capacity providers  transportation management fees and revenue from the insurance segment 
purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the availability of truck brokerage capacity  the price of fuel on revenue hauled by truck brokerage carriers and  to a lesser extent  on revenue hauled by railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers 
purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery 
commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed upon percentages of revenue or gross profit  defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation  or gross profit less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by landstar 
commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation  transportation management fees and the insurance segment and with changes in gross profit on services provided by truck brokerage carriers  rail intermodal  air cargo and ocean cargo carriers 
commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery 
revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents is referred to as net revenue 
net revenue over revenue is referred to as net margin 
in general  net margin on revenue hauled by bco independent contractors represents a fixed percentage of revenue due to the nature of the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents 
for revenue hauled by truck brokerage carriers  net margin is either fixed or variable as a percent of revenue  depending on the contract with each individual independent commission sales agent 
under certain 
table of contents contracts with independent commission sales agents  the company retains a fixed percentage of revenue and the agent retains the amount remaining less the cost of purchased transportation the retention contracts 
net margin on revenue hauled by rail  air cargo carriers  ocean cargo carriers and truck brokerage carriers  other than those under retention contracts  are variable in nature as the company s contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of gross profit  representing revenue less the cost of purchased transportation 
in general  approximately of the company s revenue in had a fixed net margin 
maintenance costs for company provided trailing equipment  bco independent contractor recruiting costs and bad debts from bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents are the largest components of other operating costs 
potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable 
for commercial trucking claims  landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
the company also retains liability for each general liability claim up to   for each workers compensation claim and up to  for each cargo claim 
the company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by truck brokerage carriers  rail intermodal capacity providers and air cargo and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the unfavorable development of existing claims could be expected to materially adversely affect landstar s results of operations 
employee compensation and benefits account for over half of the company s selling  general and administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment  amortization of intangible assets attributed to the acquisitions in and management information services equipment

legal matters as further described in periodic and current reports previously filed by landstar system  inc the company with the securities and exchange commission  the company and certain of its subsidiaries the defendants are defendants in a suit the litigation brought in the united states district court for the middle district of florida the district court by the owner operator independent drivers association  inc ooida and four former bco independent contractors the named plaintiffs and  with ooida  the plaintiffs on behalf of all independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company and its subsidiaries under exclusive lease arrangements the bco independent contractors 
the plaintiffs allege that certain aspects of the company s motor carrier leases and related practices with its bco independent contractors violate certain federal leasing regulations and seek injunctive relief  an unspecified amount of damages and attorneys fees 
on march   the district court denied the request by plaintiffs for injunctive relief  entered a judgment in favor of the defendants and issued written orders setting forth its rulings related to the decertification of the plaintiff class and other important elements of the litigation relating to liability  injunctive relief and monetary relief 
the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for 
table of contents the eleventh circuit the appellate court of certain of the district court s rulings in favor of the defendants 
the defendants asked the appellate court to affirm such rulings and filed a cross appeal with the appellate court with respect to certain other rulings of the district court 
on september   the appellate court issued its ruling  which  among other things  affirmed the district court s rulings that i the defendants are not prohibited by the applicable federal leasing regulations from charging administrative or other fees to bco independent contractors in connection with voluntary programs offered by the defendants through which a bco independent contractor may purchase discounted products and services for a charge that is deducted against the compensation payable to the bco independent contractor a charge back deduction  ii the plaintiffs are not entitled to restitution or disgorgement with respect to violations by defendants of the applicable federal leasing regulations but instead may recover only actual damages  if any  which they sustained as a result of any such violations and iii the claims of bco independent contractors may not be handled on a class action basis for purposes of determining the amount of actual damages  if any  they sustained as a result of any violations 
further  the analysis of the appellate court confirmed the absence of any violations alleged by the plaintiffs of the federal leasing regulations with respect to the written terms of all leases currently in use between the defendants and bco independent contractors 
however  the ruling of the appellate court reversed the district court s rulings i that an old version of the lease formerly used by defendants but not in use with any current bco independent contractor complied with applicable disclosure requirements under the federal leasing regulations with respect to adjustments to compensation payable to bco independent contractors on certain loads sourced from the us dept 
of defense  and ii that the defendants had provided sufficient documentation to bco independent contractors under the applicable federal leasing regulations relating to how the component elements of charge back deductions were computed 
the appellate court then remanded the case to the district court to permit the plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief with respect to these violations of the federal leasing regulations and to hold an evidentiary hearing to give the named plaintiffs an opportunity to produce evidence of any damages they actually sustained as a result of such violations 
each of the parties to the litigation has filed a petition with the appellate court seeking rehearing of the appellate court s ruling  however  there can be no assurance that any petition for rehearing will be granted 
although no assurances can be given with respect to the outcome of the litigation  including any possible award of attorneys fees to the plaintiffs  the company believes that i no plaintiff has sustained any actual damages as a result of any violations by the defendants of the federal leasing regulations and ii injunctive relief  if any  that may be granted by the district court on remand is unlikely to have a material adverse financial effect on the company 
the company is involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business 
based on knowledge of the facts and  in certain cases  opinions of outside counsel  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such other claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome  after provisions therefor  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company  but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected 
recently  the company has experienced a higher level of customer bad debt expense than typically experienced in the past 
management believes this resulted from the difficult economic environment experienced by the company s customers 
historically  management s estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct 
although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at december  is appropriate  a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables 
conversely  a more robust economic environment may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables 

table of contents landstar provides for the estimated costs of self insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date 
the ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management 
the company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim 
historically  the company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior year claims estimates 
during fiscal years  and  insurance and claims costs included   and  respectively  of favorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at december  the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
certain of these tax planning strategies result in a level of uncertainty as to whether the related tax positions taken by the company will result in a recognizable benefit 
the company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to such tax positions due to the corresponding level of uncertainty with respect to the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be realized 
management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the uncertainty in such income tax positions is appropriate 
to date  the company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the company s past provisions for exposures related to the uncertainty of such income tax positions are not appropriate 
significant variances from management s estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables  the ultimate resolution of self insured claims or the provision for uncertainty in income tax positions can all be expected to positively or negatively affect landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year
