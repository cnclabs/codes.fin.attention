critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  taxes  inventories  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies related to the following accounts or activities are those that are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the more significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  generally when products are shipped provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and management believes collectability is reasonably assured 
we consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable unless they are secured under an irrevocable letter of credit arrangement guaranteed by a reputable financial institution  and accordingly  we defer such revenue until amounts become due and payable 
the company classifies shipping and handling charges billed to customers as revenue 
shipping and handling costs paid to others are classified as a component of cost of sales when incurred 
we provide for returns and allowances as circumstances and facts require 
sales to our unconsolidated subsidiaries are made on terms similar to those prevailing with unrelated customers as noted above 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified through management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based  in part  on historical experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
we believe that our warranty experience is within the industry norms 
our standard warranty period is to months from the date of delivery to the customer depending on the product 
the warranty obligation on our certified engine products can vary from three to five years depending on the specific part and the actual hours of usage 
inventory reserves we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
those standards require that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
management considers one level below operating segments to be a reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually at year end 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
we operate wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
we record goodwill at the time of purchase for the amount of the purchase price over the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
intangible assets we amortize intangible assets acquired if they are determined to have definite useful lives 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology and trade names  are amortized on a straight line basis  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefits  over their estimated reasonable useful lives 
certain other intangible assets such as customer relationships are amortized using an accelerated method since the value of customer relationships is expected to decline at a faster rate 
deferred taxes based upon the substantial net operating loss carryforwards and expected future operating results  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions at december  may not be realized within the foreseeable future 
the balance of the total united states valuation allowance was million as of december  in addition  we have a foreign valuation allowance of million as of december  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits generated in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets 
as of december   undistributed earnings  except with respect to a portion of undistributed earnings from brc  are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for united states federal and state income taxes is provided thereon 
residual us taxes have been accrued applied as a reduction of net operating loss carryforwards on approximately million of earnings of brc that is not considered indefinitely reinvested 
such amounts could be drawn as a dividend or from brc in the future without us income tax consequences 
upon distributions of earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and 
table of contents withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
we have accrued such residual income taxes for all undistributed foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
it is not practical to determine the income tax impact in the event we repatriate undistributed foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested 
as of december   approximately million in foreign withholding taxes was accrued related to undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 
we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and debt financing 
additionally from time to time we raise funds from the equity capital markets to fund our capital expenditures  research and development  strategic acquisitions as well as to invest in and operate our existing operations and prospective new lines of business 
we believe the amounts available to us under our various credit agreements together with cash provided by operating activities will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital and other cash needs for worldwide operations for at least the next months 
for periods beyond months  although we do not have any plans to do so  we may seek additional financing to fund future operations through future offerings of equity or debt securities or through agreements with corporate partners with respect to the development of the company s technologies and products 
however  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements will substantially depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by prevailing economic conditions  and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency management 
the results and financial condition of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between certain foreign currencies and the us dollar 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has increased as a result of the growth of our international subsidiaries 
the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the local currency of the subsidiary 
an increase in the value of the us dollar increases the costs incurred by our subsidiaries  as a significant amount of our international subsidiaries inventory purchases are us dollar denominated  and thus the cost of our products  adversely affecting our competitiveness and profitability 
we monitor this risk and attempt to minimize the exposure through the management of cash disbursements in local currencies and  when deemed appropriate  the use of forward currency contracts 
we seek to hedge our foreign currency economic risk by minimizing our us dollar investment in foreign operations using foreign currency term loans to finance the operations of our foreign subsidiaries 
the term loans are denominated in local currencies and translated to us dollars at period end exchange rates
