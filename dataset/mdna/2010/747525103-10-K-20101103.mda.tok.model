item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent developments revenues of billion and net income of billion for fiscal were impacted by the following key items we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for cdma based wireless devices  an increase of  compared to approximately million msm integrated circuits in fiscal the chipset volume in fiscal was affected by the slowdown in the worldwide economy 
total reported device sales were approximately billion  an increase of approximately  compared to approximately billion in fiscal against this backdrop  the following recent developments occurred during fiscal with respect to key elements of our business or our industry worldwide wireless subscribers grew by approximately to reach approximately billion 
worldwide g subscribers all cdma based grew to approximately billion  approximately of total wireless subscribers  including approximately million cdma x xev do subscribers and approximately million wcdma hspa td scdma subscribers 
in the handset market  cdma based unit shipments grew an estimated year over year  compared to an estimated increase of year over year across all technologies 
in june  we won a mhz slot of broadband wireless access bwa spectrum in four telecom circles in india as a result of the completion of the bwa spectrum auction for billion 
we entered the bwa auction to facilitate the deployment of lte technology as a complement to the existing g hspa and ev do networks in india 
total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in us dollars as reported to us by our licensees of all licensed cdma based subscriber devices including handsets  modules  modem cards and other subscriber devices by our licensees during a particular period 
not all licensees report sales the same way eg  some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions  such as transportation  insurance and packing costs  while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports  and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time 
according to wireless intelligence estimates as of november   for the quarter ending september  wireless intelligence estimates for cdma x xev do subscribers do not include wireless local loop 
based on current reports by strategy analytics  a global research and consulting firm  in their august global handset market share update 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture  have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our cdma technology and other technologies 
we derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products  license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property  messaging and other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing and related services  software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we conduct business primarily through four reportable segments 
these segments are qualcomm cdma technologies  or qct  qualcomm technology licensing  or qtl  qualcomm wireless internet  or qwi  and qualcomm strategic initiatives  or qsi 
qct is a leading developer and supplier of cdma based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications  multimedia functions and global positioning system products 
qct s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices  particularly mobile phones  laptops  data modules  handheld wireless computers  data cards and infrastructure equipment 
the integrated circuits for wireless devices include the mobile station modem msm  mobile data modem mdm  qualcomm single chip qsc  qualcomm snapdragon qsd  radio frequency rf  power management pm and bluetooth devices 
these 
table of contents integrated circuits for wireless devices and system software perform voice and data communication  multimedia and global positioning functions  radio conversion between rf and baseband signals  power management and peripheral connectivity 
qct s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits 
the infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband cdma modem functionality in the wireless operator s base station equipment 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qct utilizes a fabless production business model  which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made 
integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test manufacturing processes 
we rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly  and most of the testing  of our integrated circuits 
our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits 
we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits 
turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits 
under the two stage manufacturing business model  we purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third party manufacturers for back end assembly and test services 
we refer to this two stage manufacturing business model as integrated fabless manufacturing ifm 
qtl grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdmaone  cdma  wcdma  cdma tdd including td scdma  gsm gprs edge and or ofdma standards and their derivatives 
qtl receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property 
license fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments 
ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale ie  licensee s selling price of licensed products  net of certain permissible deductions eg  certain shipping costs  packing costs  vat  etc qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees sales of cdmaone  cdma and wcdma subscriber equipment products 
qwi  which includes qualcomm enterprise services qes  qualcomm internet services qis  qualcomm government technologies qgov and firethorn  generates revenues primarily through mobile information products and services and software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications 
qes sells equipment  software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets and workforce 
through september  qes has shipped approximately  terrestrial based and satellite based mobile information units 
qis provides content enablement services for the wireless industry  including brew  the plaza suite and other services 
qis also provides qchat push to talk  qpoint and other products for wireless operators 
qgov provides development  hardware and analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to united states government agencies 
firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable mobile commerce services 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi consists of the company s strategic investment activities  including flo tv incorporated flo tv  our wholly owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary 
qsi makes strategic investments in early stage and other companies and in wireless spectrum  such as the bwa spectrum recently won in the auction in india  that we believe will open new markets for cdma and ofdma based technologies  support the design and introduction of new cdma and ofdma products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications or possess unique capabilities or technology 
our flo tv subsidiary offers its service over our nationwide multicast network based on our mediaflo media distribution system mds and mediaflo technology  which leverages the forward link only flo air interface standard 
this network is utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the united states 
flo tv s network uses the mhz spectrum for which we hold licenses nationwide 
we have commenced a restructuring plan under which we expect to exit the current flo tv service business 
additionally  we continue to evaluate strategic options for the flo tv business  which include  but are not limited to  operating the flo tv network under a new wholesale service model  sale to  or joint venture with  a third party  and or the sale of the spectrum licenses and the discontinuance of the operation of the network 
as part of our strategic investment activities  we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future 
nonreportable segments include the qualcomm mems technologies division  which continues to develop an interferometric modulator imod display technology based on micro electro mechanical system mems structure 
table of contents combined with thin film optics  the mediaflo technologies division  which is comprised of the flo technology group  which continues to develop our mediaflo mds and mediaflo technology  and the flo international group  which markets mediaflo for deployment outside of the united states  and other product initiatives 
looking forward the deployment of g networks enables increased voice capacity and higher data rates than prior generation networks  thereby supporting more minutes of use and a wide range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets  g connected computing devices and other consumer electronics 
many wireless operators are also planning to complement their existing g networks by deploying ofdma based technology  often called g  in new spectrum to gain additional capacity for data services 
as a result  we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for g and g g multimode products and services around the world 
as we look forward to the next several months  the following items are likely to have an impact on our business the worldwide transition to g cdma based networks is expected to continue 
with the recently completed auction of g spectrum in india  we look forward to network launches and expansion of g in that region along with the continued expansion of g in china 
we expect consumer demand for advanced g based devices  including smartphones  other data devices and new device categories  such as ebook readers and tablets  to continue at a strong pace 
we also expect growth in lower end g devices as g expands in emerging markets 
we still face significant competition in the lower end market from gsm based products  particularly in emerging markets 
we expect that cdma based device prices will continue to segment into high and low end due to increased development of smartphones and popularity of smartphone applications on the high end and high volumes and active competition throughout the world on both the low and high end 
this  along with a tempered economic recovery combined with growth in emerging markets  is expected to continue to impact the average selling price of cdma based devices 
we continue to invest significant resources toward the development of technology to increase the data rates available with g and g networks  wireless baseband chips  converged computing communication chips  multimedia products  software and services for the wireless industry 
we continue to invest in the evolution of cdma and a broad range of other technologies  such as lte  our imod display technology and our snapdragon platform  as part of our vision to enable a wide range of products and technologies 
we have commenced a restructuring plan under which we expect to exit the current flo tv service business 
additionally  we continue to evaluate strategic options for the flo tv business  which include  but are not limited to  operating the flo tv network under a new wholesale service model  sale to  or joint venture with  a third party  and or the sale of the spectrum licenses and the discontinuance of the operation of the network 
in addition to the foregoing business and market based matters  we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market 
however  we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new  highly cost effective competitors to their products 
we expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world 
further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the risk factors included in this annual report 
revenue concentrations revenues from customers in china  south korea  taiwan and japan comprised   and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues for fiscal  as compared to   and  respectively  for fiscal  and   and  respectively  for fiscal we distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products  software or services are delivered and  for qtl s licensing and royalty revenues  the invoiced addresses of our licensees 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  share based payments  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  royalties and license fees for our intellectual property  messaging and other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing and related services  software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but actual results may differ from our estimates 
we record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs  including special pricing agreements and other volume related rebate programs 
certain reductions to revenue for customer incentives are based on estimates  including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes  market share and inventory levels 
we license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products 
licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee  typically five to fifteen years 
we earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
from time to time  licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes or other reasons  and when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
we also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions 
at september   our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were billion and billion  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
for intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non monetary exchange  the estimated fair values of the assets received or  for non monetary exchanges  the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded values  except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value 
an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions which require significant judgment 
for example  the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows  total addressable market  pricing and share forecasts  competition  technology obsolescence  future tax rates and discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of certain assets  or our conclusion that the value of certain assets is not reliably estimable  may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models 
new information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use  including estimates of future cash flows  volumes  market penetration and discount rates  are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or 
table of contents their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our net investment income loss 
we hold minority investments in publicly traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile 
we also hold investments in other marketable securities  including non investment grade debt securities  equity and debt mutual and exchange traded funds  corporate bonds and notes  auction rate securities and mortgage and asset backed securities 
these investments  which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders equity as other comprehensive income or loss  totaled billion at september  we record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
in addition  the fair values of our strategic investments may be subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring impairment charges 
when assessing these investments for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost  the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class  negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others  the performance and pricing of the investee s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations  as applicable 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
if we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary  we may record an impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities 
share based compensation 
share based compensation expense recognized during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
share based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we generally estimate the value of stock option awards using a lattice binomial option pricing model 
accordingly  the fair value of an option award as determined using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options  we used the implied volatility of market traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model 
the assumption inputs related to employee exercise behavior include estimates of the post vest forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factors  which are based on historical experience 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  share based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
income taxes 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
we are participating in the irs compliance 
table of contents assurance process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the irs on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return 
a benefit of participation in this program is that post filing adjustments by the irs are less likely to occur 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
at september   gross deferred tax assets were billion 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
we can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions 
at september   we had unused federal  state and foreign net operating losses of million  million and million  respectively 
based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities  we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a million valuation allowance for these net operating losses 
significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made 
we consider the operating earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately billion related to the united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the united states 
should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position  we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
for example  we recorded a million charge during fiscal in connection with a litigation settlement charge related to the settlement and patent license and non assert agreement with broadcom 
we are engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and  while there can be no assurance  we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from two customers of our qct and qtl segments each of whom accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for the period comprised approximately and in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal the increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a million increase in qct revenues

cost of equipment and services 
cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal was billion  compared to billion for fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in margin percentage was primarily attributable to the effect of increases in costs related to our flo tv subsidiary and our qmt division  partially offset by an increase in qct gross margin percentage 
cost of equipment and services revenues included million in share based compensation in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal cost of equipment 
table of contents and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided  competitive pricing  new product introduction costs and other factors 
research and development expenses 
for fiscal  research and development expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products  next generation cdma and ofdma technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services  including lower cost devices  the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing  the convergence of multiband  multimode  multinetwork products and technologies  third party operating systems and services platforms 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in costs primarily related to the development of our asset tracking products and services and brew products 
research and development expenses for fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in selling and marketing expenses  a million increase in patent related costs and a million increase in employee related expenses  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of our australia spectrum license 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal other operating expenses 
operating expenses for fiscal included a million charge in connection with the settlement and patent license and non assert agreement with broadcom and a million fine levied by the kftc 
net investment income 
net investment income was million for fiscal  compared to a net investment loss of million for fiscal the net increase was comprised as follows in millions year ended september  september  change interest and dividend income corporate and other segments qsi interest expense net realized gains on investments corporate and other segments qsi net impairment losses on investments corporate and other segments qsi gains on derivative instruments equity in losses of investees during fiscal  we recorded lower impairment losses and higher realized gains on marketable securities  compared to fiscal depressed security values caused by a major disruption in the united states and foreign financial markets impacted our results in fiscal and continued to cause impairment losses in fiscal  but to a much lesser extent 
the increase in interest expense is primarily the result of the short term bank loan related to the bwa spectrum recently won in the india auction 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the annual effective tax rate was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the annual effective tax rate for fiscal was lower than fiscal primarily as a result of the net decrease in valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to capital losses and an increase in tax benefits related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal rate  partially offset by a decrease in tax benefit related to tax audits settled during the year and a decrease in research and development tax credits 
the annual effective tax rate for fiscal was and only reflected the united states federal research and development credits generated through december   the date on which they expired 
the annual effective tax 
table of contents rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal rate  related to a decrease in valuation allowance recorded in fiscal on the deferred tax asset related to capital losses and related to research and development tax credits  partially offset by state taxes of and tax expense of related to the valuation of deferred tax assets to reflect changes in california law  primarily deferred revenue that was taxable in fiscal  but for which the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when the company s state tax rate will be lower 
deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  increased during fiscal primarily due to the establishment of the deferred tax asset related to revenue derived from the company s license and settlement agreements with nokia 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from two customers of our qct and qtl segments each of whom accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for the period comprised approximately and in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a number of diversified investment and non investment grade fixed and floating rate securities  consisting of cash equivalents  marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest bearing securities 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed interest bearing securities could lose value 
when the general economy weakens significantly  the credit profile  financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate  and our interest bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
the following table provides information about our interest bearing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and loan payable to banks that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that the interest bearing securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate the securities for presentation purposes 

table of contents principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates dollars in millions no single thereafter maturity total fixed interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate time deposits interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate floating interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate loan payable to banks fixed interest rate cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
the loan payable to banks approximates fair value 
equity price risk 
we have a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities held by mutual and exchange traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk 
we have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size  style  industry and geography  and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares at september  would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of million 
at september   gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange traded fund shares were million 
although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary  there is a risk that we may incur net other than temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period 
foreign exchange risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties 
such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions 
in the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments  we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us  which could have a negative impact on our results 
at september   we had a net liability of million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of cdma based devices and a net liability of million related to foreign currency option contracts that have been rendered ineffective as a result of changes in our forecast of royalty revenues 
if our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in each of our hedged foreign currencies  we would incur a loss of approximately million resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective 
in addition  we are subject to market risk on foreign currency option contracts that have been deemed ineffective 
if foreign exchange rates relevant to those contracts were to change unfavorably by  we would incur a loss of million resulting from a decrease in the fair value of our hedges 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 

table of contents at september   we had a fixed rate short term bank loan of billion  which is payable in full in indian rupees in december the loan is payable in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiary that is party to the loan  however we are subject to foreign currency translation risk  which may impact the amount of our liability for principal repayment and interest expense we record in the future 
if the foreign currency exchange rate were to change unfavorably by  additional interest expense would be negligible due to the short term nature of the loan 
at september   we had an asset of million related to foreign currency forward contracts that were not designated as hedges of certain payments to be made in indian rupees in connection with the bank loan 
we are subject to market risk on such contracts 
if the foreign exchange rates relevant to those contracts were to change unfavorably by  we would incur a loss of million 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
