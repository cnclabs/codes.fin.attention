table of contents our distribution channels include direct to consumer sales at our outlet stores  national chains and department stores and warehouse clubs  mass merchandise outlets and international sales 
during  approximately of our net sales were to mass merchants in the united states  were to national chains and department stores in the united states  were in our international segment  were in our direct to consumer segment in the united states  and were to other retail channels in the united states such as embellishers  specialty retailers and sporting goods stores 
during the fourth quarter of  as we sought to drive more outerwear sales through our retail operations by expanding our hanes and champion offerings  we made the decision to change our internal organizational structure so that our retail operations  previously included in our innerwear segment  would be a separate direct to consumer segment 
as a result  our operations are managed and reported in six operating segments  each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes innerwear  outerwear  hosiery  direct to consumer  international and other 
certain other insignificant changes between segments have been reflected in the segment disclosures to conform to the current organizational structure 
these segments are organized principally by product category  geographic location and distribution channel 
management of each segment is responsible for the operations of these segments businesses but shares a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms 
innerwear 
the innerwear segment focuses on core apparel essentials  and consists of products such as women s intimate apparel  men s underwear  kids underwear  and socks  marketed under well known brands that are trusted by consumers 
we are an intimate apparel category leader in the united states with our hanes  playtex  bali  barely there  just my size and wonderbra brands 
we are also a leading manufacturer and marketer of men s underwear and kids underwear under the hanes and polo ralph lauren brand names 
during  net sales from our innerwear segment were billion  representing approximately of total net sales 
outerwear 
we are a leader in the casualwear and activewear markets through our hanes  champion  just my size and duofold brands  where we offer products such as t shirts and fleece 
our casualwear lines offer a range of quality  comfortable clothing for men  women and children marketed under the hanes and just my size brands 
the just my size brand offers casual apparel designed exclusively to meet the needs of plus size women 
in  we entered into a multi year agreement to provide a women s casualwear program with our just my size brand at wal mart stores 
in addition to activewear for men and women  champion provides uniforms for athletic programs and includes an apparel program  c by champion  at target stores 
we also license our champion name for collegiate apparel and footwear 
we also supply our t shirts  sport shirts and fleece products  including brands such as hanes  champion  outer banks and hanes beefy t  to customers  primarily wholesalers  who then resell to screen printers and embellishers 
during  net sales from our outerwear segment were billion  representing approximately of total net sales 
hosiery 
we are the leading marketer of women s sheer hosiery in the united states 
we compete in the hosiery market by striving to offer superior values and executing integrated marketing activities  as well as focusing on the style of our hosiery products 
we market hosiery products under our l eggs  hanes and just my size brands 
during  net sales from our hosiery segment were million  representing approximately of total net sales 
we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences 
direct to consumer 
our direct to consumer operations include our value based outlet stores and internet operations which sell products from our portfolio of leading brands 
we sell our branded products directly to consumers through our outlet stores as well as our web sites operating under the hanes  one hanes place  just my size and champion names 
our internet operations are supported by our catalogs 
as of january  and january   we had and outlet stores  respectively 
during  net sales from our direct to consumer segment were million  representing approximately of total net sales 
international 
international includes products that span across the innerwear  outerwear and hosiery reportable segments and are primarily marketed under the hanes  champion  wonderbra  playtex  stedman  zorba  rinbros  kendall  sol y oro  bali and ritmo brands 
during  net sales from our international segment were million  representing approximately of total net sales and included sales in latin america  asia  canada  europe and south america 
our largest international markets are canada  japan  mexico  europe and brazil  and we also have sales offices in india and china 

table of contents other 
our other segment primarily consists of sales of yarn to third parties in the united states and latin america that maintain asset utilization at certain manufacturing facilities and are intended to generate approximate break even margins 
during  net sales from our other segment were million  representing less than of total net sales 
in october  we completed the sale of our yarn operations as a result of which we ceased making our own yarn and now source all of our yarn requirements from large scale yarn suppliers 
as a result of the sale of our yarn operations we will no longer have net sales in our other segment in the future 
business and industry trends we are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
the current retail environment has been impacted by recent volatility in the financial markets and by uncertain economic conditions 
increases in food and fuel prices  changes in the credit and housing markets leading to the current financial and credit crisis  actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy  significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to consumer retirement and investment accounts  and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have all added to declines in consumer confidence and curtailed retail spending 
during  we did not see a sustained rebound in consumer spending but rather mixed results 
we also experienced substantial pressure on profitability due to the economic climate  increased pension costs and increased costs associated with implementing our price increase which became effective in february  including repackaging costs 
the apparel essentials market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly 
competition is generally based upon price  brand name recognition  product quality  selection  service and purchasing convenience 
the majority of our core styles continue from year to year  with variations only in color  fabric or design details 
some products  however  such as intimate apparel  activewear and sheer hosiery  do have an emphasis on style and innovation 
our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers  as well as smaller companies  department stores  specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell apparel essentials products under private labels that compete directly with our brands 
our top ten customers accounted for of our net sales and our top customer  wal mart  accounted for over billion of our sales in our largest customers in were wal mart  target and kohl s  which accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
the growth in retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek to have greater concessions in their purchase of our products  while they can be increasingly demanding that we provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis 
to counteract these effects  it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today s challenging economic environment 
in addition  during the past several years  various retailers  including some of our largest customers  have experienced significant difficulties  including restructurings  bankruptcies and liquidations  and the ability of retailers to overcome these difficulties may increase due to the recent deterioration of worldwide economic conditions 
anticipating changes in and managing our operations in response to consumer preferences remains an important element of our business 
in recent years  we have experienced changes in our net sales  revenues and cash flows in accordance with changes in consumer preferences and trends 
for example  we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences 
hosiery products continue to be more adversely impacted than other apparel categories by reduced consumer discretionary spending  which contributes to weaker sales and lowering of inventory levels by retailers 
the hosiery segment only comprised of our net sales in however  and as a result  the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales  revenues or cash flows 
generally  we manage the hosiery segment for cash  placing an emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently 

table of contents outlook we have secured significant shelf space and distribution gains  starting primarily in program gains significantly outnumber program losses  and we expect the net space gains to generate approximately incremental sales growth in  independent of a consumer spending rebound 
if consumer spending does rebound  we have potential for additional upside in sales growth 
by segment  two thirds of the increases are expected in our innerwear segment and most of the remainder in our outerwear segment 
however  both our direct to consumer and international segments should also see mid single digit growth in specifically for our innerwear segment  the bulk of the gains are in men s underwear and intimate apparel 
the new programs in men s underwear have already begun to ship  with the new intimate apparel program starting to ship in the second quarter of the remaining growth in the innerwear segment in the back half of the year will be driven by replenishment of these new programs 
for the outerwear segment  growth will be driven by the expansion of our just my size brand in the first half as a result of a multi year agreement we entered into with wal mart in april that significantly expanded the presence of our just my size brand 
in the second half of  champion has confirmed space and distribution gains in fleece  performance apparel and sports bras across a broad set of accounts 
our projected sales growth  combined with our cost savings  should drive greater operating profit growth in to support this growth  we have increased our production capacity 
our nanjing textile facility started production in the fourth quarter of and is right on plan 
we also secured additional capacity with outside contractors 
the earthquake in haiti caused some short term disruption and incremental costs in early  however we do not believe it will have a material impact on net sales 
our key business strategies sell more  spend less and generate cash are our broad strategies to build our brands  reduce our costs and generate cash 
sell more through our sell more strategy  we seek to drive profitable growth by consistently offering consumers brands they love and trust and products with unsurpassed value 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include build big  strong brands in big core categories with innovative key items 
our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success 
our design  research and product development teams  in partnership with our marketing teams  drive our efforts to bring innovations to market 
we seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the apparel essentials industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing  addressing changing customer needs and industry trends 
we also support our key brands with targeted  effective advertising and marketing campaigns 
foster strategic partnerships with key retailers via team selling 
we foster relationships with key retailers by applying our extensive category and product knowledge  leveraging our use of multi functional customer management teams and developing new customer specific programs such as c by champion for target and the recently expanded presence at wal mart of our just my size brand 
our goal is to strengthen and deepen our existing strategic relationships with retailers and develop new strategic relationships 
use kanban concepts to have the right products available in the right quantities at the right time 
through kanban  a multi initiative effort that determines production quantities  and in doing so  facilitates just in time production and ordering systems  we seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels 

table of contents spend less through our spend less strategy  we seek to become an integrated organization that leverages its size and global reach to reduce costs  improve flexibility and provide a high level of service 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include optimizing our global supply chain to improve our cost competitiveness and operating flexibility 
we have restructured our supply chain over the past three years to create more efficient production clusters that utilize fewer  larger facilities and to balance our production capability between the western hemisphere and asia 
we have closed plant locations  reduced our workforce and relocated some of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations in asia  central america and the caribbean basin 
with our global supply chain infrastructure substantially in place  we are now focused on optimizing our supply chain to further enhance efficiency  improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs 
the consolidation of our distribution network is still in process but will not result in any substantial charges in future periods 
the distribution network consolidation involves the implementation of new warehouse management systems and technology  and opening of new distribution centers and new third party logistics providers to replace parts of our legacy distribution network 
leverage our global purchasing and manufacturing scale 
historically  we have had a decentralized operating structure with many distinct operating units 
we are in the process of consolidating purchasing  manufacturing and sourcing across all of our product categories in the united states 
we believe that these initiatives will streamline our operations  improve our inventory management  reduce costs and standardize processes 
generate cash through our generate cash strategy  we seek to effectively generate and invest cash at or above our weighted average cost of capital to provide superior returns for both our equity and debt investors 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include optimizing our capital structure to take advantage of our business model s strong and consistent cash flows 
maintaining appropriate debt leverage and utilizing excess cash to  for example  pay down debt  invest in our own stock and selectively pursue strategic acquisitions are keys to building a stronger business and generating additional value for investors 
in  we completed a growth focused debt refinancing that enables us to simultaneously reduce leverage and consider acquisition opportunities 
continuing to improve turns for accounts receivables  inventory  accounts payable and fixed assets 
our ability to generate cash is enhanced through more efficient management of accounts receivables  inventory  accounts payable and fixed assets through several initiatives  such as supplier managed inventory for raw materials  sourced goods ownership relationships and other efforts 
consolidation and globalization strategy we have restructured our supply chain over the past three years to create more efficient production clusters that utilize fewer  larger facilities and to balance our production capability between the western hemisphere and asia 
we have closed plant locations  reduced our workforce and relocated some of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations in asia  central america and the caribbean basin 
with our global supply chain infrastructure substantially in place  we are now focused on optimizing our supply chain to further enhance efficiency  improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs 
we are focused on optimizing the working capital needs of our supply chain through several initiatives  such as supplier managed inventory for raw materials and sourced goods ownership relationships 
we completed the construction of a textile production plant in nanjing  china which is our first company owned textile facility in asia 
production commenced in the fourth quarter of and we expect to ramp up production over the next months 
the nanjing facility  along with our other textile facilities and arrangements with outside contractors  enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres to support our production capacity 
the consolidation of our distribution network is still in process but will not result in any substantial charges in future periods 
the distribution network consolidation involves the 
table of contents implementation of new warehouse management systems and technology  and opening of new distribution centers and new third party logistics providers to replace parts of our legacy distribution network 
during  we ceased making our own yarn and now source all of our yarn requirements from large scale yarn suppliers 
we entered into an agreement with parkdale america  llc parkdale america under which we agreed to sell or lease assets related to operations at our four yarn manufacturing facilities to parkdale america 
the transaction closed in october and resulted in parkdale america operating three of the four facilities 
we approved an action to close the fourth yarn manufacturing facility  as well as a yarn warehouse and a cotton warehouse  all located in the united states  which will result in the elimination of approximately positions 
we also entered into a yarn purchase agreement with parkdale america and parkdale mills  llc together with parkdale america  parkdale 
under this agreement  which has an initial term of six years  parkdale will produce and sell to us a substantial amount of our western hemisphere yarn requirements 
during the first two years of the term  parkdale will also produce and sell to us a substantial amount of the yarn requirements of our nanjing  china textile facility 
in addition to the actions discussed above  during we approved actions to close seven manufacturing facilities and three distribution centers in the dominican republic  the united states  costa rica  honduras  puerto rico and canada which will result in the elimination of an aggregate of approximately  positions in those countries and el salvador 
the production capacity represented by the manufacturing facilities has been relocated to lower cost locations in asia  central america and the caribbean basin 
the distribution capacity has been relocated to our west coast distribution facility in california in order to expand capacity for goods we source from asia 
in addition  approximately management and administrative positions were eliminated  with the majority of these positions based in the united states 
we also have recognized accelerated depreciation with respect to owned or leased assets associated with manufacturing facilities and distribution centers which closed during or we anticipate closing in the next year as part of our consolidation and globalization strategy 
as a result of the restructuring actions taken since our becoming an independent company on september   our cost structure has been reduced and efficiencies improved  generating savings of million during in addition to the savings generated from restructuring actions  we benefited from million in savings related to other cost reduction initiatives during as a result of our consolidation and globalization strategy  we expected to incur approximately million in restructuring and related charges over the three year period following the spin off from sara lee on september   of which approximately half was expected to be noncash 
through this three year period  we have recognized approximately million in restructuring and related charges related to this strategy  of which approximately half have been noncash 
of the amounts recognized  approximately million related to employee termination and other benefits  approximately million related to accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment for facilities that have been or will be closed  approximately million related to noncancelable lease and other contractual obligations  approximately million related to write offs of stranded raw materials and work in process inventory determined not to be salvageable or cost effective to relocate  approximately million related to impairments of fixed assets and approximately million related to other exit costs such as equipment moving costs 
accelerated depreciation related to our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers that have been or will be closed is reflected in the cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses lines of the consolidated statements of income 
the write offs of stranded raw materials and work in process inventory are reflected in the cost of sales line of the consolidated statements of income 
seasonality and other factors our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors 
generally  our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items 
sales are typically higher in the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year 
socks  hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during this period as a result of cooler weather  back to school shopping and holidays 
sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand 
our customers may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us 
for example  we have experienced a shift in timing by our largest retail customers of back to school programs between june and july the last two years 
our results of operations are also impacted by fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton and oil related materials and the 
table of contents timing of actual spending for our media  advertising and promotion expenses 
media  advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions 
although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned  rather than on an impulse  basis  our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by our customers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others  general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  currency exchange rates  taxation  electricity power rates  gasoline prices  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
many of these factors are outside of our control 
our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower  when prices increase in response to rising costs  or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lower priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products  or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time 
inflation and changing prices inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins 
for example  a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs 
similarly  the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process  such as oil related commodity prices and other raw materials  such as dyes and chemicals  and other costs  such as fuel  energy and utility costs  can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors 
in addition  inflation often is accompanied by higher interest rates  which could have a negative impact on spending  in which case our margins could decrease 
moreover  increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in income  which also could have a negative impact on spending 
if we incur increased costs that we are unable to recoup  or if consumer spending continues to decrease generally  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of incremental costs on our operating results  we raised domestic prices effective february we implemented an average gross price increase of four percent in our domestic product categories 
the range of price increases varied by individual product category 
although we have sold our yarn operations  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large scale yarn suppliers 
our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
while we do employ a dollar cost averaging strategy by entering into hedging contracts from time to time in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices  although cotton represents only of our cost of sales 
the cotton prices reflected in our results were cents per pound in and cents per pound in costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold 
components of net sales and expenses net sales we generate net sales by selling apparel essentials such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  socks  hosiery  casualwear and activewear 
our net sales are recognized net of discounts  coupons  rebates  volume based incentives and cooperative advertising costs 
we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
net sales include an estimate for returns and allowances based upon historical return experience 
we also offer a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers that are recorded as reductions to net sales 
royalty income from license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate our brands is also included in net sales 

table of contents cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing finished goods  which consists of labor  raw materials such as cotton and petroleum based products and overhead costs such as depreciation on owned facilities and equipment 
our cost of sales also includes finished goods sourced from third party manufacturers that supply us with products based on our designs as well as charges for slow moving or obsolete inventories 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
our costs of sales do not include shipping costs  comprised of payments to third party shippers  or handling costs  comprised of warehousing costs in our distribution facilities  and thus our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities that include such costs in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include selling  advertising  costs of shipping  handling and distribution to our customers  research and development  rent on leased facilities  depreciation on owned facilities and equipment and other general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  insurance and legal expenses 
restructuring we have from time to time closed facilities and reduced headcount  including in connection with previously announced restructuring and business transformation plans 
we refer to these activities as restructuring actions 
when we decide to close facilities or reduce headcount  we take estimated charges for such restructuring  including charges for exited non cancelable leases and other contractual obligations  as well as severance and benefits 
if the actual charge is different from the original estimate  an adjustment is recognized in the period such change in estimate is identified 
other expense income our other expense income include charges such as losses on early extinguishment of debt  costs to amend and restate our credit facilities and charges related to the termination of certain interest rate hedging arrangements 
interest expense  net our interest expense is net of interest income 
interest income is the return we earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate fluctuates from period to period and can be materially impacted by  among other things changes in the mix of our earnings from the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the tax characteristics of our earnings  the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we repatriate to the united states  which may increase our tax expense and taxes paid  and the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact business

gross capital expenditures were million in as we continued to build out our textile and sewing network in asia  central america and the caribbean basin and were lower by million compared to in december  we completed a growth focused debt refinancing that enables us to simultaneously reduce leverage and consider acquisition opportunities 
the refinancing gives us more flexibility in our use of excess cash flow  allows continued debt reduction  and provides a stable long term capital structure with extended debt maturities at rates slightly lower than previous effective rates 
the refinancing consisted of the sale of our million senior notes and the concurrent amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facility to provide for the billion senior secured credit facility 
the proceeds from the sale of the senior notes  together with the proceeds from borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  were used to refinance borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  to repay all borrowings under our existing second lien credit facility and to pay fees and expenses relating to these transactions

liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and availability under our revolving loan facility  accounts receivable securitization facility and our international loan facilities 
at january   we had million of borrowing availability under our million revolving loan facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  million of borrowing availability under our accounts receivable securitization facility  million in cash and cash equivalents and million of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations  together with our available credit capacity  will enable us to comply with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements 
the following have impacted or are expected to impact liquidity we have principal and interest obligations under our debt  we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs  we expect to continue to ramp up our lower cost manufacturing capacity in asia  central america and the caribbean basin and enhance efficiency  we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions  we could increase or decrease the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states  which could significantly impact our effective income tax rate  and our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our stock in the open market over the next few years million of which we have repurchased as of january  at a cost of million  although we may choose not to repurchase any stock and instead focus on the repayment of our debt in the next months in light of the current economic recession 

table of contents we have restructured our supply chain over the past three years to create more efficient production clusters that utilize fewer  larger facilities and to balance our production capability between the western hemisphere and asia 
with our global supply chain infrastructure substantially in place  we are now focused on optimizing our supply chain to further enhance efficiency  improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs 
we are focused on optimizing the working capital needs of our supply chain through several initiatives  such as supplier managed inventory for raw materials and sourced goods ownership relationships 
the consolidation of our distribution network is still in process but will not result in any substantial charges in future periods 
the distribution network consolidation involves the implementation of new warehouse management systems and technology  and opening of new distribution centers and new third party logistics providers to replace parts of our legacy distribution network 
we are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
the retail environment has been impacted by recent volatility in the financial markets  including stock prices  and by uncertain economic conditions 
increases in food and fuel prices  changes in the credit and housing markets leading to the current financial and credit crisis  actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy  significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to consumer retirement and investment accounts  and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have all added to declines in consumer confidence and curtailed retail spending 
during  we did not see a sustained rebound in consumer spending but rather mixed results 
we also experienced substantial pressure on profitability due to the economic climate  increased pension costs and increased costs associated with implementing our price increase which became effective in february  including repackaging costs 
hosiery products continue to be more adversely impacted than other apparel categories by reduced consumer discretionary spending  which contributes to weaker sales and lowering of inventory levels by retailers 
the hosiery segment comprised only of our net sales in however  and as a result  the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales or cash flows 
generally  we manage the hosiery segment for cash  placing an emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently 
we expect to be able to manage our working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
factors that could help us in these efforts include higher sales volume and the realization of additional cost benefits from previous restructuring and related actions 
during  we reduced our media spending as the continuing recession constrained consumer spending 
in we anticipate that we will restore our media spending back to a range of to million in an effort to generate sales growth 
outlook we have secured significant shelf space and distribution gains  starting primarily in program gains significantly outnumber program losses  and we expect the net space gains to generate approximately incremental sales growth in  independent of a consumer spending rebound 
if consumer spending does rebound  we have potential for additional upside in sales growth 
by segment  two thirds of the increases are expected in our innerwear segment and most of the remainder in our outerwear segment 
however  both our direct to consumer and international segments should also see mid single digit growth in specifically for our innerwear segment  the bulk of the gains are in men s underwear and intimate apparel 
the new programs in men s underwear have already begun to ship  with the new intimate apparel program starting to ship in the second quarter of the remaining growth in the innerwear segment in the back half of the year will be driven by replenishment of these new programs 
for the outerwear segment  growth will be driven by the expansion of our just my size brand in the first half as a result of a multi year agreement we entered into with wal mart in april that significantly expanded the presence of our just my size brand 
in the second half of  champion has confirmed space and distribution gains in fleece  performance apparel and sports bras across a broad set of accounts

our nanjing textile facility started production in the fourth quarter of and is right on plan 
we also secured additional capacity with outside contractors 
the earthquake in haiti caused some short term disruption and incremental costs in early  however we do not believe it will have a material impact on net sales 
cash requirements for our business we rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our revolving loan facility  accounts receivable securitization facility and international loan facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business 
the primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business  restructuring costs  capital expenditures  maturities of debt and related interest payments  contributions to our pension plans and repurchases of our stock 
we believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for our liquidity needs 
the flexibility provided by our debt refinancing provides greater opportunity to pay down debt  repurchase our stock  pursue selected acquisitions or make discretionary contributions to our pension plans 
during  we reduced debt by million through the use of cash flows from operations generated primarily by the reduction of inventory by million 
the implementation of our consolidation and globalization strategy  which was designed to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs  has resulted in significant costs and will generate savings in future years

capital spending has varied significantly from year to year as we have executed our supply chain consolidation and globalization strategy and the integration and consolidation of our technology systems

the amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the floating rate senior notes interest rate hedge were frozen at the termination date and will be amortized over the original remaining term of the interest rate hedge instrument 
we are required under the senior secured credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance 
to comply with this requirement  in the first quarter of we entered into a hedging arrangement whereby we capped the libor interest rate component on million of the floating rate debt under the floating rate senior notes at  as a result of which approximately of our total debt outstanding at january  is now at a fixed rate 
we use forward exchange and option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies for a portion of our anticipated short term foreign currency denominated transactions 
cotton is the primary raw material used to manufacture many of our products 
while we have sold our yarn operations  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large scale yarn suppliers 
while we do 
table of contents employ a dollar cost averaging strategy by entering into hedging contracts from time to time in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  titled summary of significant accounting policies  to our financial statements 
the application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements  or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors  are the following sales recognition and incentives we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
note d  titled summary of significant accounting policies sales recognition and incentives  to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products 
measuring the cost of these incentives requires  in many cases  estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates 
we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information 
we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of income 
accounts receivable valuation accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling  general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a large reserve might be required 
the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts 

table of contents catalog expenses we incur expenses for printing catalogs for our products to aid in our sales efforts 
we initially record these expenses as a prepaid item and charge it against selling  general and administrative expenses over time as the catalog is used 
expenses are recognized at a rate that approximates our historical experience with regard to the timing and amount of sales attributable to a catalog distribution 
inventory valuation we carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out  or fifo  method for our inventories 
we carry obsolete  damaged  and excess inventory at the net realizable value  which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates  current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans 
because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time  there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination 
market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change  resulting in further reserve requirements 
a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item  and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded deferred taxes related to operating losses and capital loss carryforwards 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions  the amount and timing of which are uncertain  possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies 
if in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods  we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized 
an adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount 
federal income taxes are provided on that portion of our income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states and be taxable  reflecting the decisions made by us with regards to earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
in periods after the spin off  we may make different decisions as to the amount of earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions  due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements  which may impact our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate 
we periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and our informed judgment 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to  or further interpretations of  regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur  and these adjustments are included in our consolidated statements of income 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
a company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
in conjunction with the spin off  we and sara lee entered into a tax sharing agreement  which allocates responsibilities between us and sara lee for taxes and certain other tax matters 
under the tax sharing agreement  sara lee generally is liable for all us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes attributable to us with respect 
table of contents to taxable periods ending on or before september  sara lee also is liable for income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods beginning before september  and ending after september   but only to the extent those taxes are allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on september  we are generally liable for all other taxes attributable to us 
changes in the amounts payable or receivable by us under the stipulations of this agreement may impact our tax provision in any period 
under the tax sharing agreement  within days after sara lee filed its final consolidated tax return for the period that included september   sara lee was required to deliver to us a computation of the amount of deferred taxes attributable to our united states and canadian operations that would be included on our opening balance sheet as of september  as finally determined which has been done 
we have the right to participate in the computation of the amount of deferred taxes 
under the tax sharing agreement  if substituting the amount of deferred taxes as finally determined for the amount of estimated deferred taxes that were included on that balance sheet at the time of the spin off causes a decrease in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet  then sara lee will be required to pay us the amount of such decrease 
if such substitution causes an increase in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet  then we will be required to pay sara lee the amount of such increase 
for purposes of this computation  our deferred taxes are the amount of deferred tax benefits including deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards that would be recognized as assets on the company s balance sheet computed in accordance with gaap  but without regard to valuation allowances  less the amount of deferred tax liabilities including deferred tax consequences attributable to taxable temporary differences that would be recognized as liabilities on our opening balance sheet computed in accordance with gaap  but without regard to valuation allowances 
neither we nor sara lee will be required to make any other payments to the other with respect to deferred taxes 
based on our computation of the final amount of deferred taxes for our opening balance sheet as of september   the amount that is expected to be collected from sara lee based on our computation of million  which reflects a preliminary cash installment received from sara lee of  is included as a receivable in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of january  and january  we have exchanged information with sara lee in connection with this matter  but sara lee has disagreed with our computation 
in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of the tax sharing agreement  on august   we submitted the dispute to binding arbitration 
the arbitration process is ongoing  and we will continue to prosecute our claim 
we do not believe that the resolution of this dispute will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock compensation we established the omnibus incentive plan to award stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  deferred stock units  performance shares and cash to our employees  non employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees 
stock based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
estimation of stock based compensation for stock options granted  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life 
we use a combination of the volatility of our company and the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions 
we utilize the simplified method outlined in sec accounting rules to estimate expected lives for options granted 
the simplified method is used for valuing stock option grants by eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees 
we estimate forfeitures for stock 
table of contents based awards granted that are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
defined benefit pension plans for a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost  plan obligations  plan assets  and how we measure the amount of these costs  see note titled defined benefit pension plans to our consolidated financial statements 
our us qualified pension plan is approximately funded as of january  compared to funded as of january  the funded status reflects an increase in the benefit obligation due to a decrease in the discount rate used in the valuation of the liability  partially offset by an increase in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the stock market s performance during we may elect to make voluntary contributions to maintain an funded level which will avoid certain benefit payment restrictions under the pension protection act 
the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet and changes in the funded status are reflected in comprehensive income 
we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end 
we expect pension expense in of approximately million compared to million in the net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred 
gains and losses  which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions  are amortized over the average future expected life of participants 
our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows in determining the discount rate  we utilized the citigroup pension discount curve rounded to the nearest basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan 
salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans  as benefits under these plans are not frozen 
the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of january  in determining the long term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical long term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments  and the utilization of forward looking assumptions 
retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality 
the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans projected benefit obligations  all other factors being equal  is illustrated by the following 
table of contents increase decrease in projected benefit pension expense obligation decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate decrease in expected investment return increase in expected investment return trademarks and other identifiable intangibles trademarks and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives  and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives 
we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors  including the effects of demand  competition  expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows 
as of january   the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was million  of which we are amortizing the entire balance 
we anticipate that our amortization expense for will be million 
we evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
we measure a trademark s fair value using the royalty saved method 
we determine the royalty saved method by evaluating various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
the rates we use to discount cash flows are based on interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
because there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them  the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
goodwill as of january   we had million of goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we rely on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles  there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors  and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of reporting units 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 

table of contents depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at its historical cost  and we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the asset s life 
we estimate an asset s life based on historical experience  manufacturers estimates  engineering or appraisal evaluations  our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us  which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life 
our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization 
a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods 
based upon current levels of depreciation  the average remaining depreciable life of our net property other than land is five years 
we test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
we evaluate an asset s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
when we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use  we depreciate the asset s adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life 
we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for property  workers compensation and other casualty programs 
we are responsible for losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits 
this liability is based on management s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
if actual trends differ from the estimates  the financial results could be impacted 
actual trends have not differed materially from the estimates 
assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method  which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
we recognize the excess of an acquired business s cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill as discussed below under goodwill 
we use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles  consulting actuaries to determine the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans  and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims 
recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting for transfers of financial assets in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting rules for transfers of financial assets 
the new rules require greater transparency and additional disclosures for transfers of financial assets and the entity s continuing involvement with them and change the requirements for derecognizing financial assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
our risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market value  sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations 
foreign exchange risk we sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars  however  we purchase some raw materials  pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  european euro  mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar 
we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option contracts 
at january   the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  assuming a adverse change in the underlying currency price  was million 
interest rates our debt under the senior secured credit facility  floating rate senior notes and accounts receivable securitization facility bear interest at variable rates 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in market interest rates that could impact the cost of servicing our debt 
we are required under the senior secured credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance 
to comply with this requirement  in the first quarter of we entered into a hedging arrangement whereby we capped the libor interest rate component on million of the floating rate debt under the floating rate senior notes at  as a result of which approximately of our total debt outstanding at january  is now at a fixed rate 
after giving effect to these arrangements  a basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of january  would result in a change in annual interest expense of million 
we may also execute interest rate cash flow hedges in the form of caps and swaps in the future in order to mitigate our exposure to variability in cash flows for the future interest payments on a designated portion of borrowings 
commodities cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products 
while we have sold our yarn operations  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
while we attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton through employing a dollar cost averaging strategy by entering into hedging contracts from time to time  our business can be adversely affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
the cotton prices reflected in our results were cents per pound in we expect the cost of cotton included in our results to average cents per pound for the full year of the ultimate effect of these pricing levels on our earnings cannot be quantified  as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain  but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we estimate that a change of per pound in cotton prices would affect our annual raw material costs by million  at current levels of production 
the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified  as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain  but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products  such as chemicals  dyestuffs  polyester yarn and foam 
we generally purchase raw 
table of contents materials at market prices 
we estimate that a change of per barrel in the price of oil would affect our freight costs by approximately million  at current levels of usage
