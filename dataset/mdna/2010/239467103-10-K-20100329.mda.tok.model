item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s investing activities are not part of its operating business and functions as a separate segment 
the company will also engage in the short selling of stock 
when this occurs  the short position is marked to the market and this adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations 
any gain or loss is recorded for the period presented historical cost is used by the company to determine all gains and losses  and fair market value is obtained by readily available market quotes on all securities 
the company s investment goals  strategies and policies are as follows the company s investment goals are capital preservation  maintaining returns on capital with a high degree of safety and generating income from dividends and option sales to help offset operating losses 
in order to achieve these goals  the company maintains a diversified securities portfolio comprised primarily of electric utility common and preferred stocks 
the company also sells covered calls on portions of its portfolio and also sells puts on stocks it is willing to own 
it also sells uncovered calls and may have net short positions in common stock up to of the value of the portfolio 
the company s net short position may temporarily rise to of the company s portfolio without any specific action because of changes in valuation  but should not exceed this amount 
the company s investment policy is to maintain a minimum of of its portfolio in electric utilities 
the board of directors has authorized this minimum to be temporarily lowered to when company management deems it to be necessary 
investments i n utilities are primarily in electric companies 
investments in non utility stocks will generally not exceed of the value of the portfolio 
investment in speculative issues  including short sales  maximum of limited use of options to increase yearly investment income 
a 
the use of call options 
covered options can be sold up to a maximum of of the value of the portfolio 
this provides extra income in addition to dividends received from the company s investments 
the risk of this strategy is that investments may be called away  which the company may have preferred to retain 
therefore  a limitation of is placed on the amount of stock on which options can be written 
the amount of the portfolio on which options are actually written is usually between of the portfolio 
the historical turnover of the portfolio is such that the average holding period is in excess of five years for available for sale securities 
b 
the use of put options 
put options are written on stocks which the company is willing to purchase 
while the company does not have a high rate of turnover in its portfolio  there is some turnover  for example  due to preferred stocks being called back by the issuing company  or stocks being called away because call options have been written 
if the stock does not go below the put exercise price  the company records the proceeds from the sale as income 
if the put is exercised  the cost basis is reduced by the proceeds received from the sale of the put option 
there may be occasions where the cost basis of the stock is lower than the market price at the time the option is exercised 
c 
speculative short sales short options 
the company normally limits its speculative transactions to no more than of the value of the portfolio 
the company may sell uncovered calls on certain stocks 
if the stock price does not rise to the price of the call  the option is not exercised and the company records the proceeds from the sale of the call as income 
if the call is exercised  the company will have a short position in the related stock 
the company then has the choice of covering the short position  or selling a put against it 
if the put is exercised  then the short position is covered 
the company s current accounting policy is to mark to the market at the end of each quarter any short positions  and include it in the income statement 
while the company may have so called speculative positions equal to of its accounts  in actual practice the net short stock positions usually account for less than of the assets of the company 
in the event of a merger  the company will elect to receive shares in the new company if this is an option 
if the proposed merger is a cash only offer  the company will receive cash and be forced to sell the stock 
item a 
risk factors operating losses the company incurred cumulative operating losses of  during the five year period ended december  these losses have mainly resulted from ongoing expenses for marketing and research and development as the company attempts to build a market for its products 
during this same time period  the company had cumulative net income from investments of  which covered operating losses and provided the necessary funds for our continued research and development and marketing 
it is the opinion of management that the financial health of the company would have been adversely affected if our net income from investments during this time had been substantially less than losses from operations 
during the two years ended december   the company had cumulative losses after income taxes of  for the three years ended december  the company had cumulative net income after income taxes of  there is no guarantee that future income from investments will continue to completely offset operating expenses as was the case on an individual and cumulative basis for each of the three years ended december  sales of blood volume kits in the company s fiscal year ended december   the sale of blood volume kits accounted for of the company s total consolidated sales 
there were four customers hospitals that accounted for of the company s sale of blood volume kits 
management believes that the loss of any one customer would have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated business for a short period of time 
all four of these hospitals have purchased their bva equipment 
the company has not had any situations in which a hospital  after having purchased a blood volume analyzer  discontinued purchasing volumex kits 
this suggests that  when more hospitals purchase equipment  they will continue with ongoing purchase of volumex kits 
the company continues to seek new customers  so that any one hospital will represent a smaller percentage of overall sales 
in the company s fiscal year ended december   the sale of blood volume kits accounted for of the company s total consolidated sales 
there were three customers hospitals that accounted for of the company s sale of blood volume kits 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement as disclosed in our previous filings  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented a significant policy change affecting the reimbursement for all diagnostic radiopharmaceutical products and contrast agents which was effective as of january  as a result of this policy change  diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals such as daxor s volumex are no longer separately reimbursable by medicare for outpatient services 
at this time  it is still unclear if this policy change will also be implemented by private third party health insurance companies 
the reimbursement policy for hospital outpatients through december  included payment for both the cost of the procedure to perform a blood volume analysis bva and the radiopharmaceutical daxor s volumex radiopharmaceutical 
cms s policy now only includes the reimbursement for the procedure and would require the hospital to absorb the cost of the radiopharmaceutical 
there will be an upward adjustment for the procedure code to include some of the costs of the radiopharmaceutical 
however  this upward adjustment does not entirely cover the costs associated with the procedure and the radiopharmaceutical 
in response to medicare s change in its reimbursement policy for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals  daxor has lobbied cms both individually and as a member of the society of nuclear medicine s apc task force  which is a select group of representatives from industry and healthcare that represents the more than  nuclear medicine professionals in the united states 
one of the missions of the apc task force is to work directly with the cms in an attempt to amend the current policy limiting the reimbursement of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for outpatient diagnostic services 
there is no guarantee that the apc task force will be successful in their efforts to persuade the cms to amend their policy of limiting the reimbursement of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for outpatient diagnostic services 
health insurance legislation on march   the us house of representatives passed the patient protection and affordable care act hr 
this legislation was signed into law by president obama on march  the goal of this legislation is to make healthcare more accessable to americans 
at this time we are unable to quantify how this legislation will affect our operating income 
although it is possible that increased coverage could lead to greater access to our products and services if the reimbursement rate is lower  this would limit the benefit to daxor and could have a negative impact on our operating results and our business 
available for sale securities at december   of the fair market value of the company s investment portfolio consisted of utility stocks whose market price can be sensitive to rising interest rates 
at december   of the company s investment portfolio consisted of utility stocks 
the company s investment policy calls for a minimum of of the investment portfolio to consist of utility stocks 
the board of directors has authorized this minimum to be temporarily lowered to when management deems it to be necessary 
at march   june  and september  the percentage of the company s investment portfolio which consisted of utility stocks was  and respectively 
at december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of separate stocks 
the top three holdings as of this date in the investment portfolio were entergy corporation  first energy corporation and exelon 
these three holdings comprised of the value of the investment portfolio and also accounted for of the dividend income for the year ended december  a reduction in dividend payments by these companies could have a material effect on the company s dividend income 
the company also receives significant income from option sales related to its investment portfolio 
the income from options is variable  and less predictable than income from dividends from the company s portfolio  which have minor variations 
the ability of the company to sell options is related to the market value of its available for sale securities 
if there is a decrease in the market value of the company available for sale securities  this could negatively impact income from option sales 
there is a risk that in an environment of rising interest rates that the market value of these stocks could decline and the utilities could reduce their dividend payments to compensate for increased interest expense 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to fund research and development and marketing efforts necessary to build a market for our products 
investment company in and  the company and dr

there is a risk that the sec may attempt to designate daxor as an investment company under the investment company act 
key individual the company has a significant dependence on a single individual  dr 
joseph feldschuh  who is the ceo of the company 
dr 
feldschuh is the chief scientist of the company and is believed to have more experience with blood volume measurement than any other physician in the united states 
he is involved in assisting and advising various physician groups that are conducting research 
his scientific knowledge would be difficult to replace 
dr 
feldschuh is also the sole individual responsible for investment decisions with respect to the company s investment portfolio 
the loss of his services in this area would be expected to result in a material reduction in return on the company s assets 
patents our patents for the bva expire in may we are in the process of developing an automated system for measuring total body albumin  which we will incorporate into the next generation of blood volume analyzers when we apply for a new patent 
it is difficult to determine when or if our application for a new patent would be approved 
the blood volume analyzer  however  works most efficiently with the tracer injection kit system which has a separate patent and which expires in it is possible that another company could develop another version of the blood volume analyzer which would use a different tracer injection kit 
to the best of our knowledge  this has not happened yet and management views the development of a competing tracer injection kit as unlikely 
volumex syringes all of the company s orders for volumex syringes are filled by a single fda approved radio pharmaceutical manufacturer 
this manufacturer is the only one approved by the fda in the united states to manufacture volumex for interstate commerce 
if this manufacturer were to cease filling the volumex syringes for daxor before the company had a chance to make alternative arrangements  the effect on daxor s operating revenue could be material 
regulatory risk or approvals there is a risk of delay until regulatory approvals are received for any new products the company may attempt to bring to market in the future 
at this point  management is unable to assess how long such a delay would be or the effect on sales that it could have

investing segment unrealized losses on available for sale securities at december   or  of the total unrealized losses of  was comprised of the following three securities  for citigroup inc citigroup   for usec usec  inc and  for dynegy  inc 
dynegy 
citigroup inc at december   daxor owned  shares of citigroup with a cost basis of per share and a market value of per share 
on march   the market value of citigroup was per share which is or less than our cost basis of per share 
during the first quarter of  the stock was at per share and as of march   was trading at over per share 
the stock price has increased by from january  through march  citigroup  which is the core part of the business  earned billion in versus billion in despite difficult market conditions caused by a recessionary business environment 
this division represents of citigroup s total assets and of their deposits 
also  their revenue from securities and banking increased by in versus and total deposits on hand were higher at december  versus december  citigroup has reduced headcount to  at december  versus  at the peak level in operating expenses during the fourth quarter of were billion versus billion in the fourth quarter of and billion in the fourth quarter of the charges for do not include goodwill impairment 
during  citigroup repaid billion of tarp troubled asset relief program trust preferred securities and exited a loss sharing agreement 
as a result of these transactions  effective in  citigroup is no longer deemed to be a beneficiary of exceptional financial assistance under tarp 
as of december   the united states treasury department owned of citigroup s stock 
in order to be well capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions  a bank holding company must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least  and not be subject to a federal reserve board directive to maintain higher capital levels 
at december   the tier capital was  total capital was and leverage was 
citigroup is considered well capitalized under the federal regulatory agency definitions at year end 
the operating environment for citigroup continues to be difficult but the stock price has been trending upward since the first quarter of and the profit of the core business more than doubled in versus management at citigroup has substantially reduced operating expenses and headcount which should help operating results in future periods 
citigroup is no longer deemed to be a beneficiary of exceptional financial assistance under tarp and is considered to be well capitalized under the federal regulatory agency definitions at december  after considering the available positive and negative evidence in addition to the ability of daxor to hold the stock until the market price exceeds our cost  management has determined that an impairment charge is not necessary at december  on citigroup 
usec  inc at december   daxor owned  shares of usec with a cost basis of per share and a market value of per share 
on march   the market value of usec was per share which is or less than our cost basis of per share 
during the past year  usec has been as low as per share and as high as which is above our cost basis of per share 
the market value of the stock has increased by from january  through march  as of december  the book value of usec was per share which is substantially higher than our cost basis 
usec is a leading supplier of low enriched uranium for commercial nuclear power plants 
low enriched uranium is a critical component in the production of nuclear fuel for reactors to produce electricity 
usec is now in the process of deploying what their management anticipates will be the world s most advanced uranium enrichment technology  known as american centrifuge 
there are currently nuclear reactors in operation globally and new reactors are under construction worldwide and applications to build as many as new reactors in the united states are now being reviewed by the nuclear regulatory commission 
according to the world nuclear association wna  additional reactors are on order or planned and another have been proposed 
it is expected that the global emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions will provide strong incentive for utilities to build nuclear power stations 
the wna expects demand for uranium enrichment to roughly double over the next two decades as new reactors become operational 
there is still a lower growth forecast for electric power demand due to the recession that began in and lower prices for alternative fuels 
it is possible that this will slow the need for new nuclear power capacity and the cost estimates for new reactors have also risen substantially in recent years 
however  it is also likely that population growth and increasing per capita demand for electric power  especially in emerging markets and environmental concerns favoring the use of nuclear power will provide a strong foundation to increase future demand for nuclear power 
daxor management feels that usec s positions as a supplier of low enriched uranium combined with their deployment of advanced uranium enrichment technology has them well positioned to take advantage of what should be growing demand in the future for nuclear power despite the current difficult economic climate 
the stock price has increased by since january  and is still trading at a substantial discount to book value 
after considering the available positive and negative evidence in addition to the ability of daxor to hold the stock until the market price exceeds our cost  daxor management has determined that an impairment charge is not necessary at december  on usec 
dynegy  inc at december   daxor owned  shares of dynegy with a cost basis of per share and a market value of per share 
on march   the market price of dynegy was per share which is or lower than our cost basis of per share 
the book value of dynegy at december  is per share which is almost double our cost basis of per share 
the stock price of dynegy has a record of volatility  being at per share in february  as low as in march before going back to per share in october dynegy s liquidity improved from billion at december  to billion at february  the liquidity at february  consisted of million in cash on hand and billion in unused availability under the company s credit facility 
the cash balance increased from million at december  to million at february  due to increased cash inflows from the company s collateral clearing agent due to lower commodity prices 
in  dynegy was able to repurchase approximately million of bonds due in and which largely eliminated near term bond maturities until dynegy reported a loss of billion in after a profit of million in and million in the loss in is largely due to assets which were sold at a loss 
the price of energy has declined since the summer of which reflects a similar decline in natural gas prices and the impact of general economic conditions 
however  dynegy management believes that over the long term  power demand and pricing will increase 
dynegy recently reported that they spent million to cut emissions of pollutants at its power plants in illinois and that the total investment for this project should be approximately billion 
this work has been completed at five out of its eight coal fired units in illinois 
dynegy is also switching to low sulfur coal and expects their coal fired plants in illinois to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides  sulfur dioxide and mercury by approximately 
dynegy has low cost power generation plants spread across seven states which use coal  oil and natural gas 
the generating capacity is geographically diverse with in the midwest  in the west and in the northeast 
this geographic diversity prevents the company from becoming too dependent on one part of the country 
the generating capacity is also diverse with from natural gas fired combined cycle capacity  from natural gas fired peaking capacity  from baseload coal oil capacity and from dual fuel capacity 
this diversity of generating capacity helps to minimize the impact of any potential volatility in commodity prices 
it is expected that as future demand increases  prices for power will increase accordingly and this should lead to a return to profitability for dynegy 
daxor management has determined that an impairment charge is not necessary at december  on dynegy after taking the recent decline in the stock price into account because dynegy is a geographically diverse low cost producer of electricity with a diverse generating capacity 
these two factors protect the company from being overly dependent on one region of the country or one type of commodity 
the stock price of dynegy has decreased by since january  however  the stock does have a history of volatile price fluctuations and it was trading as high as in october of the recent market price is well below the book value of per share at december  which would seem to indicate that the stock is strongly undervalued 
the recent repurchase of bonds and improved liquidity position have also helped to strengthen dynegy s balance sheet

the main reasons for this decrease are that the company had the following realized losses in  on  shares of dynegy   on  shares of usec and  on  shares of bank of america common stock 
the shares of dynegy and usec were sold in order to generate tax savings and lower the cost basis on the remaining  shares of dynegy and  shares of usec still in the company s portfolio of available for sale securities at december  the company did not own any bank of america common stock at december  for the year ended december   gains on the sale of investments were  the sum of dividend income plus investment gain from sale of securities was  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  versus  at december  cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to funding the operating loss for the current year

based on present conditions  it is unlikely that additional capital can be raised on reasonable terms without significant dilution to existing shareholders 
the company believes that if the blood volume analyzer becomes a standard of care in any one of the areas described in this k filing  it will then have much easier access to additional capital 
the company s investment portfolio has been a critical source of supplemental income which has offset the cumulative operating losses for the five year period ended december  without the income from the investment portfolio  the company would have needed to raise additional operating funds through either debt or equity financing or a combination of the two

critical accounting policies available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt and equity securities primarily common and preferred stock of utility companies that management has determined meet the definition of available for sale under fasb asc  investments 
accordingly  these investments are stated at fair market value and all unrealized holding gains or losses are recorded in the stockholders equity section as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
conversely  all realized gains  losses and earnings are recorded in the statement of operations under other income expense 
the company will also engage in the short selling of stock 
when this occurs  the short position is marked to the market and this adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations 
any gain or loss is recorded for the period presented historical cost is used by the company to determine all gains and losses  and fair market value is obtained by readily available market quotes on all securities 
the company s investment goals  strategies and policies are as follows the company s investment goals are capital preservation  maintaining returns on capital with a high degree of safety and generating income from dividends and option sales to help offset operating losses 
in order to achieve these goals  the company maintains a diversified securities portfolio comprised primarily of electric utility common and preferred stocks 
the company also sells covered calls on portions of its portfolio and also sells puts on stocks it is willing to own 
it also sells uncovered calls and may have net short positions in common stock up to of the value of the portfolio 
the company s net short position may temporarily rise to of the company s portfolio without any specific action because of changes in valuation  but should not exceed this amount 
the company s investment policy is to maintain a minimum of of its portfolio in electric utilities 
the board of directors has authorized this minimum to be temporarily lowered to when company management deems it to be necessary 
investments i n utilities are primarily in electric companies 
investments in non utility stocks will generally not exceed of the value of the portfolio 
investment in speculative issues  including short sales  maximum of limited use of options to increase yearly investment income 
a 
the use of call options 
covered options can be sold up to a maximum of of the value of the portfolio 
this provides extra income in addition to dividends received from the company s investments 
the risk of this strategy is that investments may be called away  which the company may have preferred to retain 
therefore  a limitation of is placed on the amount of stock on which options can be written 
the amount of the portfolio on which options are actually written is usually between of the portfolio 
the historical turnover of the portfolio is such that the average holding period is in excess of five years for available for sale securities 
b 
the use of put options 
put options are written on stocks which the company is willing to purchase 
while the company does not have a high rate of turnover in its portfolio  there is some turnover  for example  due to preferred stocks being called back by the issuing company  or stocks being called away because call options have been written 
if the stock does not go below the put exercise price  the company records the proceeds from the sale as income 
if the put is exercised  the cost basis is reduced by the proceeds received from the sale of the put option 
there may be occasions where the cost basis of the stock is lower than the market price at the time the option is exercised 
c 
speculative short sales short options 
the company normally limits its speculative transactions to no more than of the value of the portfolio 
the company may sell uncovered calls on certain stocks 
if the stock price does not rise to the price of the call  the option is not exercised and the company records the proceeds from the sale of the call as income 
if the call is exercised  the company will have a short position in the related stock 
the company then has the choice of covering the short position  or selling a put against it 
if the put is exercised  then the short position is covered 
the company s current accounting policy is to mark to the market at the end of each quarter any short positions  and include it in the income statement 
while the company may have so called speculative positions equal to of its accounts  in actual practice the net short stock positions usually account for less than of the assets of the company 
in the event of a merger  the company will elect to receive shares in the new company if this is an option 
if the proposed merger is a cash only offer  the company will receive cash and be forced to sell the stock 
our investment policy calls for a minimum of of the value of our portfolio of available for sale securities to be maintained in utility stocks 
operating under this policy  management s investment strategy is to purchase utility stocks which it considers to be undervalued relative to the market in anticipation of an increase in the market price 
it is possible that the market value of a stock may go below our cost after we purchase it even though we considered the stock to be undervalued relative to the market at the time we purchased it 
when that occurs  we follow the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin codification of staff accounting bulletins  topic m sab m miscellaneous accounting  other than temporary investments in debt and equity securities in determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
the factors we review and or consider include the following the extent to which the market value has been less than cost 
an evaluation of the financial condition of an issuer including a review of their profit and loss statements for the most recent completed fiscal year and the preceding two years 
the examination of the general market outlook of the issuer 
this could include but is not limited to the issuer having a unique product or technology which would appear likely to have a positive impact on future earnings 
a review of the general market conditions 
our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value 
specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of  and business outlook for  the issuer 
changes in technology in the industry and its affect on the issuer changes in the issuer s credit rating
