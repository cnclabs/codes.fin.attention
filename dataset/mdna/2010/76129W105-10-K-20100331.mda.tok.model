forward looking statement warning certain statements included by reference in this filing containing the words could  may  believes  anticipates  intends  expects  and similar such words constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
any forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  our ability to maintain liquidity  our maintenance of patent protection  the impact of current litigation as it affects our costs as well as market access  our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  our ability to receive royalties from btmd  our ability to quickly 
table of contents increase capacity in response to an increase in demand  our ability to access the market  our ability to maintain or lower production costs  our ability to continue to finance research and development as well as operations and expansion of production  the increased interest of larger market players  specifically bd  in providing devices to the safety market  and other factors referenced in item a 
risk factors 
given these uncertainties  undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements 
overview we have been manufacturing and marketing our products into the marketplace since we currently provide other safety medical products in addition to safety syringe products 
one such product is the patient safe syringe  which is uniquely designed to reduce the risk of bloodstream infections resulting from catheter hub contamination 
patient safe s unique luer guard reduces the risk of luer tip contact contamination and the risk of contamination of intravenous fluid 
safety syringes comprised of our sales in historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
we expect the swine flu to have a longer worldwide immunization duration than the seasonal flu 
in the third quarter of  we were awarded a contract by the dhhs to supply a portion of the safety engineered syringes to be used in the us efforts to vaccinate the us population against the swine flu 
the impact on us was material 
sales to the dhhs comprised and of our revenues for the three months and twelve months ended december   respectively 
this program  which was estimated to run from august through march  ended in december our revenue increased in the fourth quarter principally due to the dhhs contract 
we do not know if there will be a similar program in our products have been and continue to be distributed nationally through numerous distributors 
however  we have been blocked from access to the market by exclusive marketing practices engaged in by bd  which dominates the market 
we believe that its monopolistic business practices continue despite i its paying million in to settle a prior lawsuit with us for anticompetitive practices  business disparagement  and tortious interference and ii the fact that a jury returned a verdict in november finding that all three patents asserted by us against bd are valid and infringed by bd with regard to its integratm product 
although we have made limited progress in some areas  such as the alternate care and international markets  our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our products and the federal and state legislation requiring the use of safe needle devices 
we continue to pursue various strategies to have better access to the hospital market  as well as other markets  including attempting to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  our innovative technology  introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 
we are also marketing more products internationally 
we sued omi in april and separately sued bd in june for claims of patent infringement see item legal proceedings  and in december and november  respectively  such companies were found to infringe our patents 
these judgments could increase demand for our product 
however  there is no assurance when or if such increase will occur 
beginning in  we were given an award from path to supply syringes to various african countries under the president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar 
awards increased significantly from to the continuation of pepfar has been reauthorized by congress through however  funding for the procurement of safety syringes in this program has not occurred to date 
as a result of the introduction of vanishpoint syringes through the pepfar initiative  african countries have begun to procure products outside of the us funded program 
in  the director general of nigeria s national agency for food and drug administration and control nafdac  endorsed automated retraction syringes for use throughout nigeria 
we are currently selling syringes to a nigerian distributor for use in that country 
at the end of  the deputy prime minister of namibia also publically endorsed automated retraction syringes as a public intervention that would protect health workers and save their patient s lives 

table of contents the number of international distributors continues to increase 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access  the cash provided by the litigation settlements and generated from operations becomes insufficient  and royalties from btmd are not forthcoming  we would take additional cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
we took such actions at the end of the second quarter of at the end of the second quarter of  we announced that in the interest of the long term survival of the company we would reorganize some of the company s functions and implement staff reductions  all in order to minimize our cash expenditures and conserve our resources 
our workforce was reduced by on july  however  due to the expected increase in production from sales to dhhs  we increased the workforce at the little elm facility beginning in the latter part of the third quarter of the rehiring only slightly affected our prior estimate that annual compensation costs and related expenses would be reduced by million annually due to the layoffs 
an anticipated reduction of inventory was estimated at the time of the announcement to result in a minimum of million reduction in cash outlays over the subsequent twelve months 
however  due to the orders from the dhhs  that particular initiative is on hold 
our president and ceo  thomas j 
shaw  waived future royalty payments beginning july   for an aggregate savings of million which affected royalty payments not expenses in the third and fourth quarter of salaries for all personnel above a certain salary level were cut by in subject to contract rights 
such reduction  along with discontinuing the k matching  was estimated to save  we expect to save an additional million by the following actions moving most  if not all  of the molding of piece parts back to little elm  reducing professional fees  and various other cost cutting measures 
professional fees have been reduced and we have begun additional molding in little elm 
these measures will remain in place as long as management deems them necessary 
we recorded a  charge in the second quarter of for severance pay offered to the terminated employees 
all severance payments were paid in the third quarter of we incurred a noncash expense of million related to the issuance of stock options  most of which will be fully amortized by the third quarter of we wrote off approximately million in development costs related to the catheters 
we are focusing on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
we believe our current capitalization provides the resources necessary to implement some of these changes and improve our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  thereby reducing our unit cost 
product purchases from double dove  a chinese manufacturer  have enabled us to increase manufacturing capacity with little capital outlay and have provided a competitive manufacturing cost 
in  double dove manufactured approximately of the units we produced 
the cost of production per unit has generally declined as volumes increased 
we believe we could make up any long term disruption in these supplies by utilizing more of the capacity at the little elm facility  except for the ml insulin syringe  the ml and ml syringes  and the autodisable syringe which altogether comprised about of our revenues 
we previously entered into a license agreement with btmd as of may  that license expired on may  prior to the manufacture and delivery of any products 
nevertheless  btmd continued to work toward completing the facility and gaining the necessary approvals in order to manufacture and sell products 
the facility has been completed and btmd has met chinese government requirements 
btmd received a registration certificate for medical device on august  production efforts are currently underway and are being tested 
we entered into a new agreement effective as of july  with btmd along similar terms as the prior agreement 
this agreement expires on july  which may automatically extend under certain conditions 
such terms include granting to btmd a limited exclusive license to manufacture and a limited exclusive right to sell syringes in the prc having retractable needles that incorporate our technology 
this license agreement is subject to the technology license agreement dated june  between mr 
thomas j 
shaw  our founder and ceo  as licensor  and the company  as licensee as amended 
accordingly  mr 
shaw will receive of the licensing proceeds we receive 
btmd has agreed to manufacture and sell these products in the prc and to pay us a quarterly royalty of two and one half cents per unit on ml and ml syringes and a royalty of three and one half cents per unit on ml  ml  and ml syringes 
the obligation to pay the royalties continues even if 
table of contents any and all of our patent rights in the prc are found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason 
we still continue to expect royalty payments although we are unable to predict the date we will begin to receive such royalties 
with increased volumes  our manufacturing unit costs have generally tended to decline 
factors that could affect our unit costs include increases in costs by third party manufacturers  changing production volumes  costs of petroleum products  and transportation costs 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
we completed the expansion of an existing warehouse in the first quarter of this expansion increased our warehouse area  provided for additional office space  and added a second controlled environment 
the additional controlled environment will enable us to do more molding in house 
liquidity at the present time  management does not intend to raise equity capital 
due to the funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
historical sources of liquidity we have historically funded operations primarily from the proceeds from revenues  private placements  loans  and litigation settlements 
internal sources of liquidity margins and market access to achieve break even quarters  we need minimal access to hospital markets which has been difficult to obtain due to the monopolistic marketplace which was the subject of our initial lawsuit and now also included in our second anti trust lawsuit against bd 
we will continue to attempt to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  innovative technology  the introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation

sales to the dhhs comprised and of our revenues for the three months and twelve months ended december   respectively 
this program  which was estimated to run from august through march  ended in december our revenue increased in the fourth quarter principally due to the dhhs contract 
we do not know if there will be a similar program in beginning in early  we began to receive shipment of product from double dove which enabled us to lower our unit costs 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all as opposed to of our products in the us this could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production 
the mix of domestic and international sales affects the average sales price of our products 
generally  the higher the ratio of domestic sales to international sales  the higher the average sales price will be 
typically international sales are shipped directly from china to the customer 
purchases of product manufactured in china  if available  usually decrease the average cost of manufacture for all units as domestic costs  such as indirect labor and overhead  remain relatively constant 
the number of units produced by the company versus manufactured in china can have a significant effect on the carrying costs of inventory as well as cost of sales 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriate mix of products manufactured domestically and those manufactured in china to achieve economic 
table of contents benefits as well as to maintain our domestic manufacturing capability 
currently  approximately of our products are produced domestically 
fluctuations in the cost of oil since our products are petroleum based and transportation and the volume of units purchased from double dove may have an impact on the unit costs of our product 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
reductions in oil prices may not quickly affect petroleum product prices 
seasonality historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
we expect the swine flu to have a longer worldwide immunization duration than the seasonal flu

such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
external sources of liquidity we have obtained several loans from our inception  which have  together with the proceeds from the sales of equities and litigation efforts  enabled us to pursue development and production of our products 
given the current economic conditions  our ability to obtain additional funds through loans is uncertain 
furthermore  the shareholders previously authorized an additional  shares of a class c preferred stock that could  if necessary  be designated and used to raise funds through the sale of equity 
due to the current market price of our common stock  it is unlikely we would choose to raise funds by the sale of equity 
we obtained a loan from st international for  secured by the land and existing buildings  which provided funding for the construction of the  square foot warehouse placed in service in this loan had a maturity date in late march we anticipate refinancing this loan 

table of contents capital resources material commitments for expenditures on august   we obtained a  interim construction loan from lewisville state bank  a division of st international bank 
the purpose of the loan was to expand the warehouse  including additional office space  and construct a new controlled environment 
the interest rate was wsjpr plus 
the loan was renewed on december  with a year amortization and year maturity 
the interest rate is 
the construction project has been completed 
trends in capital resources interest expense will increase due to the recent loan of approximately million  but will be somewhat mitigated by lower borrowing rates if current conditions in the credit markets continue 
interest income may be negatively affected by lower interest rates and our prior movement of cash to us treasury bills and other us government backed securities 
although we believe that we have granted credit to credit worthy firms  current economic conditions may affect the timing and or collectability of some accounts 
results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from our historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
all period references are to our fiscal years ended december   or dollar amounts have been rounded for ease of reading 
comparison of year ended december   and year ended december  revenues increased  due principally to sales under the dhhs contract 
domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder 
without the dhhs contract  our revenues would have increased  with domestic revenues increasing and international revenues declining 
unit sales of the ml syringe increased and ml unit sales increased 
unit sales of all products increased 
domestic unit sales as well as average sales prices increased 
international unit sales decreased slightly and average selling prices increased 
sales to two customers accounted for of our revenues in only one of these two customers was a customer in  and such customer accounted for of our revenues in cost of sales increased due to greater volumes 
royalty expenses were higher due to higher gross sales 
as a result  gross profit margins increased from in to in operating expenses increased from the prior year due to litigation costs and stock option expense mitigated by the cost cutting measures beginning in the third quarter of sales and marketing expenses decreased due primarily to lower compensation due to staff reduction and reduction in pay  lower advertising expenses and reduced travel costs 
stock option expense and consulting costs increased 
research and development costs were lower 
we had decreases in engineering costs due principally to reduction in staff and pay as well as lower consulting cost 
stock option expense increased 
general and administrative costs increased due principally to litigation costs and stock option expense 
compensation costs decreased due to staff reductions and reductions in pay 
preferred stock dividend requirements decreased slightly due to conversion of preferred stock in the first quarter of the dividend arrearage at december   on all classes of preferred stock was approximately million 

table of contents interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and lower cash balances 
interest expense decreased due to capitalized interest 
interest expense is expected to increase in due to completion of significant capital projects in for which interest was being capitalized 
cash flow from operations was a negative million for due principally to operating losses and increases in receivables 
most of the increase in receivables was related to billings in december to dhhs and collected in january the increase in income taxes receivable is related to a refund for carryback of our net operating loss 
we will file for this refund early in the second quarter of the effect of non cash expenses and the change in working capital was a negative million 
investing activities utilized million in cash 
comparison of year ended december   and year ended december  revenues increased  due principally to higher average sales prices and greater volumes 
domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder 
unit sales of the ml syringe increased and ml unit sales decreased 
unit sales of all products increased 
domestic unit sales as well as average sales prices increased 
international unit sales and average selling prices declined 
sales to one distributor accounted for and of our revenues in and  respectively 
cost of sales increased due to higher manufacturing costs and higher volumes 
royalty expenses were higher due to an increase in gross revenues 
as a result  gross profit margins declined from in to in operating expenses increased from the prior year due to higher general and administrative expenses mitigated by lower sales and marketing and research and development costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased due primarily to reduced travel and entertainment  trade shows and market expense  compensation and office supplies 
consulting expense also decreased 
research and development costs were flat 
we had decreases in engineering costs due principally to higher costs of validation and engineering samples offset by higher compensation costs 
general and administrative costs increased due principally to increased legal costs including a settlement of litigation whereby we obtained a patent license assignment  office expenses  compensation  property taxes and freight costs 
travel and entertainment costs and fees to distributors decreased 
preferred stock dividend requirements decreased due to conversion of preferred stock to common stock 
the dividend arrearage at december   on all classes of preferred stock was approximately million 
interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and cash balances 
interest expense decreased due to lower interest rates mitigated by higher debt balances and capitalized interest  principally due to the construction of the warehouse 
other accrued liabilities increased due to prepayments from international customers 
cash flow from operations was a negative million for due principally to our losses 
the effect of non cash expenses and the change in working capital was a positive million 
investing activities utilized million in cash 
off balance sheet arrangements none 

table of contents contractual obligations contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following chart summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for long term debt as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current maturities these amounts do not reflect the effect of the beneficial conversion feature and therefore will be greater than the amounts in the financial statements 
significant accounting policies we consider the following to be our most significant accounting policies 
careful consideration and review is given to these and all accounting policies on a routine basis to ensure that they are accurately and consistently applied 
accounts receivable we record trade receivables when revenue is recognized 
no product has been consigned to customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables 
those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance 
an additional allowance has been established based on a percentage of receivables outstanding 
these provisions are reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible 
trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for sales to distributors when title and risk of ownership passes to the distributor  generally upon shipment 
revenue is recorded on the basis of sales price to distributors  less contractual pricing allowances 
contractual pricing allowances consist of i rebates granted to distributors who provide tracking reports which show  among other things  the facility that purchased the products  and ii a provision for estimated contractual pricing allowances for products that we have not received tracking reports 
rebates are recorded when issued and are applied against the customer s receivable balance 
the provision for contractual pricing allowances is reviewed at the end of each quarter and adjusted for changes in levels of products for which there is no tracking report 
additionally  if it becomes clear that tracking reports will not be provided by individual distributors  the provision is further adjusted 
the estimated contractual allowance is netted against individual distributors accounts receivable balances for financial reporting purposes 
the resulting net balance is reflected in accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
the terms and conditions of contractual pricing allowances are governed by contracts between us and our distributors 
revenue for shipments directly to end users is recognized when title and risk of ownership passes from us 
any product shipped or distributed for evaluation purposes is expensed 
our domestic return policy is set forth in our standard distribution agreement 
this policy provides that a customer may return incorrect shipments within days following arrival at the distributor s facility 
in all such cases the distributor must obtain an authorization code from us and affix the code to the returned product 
we will not accept returned goods without a returned goods authorization number 
we may refund the customer s money or replace the product minus a restocking fee and all applicable freight charges 
our return policy also provides that a customer may return product that is overstocked 
overstocking returns are limited to two times in each month period up to of distributor s total purchase of products for the prior month period 
all product overstocks and returns are subject to inspection and acceptance by manufacturer 

table of contents our international distribution agreements do not provide for any returns 
we record an allowance for estimated returns as a reduction to accounts receivable and gross sales 
historically  returns have been less than of net sales 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using actual average cost 
a reserve is established for any excess or obsolete inventories 
marketing fees under a sales and marketing agreement with abbott  we paid marketing fees until we terminated the contract for breach 
the contracted services were to include participation in promotional activities  development of educational and promotional materials  representation at trade shows  clinical demonstrations  inservicing and training  and tracking reports detailing the placement of our products to end users 
marketing fees were accrued at the time of the sale of product to abbott 
these fees were paid after abbott provided us a tracking report of product sales to end users 
these costs were included in sales and marketing expense in the statements of operations 
no marketing fees have been accrued since october   the date the national marketing and distribution agreement with abbott was terminated 
we filed suit against abbott in august for breach of contract and trial is scheduled for may we do not expect the eventual liability for marketing fees  if any  to exceed the amount accrued 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposures regarding our cash and cash equivalents are immaterial as we do not have instruments for trading purposes 
we shifted the bulk of our funds into us treasury bills and other us government backed securities in april additionally  reasonable  possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material changes in near term losses in earnings
