item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent exploration and production company focused on natural gas shale plays in the appalachian and illinois basins 
we also operate the gas gathering facilities for our core properties  providing deliverability directly from the wellhead to interstate pipelines serving major east coast natural gas markets 
we develop many of our prospects with participation from sponsored drilling partnerships  maintaining combined interests as both general partner and an investor ranging from to  along with additional reversionary interests after specified distribution thresholds are reached 
we account for those interests using the proportionate consolidation method  with all material inter company accounts and transactions eliminated on consolidation 
results of operations and revenues 
the following table shows the components of our revenues for and  together with their percentages of total revenue in and percentage change on a year over year basis 
year ended december  of revenue revenue change contract drilling oil and gas production gas transmission  compression and processing total our total revenues for reflect the impact of declining commodity prices  reduced drilling activity and the third quarter sale of our appalachian gathering system  which also eliminated our cost savings from ownership of these facilities 
in view of our current business model for maintaining capital expenditures in line with operating cash flows  we do not expect this trend to reverse without a significant recovery in commodity prices or increased participation by sponsored partnerships in our drilling activities 
contract drilling revenues reflect the size and timing of our drilling partnership initiatives 
although we receive the proceeds from private placements in sponsored partnerships as prepayments under our drilling contracts  revenues from the interests of outside investors are recognized on the completed contract method as the wells are drilled  rather than when funds are received 
our contract drilling revenues in reflect the challenging economic environment  which contributed to a reduction in the size of our drilling partnership compared to the prior year s program 
with a raise of million  the partnership is participating in horizontal wells  of which four wells are being drilled during the first quarter 
production revenues for reflect year over year declines of in natural gas prices  in oil prices and for sales of natural gas liquids 
the impact of weak commodity prices was partially offset by an increase of in production output to  mmcfe  compared to  mmcfe in the prior year 
our volumetric growth reflects our transition to horizontal drilling throughout our operated properties in during the year  approximately of our natural gas production was sold under fixed price physical delivery contracts  and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices 
realized natural gas prices in averaged per mcf for our appalachian production and per mcf overall  compared to an average overall realization of per mcf in the contraction of gas transmission  compression and processing revenues was driven by our sale of the appalachian gathering system in the third quarter of see business and properties recent developments 
following the sale  our gas transmission  compression and processing revenues were limited primarily to fees for moving third party production through our retained gas gathering facilities  gas utility sales and our share of third party fees for liquids extraction through our rogersville plant  which we continue to co own with seminole energy 
expenses 
the following table shows the components of our direct and other expenses for and percentages listed in the table reflect margins for each component of direct expenses and percentages of total revenue for each component of other expenses

these expenses represented of contract drilling revenues in  compared to in the prior year 
margins for contract drilling operations reflect our cost plus pricing model  which we adopted in to address price volatility for drilling services  equipment and steel casing requirements 
production expenses represent lifting costs  field operating and maintenance expenses  related overhead  severance and other production taxes  third party transportation fees and processing costs 
historically  our ownership of the appalachian gathering system eliminated transportation costs for our share of leatherwood  straight creek  fonde and stone mountain production delivered through the system 
the increase in production expenses year over year primarily reflects higher transportation costs following our sale of the appalachian gathering system in the third quarter of our gas transmission and compression expenses  as well as capitalized costs for this part of our business  were substantially reduced following our sale of the appalachian gathering system 
our remaining infrastructure position is comprised of interests in the gas gathering facilities for our haley s mill and kay jay fields  interests in our haley s mill and rogersville processing plants and a interest in the gathering system for our non operated arkoma properties 
our gas transmission  compression and processing expenses in future periods will reflect this reduction in our infrastructure asset base 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised primarily of selling and promotional costs for our sponsored drilling partnerships and general overhead costs 
our sg a expenses decreased by year over year  primarily from the decline in partnership sales 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses increased from in to in non cash charges for options  warrants and deferred compensation reflect the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options 
under this method  employee stock options are valued at the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  and the compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
we also recognized an accrual of  for deferred compensation cost in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a is recognized under the units of production method  based on the estimated proved developed reserves of the underlying oil and gas properties  and on a straight line basis over the useful life of other property and equipment 
the increase in dd a charges reflects additions to our oil and gas properties from drilling initiatives  partially offset by a reduction in historical depletion costs for the appalachian gathering system following its sale in the third quarter of cash interest expense in decreased year over year  reflecting the reduction of debt levels under our revolving credit facility from proceeds of our infrastructure monetization and equity raise in the third quarter of non cash interest expense of  reflects the application of the effective interest method for accretion of the debt discount for the embedded conversion feature of our notes  which had a face amount of million prior to the restructuring of our convertible debt in january see liquidity and capital resources 
the carrying amount of the exchange notes issued in the restructuring will be reduced by the initial fair values of the equity components of the exchange transaction 
the resulting debt discount will be amortized to interest expense though the conversion or repayment dates of exchange notes and the expiration or exercise dates of the warrants 
we recognized pre tax gains totaling  during  primarily from our sale of the appalachian gathering system 
we acquired the open access portion of the system from duke energy in march for million and built out the field wide infrastructure at historical costs totaling approximately million 
deferred income tax expense recognized in both reporting periods represents future tax liabilities at the operating company level 
although we generally have no current tax liability at that level due to the utilization of deductions primarily for intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion  our consolidated income tax expense is negatively impacted by the non recognition of tax benefits at the parent company level 
for  we had an income tax benefit of  from our operating loss 
other expenses in totaled  net of minor income items 
the recorded expenses include payments and accruals totaling  for various guaranteed obligations of a virginia steam company in which we previously held a interest 
we have also accrued  for the unreimbursed part of a personal injury litigation settlement reached in march  which we will seek to recoup under our umbrella liability insurance coverage 
net income loss and eps 
we recognized a net loss of  in  reflecting the foregoing factors

results of operations and revenues 
the following table shows the components of our revenues for and  together with their percentages of total revenue in and percentage change on a year over year basis 
year ended december  of revenue revenue change contract drilling oil and gas production gas transmission  compression and processing total contract drilling revenues reflect the application of prepayments by outside investors under our drilling contracts with sponsored partnerships  which we recognize under the completed contract method as the wells are drilled 
during  we sponsored a program for participation in wells on non operated properties known as the hre fields  spanning six counties in west virginia and virginia 
our contract drilling revenues in reflect ongoing operations for that program and the completion of our hre program 
outside investors have interests of before payout and after payout in both of those programs 
the growth in our production revenues for reflects a increase in production output to  mmcfe  compared to  mmcfe in our volumetric growth was driven by added production from wells brought on line during  including substantial contributions from our horizontal drilling initiatives 
approximately of our natural gas production in was sold under fixed price contracts  and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices 
realized natural gas prices in averaged per mcf for our appalachian production and per mcf overall  compared to an average overall realization of per mcf in gas transmission  compression and processing revenues for were driven by gas gathering and compression fees totaling  for moving third party production through the appalachian gathering system and  in related processing fees for liquids extraction through our rogersville plant 
we also had contributions of  from gas utility sales and  from our interest in the gathering system that services a non operated coalbed methane project in the arkoma basin

margins for contract drilling operations reflect our cost plus pricing model  which we adopted in to address price volatility for drilling services  equipment and steel casing requirements 
the increase in production expenses in primarily reflects our volumetric growth and higher severance and production taxes  as well as  in hauling costs for natural gas liquids  which we began stripping from our appalachian production through our rogersville plant during the first quarter of the year 
as a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  our production expenses were  compared to in  primarily reflecting start up costs for bringing our rogersville processing plant and our fonde and haley s mill gathering systems on line  as well as added transportation fees for extracted natural gas liquids 
gas transmission  compression and processing expenses in were of associated revenues  compared to in the prior year 
the margins for this part of our business benefited from third party fees generated by the appalachian gathering system 
our gas transmission  compression and processing expenses do not include capitalized costs of approximately million during for extensions of our field wide gas gathering systems and additions to compression capacity required to bring new wells on line 
sg a expenses in increased by from the prior year  primarily reflecting sales costs for a drilling partnership launched in april for participation in our non operated initiatives in west virginia and virginia  along with overhead costs for supporting our expanded operations as a whole 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased from in to in non cash charges for options  warrants and deferred compensation reflect the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options 
we also recognized an accrual of  in for deferred compensation costs 
the increase in dd a charges in reflects substantial additions to our oil and gas properties  gas gathering systems and related equipment 
we recognized bad debt expenses aggregating  in for write offs of receivables from a regional refinery for sales prior to its bankruptcy filing  a separate non performing loan to a regional operator on a three well project in texas and unreimbursed trade debt we paid on behalf of a virginia steam company in which we previously held a interest 
see critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts 
interest expense for decreased from lower variable rates under our revolving credit facility 
draws under the credit facility were used primarily to support our ongoing drilling initiatives and enhancements of our field wide gas gathering systems 
deferred income tax expense recognized in both reported periods represents future tax liability at the operating company level 
although we have no current tax liability due to the utilization of intangible drilling costs  our consolidated income tax expense is negatively impacted by the non recognition of tax benefits at the parent company level 
net income and eps 
we realized net income of  in  compared to a net loss of  recognized in  reflecting the foregoing factors 
eps was based on  weighted average basic common shares outstanding in  compared to eps of in based on  weighted average common shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
we completed a registered direct placement of million units at per unit on august   with net proceeds of approximately million applied to debt reduction under our revolving credit facility 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and a warrant to buy common share 
the warrants are exercisable for a total of million shares of our common stock at per share  subject to adjustment for certain dilutive issuances  during a four year term expiring in february during  we generated net cash of  from operating activities and  from investing activities  which included our proceeds from the appalachian gathering system sale  all of which were applied to debt reduction under our revolving credit facility 
our investing activities also included capital expenditures aggregating  of which  was recorded as net additions to oil and gas properties 
as a result of these activities  net cash increased to  at december  from  at the prior year end 
operating activities in provided net cash of  during the year  we used  in investing activities  most of which were capital expenditures for additions to our oil and gas properties and gathering systems 
these investments were funded in part with net cash of  from financing activities  primarily consisting of advances under our revolving credit facility 
as a result of these activities  net cash decreased from  at the end of to  at december  our working capital generally reflects wide fluctuations from the timing of customer deposits and expenditures under drilling contracts with our sponsored partnerships and from draws and payments under our credit facility 
since these fluctuations are normalized over relatively short time periods  we do not consider working capital to be a reliable measure of our liquidity 
in addition  based on the december maturity of our convertible notes  their entire carrying amount was reclassified as a current liability at december  this comprised most of the working capital deficit at year end  which was eliminated in january from the restructuring of our convertible debt 
capital resources 
our business involves significant capital requirements 
the rate of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
without successful development activities  our proved reserves would decline as oil and gas is produced from our proved developed reserves 
we also have substantial annual drilling commitments under various leases and farmouts for our appalachian properties  including an annual well commitment for our leatherwood field 
our long term performance and profitability is dependent not only on meeting these commitments and recovering existing oil and gas reserves  but also on our ability to find or acquire additional reserves and fund their development on terms that are economically and operationally advantageous 
historically  we have relied on a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and private placements of our convertible notes and equity securities to fund our reserve and infrastructure development and acquisition activities 
we also relied on participation in our drilling initiatives by outside investors in our sponsored partnerships 
for  we changed our business model to accelerate organic growth by retaining all of our available working interest in wells drilled on operated properties  limiting our use of drilling partnerships to non operated initiatives 
while we are committed to continue expanding our reserves and production through the drillbit  we have addressed the challenging conditions in our industry during the last two years by monetizing the appalachian gathering system  restructuring our convertible debt  reducing our capital expenditures and returning to our successful partnership structure for sharing development costs on operated properties 
we raised million last year for our drilling partnership 
this enabled us to meet our near term commitments and objectives with a reduced drilling budget of million  reflecting a reduction from our capital expenditures allocated to drilling 
we have a interest before payout and a interest after payout in our program  which is participating in horizontal wells 
we plan to retain this strategy for participation by our drilling partnership in up to horizontal wells on our core properties  while continuing to maintain capital expenditures in line with our anticipated cash flow from operations 
with our critical infrastructure in place to provide deliverability with strong market access for our production  this will allow us to continue delivering organic growth  although at lower rates than we could achieve by retaining more of our available working interest in new wells 
if market conditions improve  we would expect to raise additional capital to advance our long term resource development objectives 
in january  we retired million of our convertible notes due december  retired notes in exchange for an aggregate of million in new amortizing convertible notes due may  exchange notes  together with  shares of our common stock  five year warrants to purchase  common shares exchange warrants and cash payments totaling approximately million 
the exchange notes bear interest at per annum  payable in cash at the beginning of each calendar quarter 
they are convertible at the option of the holders into our common stock at per share  and the exchange warrants are exercisable at per share  subject in each case to certain volume limitations and adjustments for certain fundamental change transactions or share recapitalizations 
under certain conditions  we may call the exchange notes for redemption to force their conversion 
during the period from june  through the maturity date  we will be obligated to make equal monthly principal amortization payments on outstanding exchange notes 
subject to certain volume limitations  true up adjustments and other conditions  we may elect to pay all or part of each principal installment in common stock  valued at the lesser of per share or of the day vwap prior to the installment date 
each holder may elect to defer any installment payment to maturity 
holders also have the right to require us to redeem their exchange notes in cash upon any event of default at of their principal amount or upon a change of control at of their principal amount 
any exchange notes that are neither repaid  redeemed nor converted will be repayable at maturity in cash plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we have a senior secured revolving credit facility maintained by our operating subsidiaries with keybank national association  as agent and primary lender 
the facility provides for revolving term loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to million  with a scheduled maturity in september outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest at fluctuating rates ranging from the agent s prime rate to above that rate  depending on the amount of borrowing base utilization 
we are also responsible for commitment fees at rates ranging from to of the unused borrowing base 
the facility is guaranteed by ngas and is secured by liens on our oil and gas properties 
outstanding borrowings under the facility aggregated million at december   with a borrowing base of million and a interest rate 
we are in compliance with our financial and other covenants under the credit agreement covering the facility 
in january  we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement that permitted us to consummate the exchange transaction for our convertible debt  subject to certain non financial covenants and borrowing base modifications 
these include restrictions on upstream dividends from our operating subsidiary for any principal amortization payments on the exchange notes that would cause outstanding borrowings under the facility to exceed of the prevailing borrowing base 
the amendment also provides for monthly reductions of million to the borrowing base from february until the next semi annual redetermination scheduled for april  resulting in a borrowing base of million as of the date of this report 
under the terms of the amendment  the borrowing base will be further reduced by million  representing an upstream dividend we used for repurchasing retired notes in the exchange transaction  unless recontributed for debt reduction under the credit facility by june  our ability to service and repay our revolving and convertible debt will be subject to our future performance and prospects as well as market and general economic conditions 
our future revenues  profitability and rate of growth will continue to be substantially dependent on the market price for natural gas 
future commodity prices will also have a significant impact on our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity  obtain additional capital on acceptable terms and attract drilling partnership capital 
while we have been able to mitigate some of the steep decline in natural gas prices with fixed price  fixed volume physical delivery contracts that cover portions of our natural gas production  we are exposed to price volatility for future production not covered by these arrangements 
see risk factors and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we have addressed the economic downturn and challenging conditions in our industry by monetizing most of our gas gathering infrastructure  deleveraging and modifying our business model to reduce our reliance on the financial and capital markets 
to realize our long term goals for growth in revenues and reserves  however  we will continue to dependent on those sources of capital or other financing alternatives 
any prolonged constriction in the capital markets or protracted weakness in domestic energy markets could require us to sell additional assets or pursue other financing or strategic arrangements to meet those objectives and to repay or refinance our long term debt at maturity 
forward looking statements some statements made by us in this report are prospective and constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the exchange act and section a of the securities act of other than statements of historical fact  all statements that address future activities  outcomes and other matters we plan  expect  budget  intend or estimate  and other similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
among other things  these include uncertainty about estimates of future natural gas production and required capital expenditures  commodity price volatility  increases in the cost of drilling  completion  gas gathering and processing or other costs of developing and producing our reserves  unavailability of drilling rigs and services  drilling  operational and environmental risks  and uncertainties about future federal and state regulatory  conservation and tax measures 
if the assumptions we use in making forward looking statements prove incorrect or the risks described in this report occur  our actual results could differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see risk factors 
financial market risk interest rate risk 
borrowings under our secured credit facility bear interest at fluctuating market based rates 
accordingly  we are exposed to interest rate risk on current and future indebtedness under the facility 
foreign market risk 
we conduct operations solely in the united states 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets  except to the extent that global demand may affect domestic energy markets 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments general 
our contractual obligations include long term debt  operating leases  drilling commitments  transportation commitments  asset retirement obligations and leases for office facilities and various types of equipment 
the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at december  and their future maturities 
the table does not include commitments under our gas gathering and sales agreements described below 
operating leases long term year equipment premises total debt and thereafter total excludes an allocation of  for the unaccreted debt discount on million of convertible notes due december  which were reclassified as current liabilities at december  and restructured in january gas gathering and sales commitments 
we have various commitments under our gas gathering and sales agreements entered with seminole and seminole energy in connection with our sale of the appalachian gathering system during the third quarter of see business and properties recent developments 
these agreements provide us with firm capacity rights for daily delivery of  mcf of controlled gas and have an initial term of fifteen years with extension rights 
our commitments under these agreements include base monthly gathering fees of  with annual escalations at the rate of  base monthly operating fees of  plus per mcf of purchased gas  and monthly capital fees in amounts intended to yield a internal rate of return for all capital expenditures on the appalachian gathering system by seminole energy 
related party transactions because we operate through subsidiaries and managed drilling partnerships  our corporate structure causes various agreements and transactions in the normal course of business to be treated as related party transactions 
our policy to structure any transactions with related parties only on terms that are no less favorable to ngas than could be obtained on an arm s length basis from unrelated parties 
significant related party transactions are summarized in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis  and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable 
the critical accounting policies affecting our financial reporting are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
policies involving the most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below 
estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows 
estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows are used in impairment tests of goodwill and other long lived assets 
these estimates are prepared as of year end by independent petroleum engineers and are updated internally at mid year 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is dependent on the quality of available data and is subject to engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of our drilling  testing and production after the date of these estimates may require future revisions  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property  equipment and goodwill 
long lived assets with an indefinite life are reviewed at least annually for impairment  and all long lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
during  we recognized an impartment charge of  for exploratory well costs that had been capitalized for less than one year pending our assessment of reserves for the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate to reflect losses that could result from failures by customers or other parties to make payments on our trade receivables 
the estimates of this allowance  when maintained  are based on a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the trade accounts receivable  specific information obtained on the financial condition of customers and specific agreements or negotiated settlements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity  provide capital resources or for any other purpose 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our major market risk exposure is the pricing of natural gas production  which has been highly volatile and unpredictable during the last several years 
while we do not use financial hedging instruments to manage these risks  we do use fixed price  fixed volume physical delivery contracts that cover portions of our natural gas production at specified prices during varying periods of time up to two years from the contract date 
because these physical delivery contracts qualify for the normal purchase and sale exception under derivative fair value accounting standards  they are not treated as financial hedging activities and are not subject to mark to market accounting 
the financial impact of physical delivery contracts is included in our oil and gas revenues at the time of settlement  which in turn affects our average realized natural gas prices
