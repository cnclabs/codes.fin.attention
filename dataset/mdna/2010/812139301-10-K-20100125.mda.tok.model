item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this filing 
except where the context suggests otherwise  the terms we  us and our refer to sealy corporation and its subsidiaries 
business overview we believe we are the largest bedding manufacturer in the world  with a wholesale domestic market share of approximately in we believe our market share in is comparable to we manufacture and market a complete line of bedding innerspring and non innerspring products  including mattresses and box springs  holding leading positions in key market categories such as luxury bedding products and among leading retailers 
our conventional bedding products include the sealy  sealy posturepedic  stearns foster and bassett brands and account for approximately of our total domestic net sales for the year ended november  in addition to our innerspring bedding  we also produce a variety of visco elastic memory foam and latex foam bedding products 
we expect to gain market share in these product lines as we seek to strengthen our competitive position in the specialty bedding non innerspring mattress market 
we distinguish ourselves from our major competitors by maintaining our own component parts manufacturing capability and producing substantially all of our mattress innerspring and latex mattress components requirements 
during fiscal  we made the strategic decision to outsource the production of our box spring components to a third party as we expect this to be more cost advantageous for us in the current and future periods 
the current economic and weak retail environments have affected the level of spending by end consumers and have caused a decrease in mattress sales across the industry 
from january through september  the total decrease in sales levels was as reported by the international sleep products association ispa sample of leading manufacturers 
we expect the business environment to remain challenging in we continue to focus on the development of innovative products that are preferred by consumers and our retail customers 
with superior  innovative product  we intend to maintain a disproportionate share of the premium priced products in the market 
in fiscal  we introduced our redesigned stearns foster product line which features our variable response technology foam to provide a softer  more indulgent sleep surface 
additionally  we introduced three new stearns foster models to target the upper end luxury price points and new posturepedic beds with price points above  our industry continues to recover from volatility in the price of petroleum based and steel products  which affects the cost of our polyurethane foam  polyester  polyethylene foam and steel innerspring component parts 
domestic supplies of these raw materials are being limited by supplier consolidation  the exporting of these raw materials outside of the us and other forces beyond our control 
during fiscal  the cost of these components saw significant increases above their recent historical averages 
these costs  particularly those related to steel and polyurethane and latex foams  decreased during the third quarter of fiscal and we have seen some stabilization of these prices during the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to reduced volatility in related commodity prices 
the manufacturers of products such as petro chemicals and wire rod  which are the feed stocks purchased by our suppliers of foam and drawn wire  may reduce supplies in an effort to maintain higher prices 
these actions would delay or eliminate price reductions from our suppliers 
our foreign subsidiaries contributed of our total revenues during fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease from the prior year has been primarily driven by greater percentage decreases in sales volumes for the canada and europe business units during  which has been driven by a combination of weaker retail sales environments and the declines in local currencies relative to the us dollar 
raw materials the cost of our steel innerspring  polyurethane foam  polyester  and polyethlylene component parts were impacted sharply by the volatility in the prices of steel and petroleum in fiscal during fiscal  the prices paid for steel and latex foam decreased from prior year levels and stabilized somewhat due to a reduction in the volatility in the related commodity prices 
we periodically enter into commodity based physical contracts to buy natural gas at agreed upon fixed prices 
these contracts are entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not engage in commodity hedging programs  but continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk associated with price volatility 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
us gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we choose accounting policies within us gaap that our management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
our management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item we believe the following accounting estimates are critical to understanding our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements cooperative advertising  rebate and other promotional programs we enter into agreements with our customers to provide funds to the customer for advertising and promotion of our products 
we also enter into volume and other rebate programs with our customers whereby funds may be rebated to the customer 
when sales are made to these customers  we record liabilities pursuant to these agreements 
we periodically assess these liabilities based on actual sales and claims to determine whether all of the cooperative advertising earned will be used by the customer or whether the customers will meet the requirements to receive rebate funds 
we generally negotiate these agreements on a customer by customer basis 
some of these agreements extend over several periods and are linked with supply agreements 
most of these agreements coincide with our fiscal year  however  our customers typically have ninety days following the end of a period to submit claims for reimbursement of advertising and promotional costs 
therefore  significant estimates are required at any point in time with regard to the ultimate reimbursement to be claimed by our customers 
subsequent revisions to such estimates are recorded and charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified 
changes in underlying spending patterns related to these incentive programs could impact our margins 
costs of these programs totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
of these costs  amounts associated with volume rebates  supply agreement amortization  slotting fees  end consumer rebates and other customer allowances which were recorded as a reduction of sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the costs associated with cooperative advertising were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses and were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts beginning in and continuing through the first quarter of fiscal  the economic environment became more challenging and caused a higher occurrence of bankruptcies for mattress retailers 
however  we have seen a decrease in the frequency of bankruptcies of our customers in the second through fourth quarter of fiscal these economic conditions have also caused some smaller mattress retailers to exit the market 
we continue to actively monitor the financial condition of our customers to determine the potential for any nonpayment of trade receivables 
in determining our reserve for bad debts  we also consider other general economic factors 
our management believes that our process of specific review of customers  combined with overall analytical review provides a reliable evaluation of ultimate collectibility of trade receivables 
we recorded a bad debt provision of million  or approximately percent of sales  in fiscal provisions for bad debts recorded in fiscal and were million approximately of sales and million approximately of sales  respectively 
warranties and product returns our warranty policy provides a year non prorated warranty service period on all currently manufactured sealy posturepedic  stearns foster and bassett bedding products and some other sealy branded products and a year warranty period on the major components of our trueform and mirrorform visco elastic products as well as our springfree latex product  introduced in  the last ten years of which are prorated on a straight line basis 
in  we introduced and subsequently discontinued right touch  which has a twenty year limited warranty that covers only certain parts of the product and is prorated for part of the twenty years 
we amended our warranty policy on sealy brand value priced bedding to three years beginning with our new line introduced in fiscal the impact of the changes to the warranty policies did not have a significant impact on our financial results or position 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage at the time the sale is recorded based on historical trends of warranty costs 
we utilize warranty trends on existing similar product in order to estimate future warranty claims associated with newly introduced product 
changes in the historical trends of these returns could impact the estimates for future periods 
our accrued warranty liability totaled million as of november  and november  in fiscal  we completed an analysis of our returns claims experience for the us business within the americas segment based on historical return trends using new information that is available which allows us to better track and match claims received to the sales for which those claims were initially recorded 
this change in estimate resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of approximately million for fiscal as well as a corresponding reduction in the accrued returns obligation 
our estimate involves an application of the lag time in days between the sale date and the date of its return applied to the current rate of returns 
share based compensation plans we have two share based compensation plans  as described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for new awards issued and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled  the cost is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant  and compensation expense is recognized for those awards earned over the service period 
certain of the equity awards vest based upon the company achieving certain ebitda performance targets 
during the service period  management estimates whether or not the ebitda performance targets will be met in order to determine the vesting period for those awards and what amount of compensation cost should be recognized related to these awards 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing formula  the trinomial lattice model or the closing price of the company s common stock  as appropriate under the circumstances 
management estimates the period of time the employee will hold the option prior to exercise and the expected volatility of sealy corporation s stock  each of which impacts the fair value of the stock options 
the fair value of restricted shares and restricted share units is based upon the closing price of the company s common stock as of the grant date 
we also estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited based on the historical forfeiture rates experienced for our outstanding awards 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for certain losses related to medical claims with excess loss coverage of  per claim per year 
we also utilize large deductible policies to insure claims related to general liability  product liability  automobile  and workers compensation 
our recorded liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated workers compensation liability is discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by us and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation  or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
we assess recoverability using several methodologies  including the present value of estimated future cash flows and comparisons of multiples of enterprise values to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted at rates consistent with the cost of capital specific to the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the indicated fair value of the reporting unit  a second analysis is performed to allocate the fair value to all assets and liabilities 
if  based on the second analysis  it is determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  goodwill is considered impaired 
our fiscal annual evaluation for goodwill impairment indicated a potential impairment of the goodwill for our argentina reporting unit 
as a result  we estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill in this reporting unit compared to carrying amounts and recorded an impairment charge of million to impair the entire balance of goodwill recorded in the argentina reporting unit 
the impairment charge is based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  market conditions deteriorated significantly 
this deterioration resulting from the global economic downturn had not yet matured or been considered in our annual test of goodwill 
because of the potential impact of these conditions on our projections and the indicated fair value of our reporting units  we performed an interim evaluation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of reflecting our current views regarding the impact of the changed economic environment 
this analysis indicated potential impairment in the goodwill of our europe and puerto rico reporting units 
as a result  we estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill in those reporting units compared to carrying amounts and recorded an impairment charge of million to impair goodwill  including million recorded in the puerto rico reporting unit and million in the europe reporting unit 
the impairment charge recorded in fiscal was based upon estimates of the fair value of property and equipment and certain intangible assets  including customer relationships 
during fiscal  we completed our measurement of the impairment loss for the europe reporting unit and concluded that the entire balance of the goodwill of this reporting unit was determined to be impaired 
thus  the million impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal as an estimate required no adjustment in fiscal the total carrying value of our goodwill was million and million at november  and november   respectively 
based on the results of our annual impairment testing  the fair value of the reporting units that maintain goodwill balances at november  significantly exceeded their carrying value 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
a negative outcome of these matters is considered remote  and management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we record an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  is not more likely than not 
these deferred tax items represent expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which may result in tax deductions in the future 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowance and income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements 
our net deferred tax assets at november  were million  net of a million valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our federal  state and foreign tax positions and in the determination of our tax provision 
despite our belief that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate  it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax matters 
we may adjust these liabilities as relevant circumstances evolve  such as guidance from the relevant tax authority  our tax advisors  or resolution of issues in the courts 
these adjustments are recognized as a component of income tax expense entirely in the period in which they are identified 
results of operations during the year end financial close process of fiscal  we discovered an error related to the depreciation of the assets acquired through our purchase of certain of our european subsidiaries in fiscal we also discovered an error related to the deferred income tax liabilities recorded on these assets 
the errors  which were immaterial to the prior periods  resulted in an understatement of depreciation expense and an overstatement of the income tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations for prior periods 
the recorded balances of accumulated depreciation and deferred tax liabilities were likewise understated and overstated  respectively in the consolidated balance sheets for prior periods 
as further discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements in item  we evaluated the effects of these errors in accordance with applicable sec guidance and concluded that no prior period is materially misstated 
nonetheless  we decided to restate our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended november  and december   which restated periods are discussed below 
such restatement had no impact on our compliance with the indentures governing our senior notes  our notes or our convertible notes or our abl revolver agreement

total us net sales of million for fiscal decreased million from  million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the us net sales decrease of million was attributable primarily to a decrease in wholesale unit volume  coupled with a decrease in wholesale average unit selling price 
the decrease in unit volume resulted from weak retail demand throughout the year 
the slight decrease in average unit selling price was due to increased interest in our value priced sealy brand product as a result of its appeal to more price conscious consumers in this economic environment 
however  those decreases were partially offset by increased interest in our newly designed stearns foster product line which was introduced in the second quarter of fiscal  the favorable impact of the july price increase  increased delivery revenue and fewer discounted floor samples in fiscal as the stearns foster product launch was not distributed as widely as the posturepedic product launched in fiscal international net sales decreased million  or from fiscal to million 
excluding the effects of currency fluctuations  net sales declined from fiscal this decline was due to the weak retail environment in all of our major markets 
in canada  local currency sales decreases of translated into decreases of in us dollars due to a lower average value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
local currency sales decreases in our canadian market were driven by a decrease in unit volume and a decrease in average unit selling price 
the decrease in unit volume is primarily attributable to weak canadian retail demand while the decrease in average unit selling price is due to increased sales of value oriented beds 
elsewhere in the americas  we have experienced sales decreases in our mexico and south american markets 
in our europe segment  local currency sales decreases of translated into a decrease of in us dollars due to a decline in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar

us gross profit decreased million to million or of net sales  which is an increase of percentage points of net sales from the prior year period 
the increase in percentage of net sales was driven primarily by the continued favorable impact of operations efficiencies and lower material costs 
partially offsetting these improvements was a decrease in absorption of fixed costs 
the local currency gross profit margin in canada was as a percentage of net sales which represents a decrease of percentage points from fiscal this decrease as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of currency fluctuations on raw materials purchases 
in our europe segment  the local currency gross profit margin increase of percentage points was due to the shift in product sales mix towards more finished goods sales coupled with decreased prices of raw materials due to the deflation in the prices of the underlying commodities 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the slight increase as a percent of sales is primarily due to lower sales volumes

fixed operating costs  exclusive of compensation expense  decreased million from the prior year period primarily due to reductions in national advertising expenses of million and discretionary expenditures such as professional fees and travel and entertainment

in addition  foreign exchange transaction and severance related costs improved million and million  respectively from fiscal goodwill impairment loss 
during fiscal  we recognized a total non cash charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill of our argentina reporting unit

as a result  we incurred certain insignificant costs related to one time terminations of employees 
additionally  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million for the related equipment used in this manufacturing process that was not sold 
this plan was completed in the second quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  management made the decision to cut back the manufacturing operations in brazil and move to a business model under which significantly more product will be supplied by production from other sealy manufacturing facilities

the decrease in unit volume was affected by weak retail demand  which intensified in our fiscal fourth quarter 
sales of our new posturepedic  smartlatex and sealy branded products outperformed the rest of the portfolio 
the slight increase in average unit selling price was due in part to the price increases taken in december and july average unit selling price was also favorably impacted by the million favorable impact from the change in the estimated reserve for non warranty product returns 
partially offsetting these favorable effects was the impact of increased floor sample discounts related to new product introductions as well as softer sales of higher price point products such as stearns foster 
in canada  local currency sales decreases of translated into decreases of in us dollars as retail demand in this market increasingly deteriorated during the year 
local currency sales decreases in our canadian market were driven by a decrease in unit volume  offset by a increase in average unit selling price

the decrease in gross profit for the americas segment was primarily driven by a decrease in the us gross profit in fiscal us gross profit decreased million to million or of net sales  which is a decrease of percentage points of net sales from the prior year period 
the decrease in percentage of net sales was driven primarily by higher inflation on core inputs such as steel and foam

additionally  incremental costs of approximately million were incurred in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to compliance with july federal flame retardant regulations 
the us gross profit was positively impacted by a change in accounting estimate related to our warranty returns reserves recorded in the second quarter of fiscal which resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of approximately million

the effective rate for the fiscal period was increased by due to lower pre tax income and the impairment of goodwill for our puerto rico and europe reporting units which is not tax deductible 
the effective rate for the fiscal period was reduced by a benefit of approximately million resulting from a reduction in our income tax reserve as a result of the elimination of certain federal and state tax exposures due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and approximately million from the reduction of the valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards due to the availability of capital gains  and the reversal of previously established valuation allowances for mexican deferred tax assets  partially offset by valuation allowances established during the year 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources of funds our principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our asset based revolving credit facility which provides commitments of up to million maturing in may the abl revolver 
our principal use of funds consists of operating expenditures  payments of interest on our senior debt  capital expenditures  and interest payments on our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
capital expenditures totaled million for fiscal during fiscal  there was no significant spending for additional production capacity 
we believe that annual capital expenditure limitations in our current debt agreements will not prevent us from meeting our ongoing capital needs 
our introductions of new products typically require us to make initial cash investments in inventory  promotional supplies and employee training which may not be immediately recovered through new product sales 
however  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb such expenditures related to new products and that these expenses will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating cash flow 
at november   we had approximately million available for borrowing under the abl revolver which represents the calculated borrowing base reduced by outstanding letters of credit of million 
we currently believe that our liquidity is adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements 
the calculated borrowing base under the abl revolver is determined based on our domestic accounts receivable and inventory balances 
our net weighted average borrowing cost was and for fiscal and  respectively 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under the abl revolver 
on may   we announced a comprehensive plan to refinance our existing senior secured credit facilities the old senior credit facility and replace them with indebtedness that has longer dated maturities and eliminates quarterly financial ratio based maintenance covenants 
the refinancing converted much of the existing senior debt from debt bearing interest at variable rates to debt bearing interest at fixed rates 
due to increases in the interest rates associated with our senior debt  the amount of debt outstanding and increases in the amortization of debt issuance costs  our interest expense in future periods is expected to increase significantly 
however  we do not expect cash interest payments to change significantly due to the payment in kind interest associated with the convertible notes as discussed below 
based on our current cash position and the availability of funds through our abl revolver  we believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds as necessary during fiscal in order to support our operations 
debt in connection with the refinancing  we have entered into a new asset based revolving credit facility which provides commitments of up to million maturing in may  which bears interest at our choice of either a base rate determined by reference to the higher of several rates as defined by the abl revolver agreement or a libor rate for us dollar deposits plus an applicable margin of  issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due april the senior notes  which bear interest at per annum payable semi annually  and issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible paid in kind pik notes due july which are convertible into shares of the company s common stock the convertible notes and bear interest at per annum payable semi annually in the form of additional convertible notes 
at november   there were no amounts outstanding under the abl revolver 
the senior notes have an outstanding balance of million at november  which gives effect to an unamortized original issue discount of million 
as of november   the convertible notes have an outstanding principal balance of million 
we also have an outstanding principal balance of million at november  on the senior subordinated notes due the notes 
future interest payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations and borrowings on our abl revolver 
the abl revolver provides for revolving credit financing  subject to borrowing base availability 
the borrowing base consists of the following of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable and the lesser of i of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory or ii of the net amount of eligible inventory 
these amounts are reduced by reserves deemed necessary by the lenders 
at november   there were no amounts outstanding under the abl revolver 
prior to the refinancing  we had outstanding three interest rate swap agreements related to term debt under our old senior credit facility 
in connection with the refinancing  we paid million to terminate these interest rate swap agreements 
as the future variable interest rate payments are no longer likely to be made  the amounts which had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income were charged to refinancing expense for the year ended november  we are also party to three interest rate swaps for million euros  million euros and million euros which fix the floating interest rates on the debt of our europe segment at  and  respectively 
the notional amounts of these contracts amortize over the life of the agreement and the agreements expire in may  january and october we have not formally documented these interest rate swaps as hedges 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of interest expense 
the outstanding senior subordinated notes due the notes consist of an original million aggregate principal amount maturing june   bearing interest at per annum payable semiannually in arrears on june and december  commencing on december  at november   the outstanding balance of the notes was million 
at november   we were in compliance with the covenants contained within our abl revolver agreement and the indentures governing the senior notes  the convertible notes and the notes 
these agreements also restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase common stock 
as part of our ongoing evaluation of our capital structure  we continually assess opportunities to reduce our debt  which opportunities may from time to time include the redemption or repurchase of a portion of our senior notes  the notes or the convertible notes to the extent permitted by our debt covenants 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company repurchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of the notes on the open market at of par  plus accrued interest 
in addition  our board authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock 
as of november   we have repurchased shares for million under this program  none of which was repurchased during fiscal from november  through january   we did not repurchase any additional shares under this program 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay the interest or liquidated damages  if any  on or to refinance our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we will be required to make scheduled principal payments of million during the next twelve months  with million for our financing obligations and capital leases and the remainder for debt owed by our international subsidiaries 
however  as we continually evaluate our ability to make additional prepayments as permitted under our abl revolver agreement and the indentures governing the senior notes  the convertible notes and the notes  it is possible that we will redeem or repurchase portions of our senior or subordinated debt during that time 
dividend the indentures governing the senior notes  the notes and the convertible notes contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends which we do not currently meet and until we do so  we will not be able to declare a dividend 
additionally  our abl revolver agreement includes a requirement that we meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio for the payment of dividends 
although we meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement as of november  because we do not meet the other restrictions  we will not be able to declare a dividend 
cash flow analysis the following table summarizes our changes in cash fiscal year in thousands statement of cash flow data cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning of period end of period we use a week fiscal year ending on the closest sunday to november  but no later than december the fiscal years ended november  and november  were week years 
the fiscal year ended december  was a week year 
year ended november  compared with year ended november  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations increased million to a million net source of cash for the year ended november   compared to a million net source of cash for the year ended november  this increase has been driven by an increase in net income from fiscal of million coupled with net cash provided by changes in working capital in fiscal of million compared with a net use of cash for working capital in fiscal of million 
this increase has been driven  in part by the receipt of million of income tax refunds and improved working capital management during fiscal cash flows used in investing activities 
our cash flows used in investing activities decreased approximately million from fiscal primarily due to million of proceeds from the sale leaseback of our south gate  california facility coupled with million lower capital expenditures as compared with fiscal cash flows used in financing activities 
our cash flow provided by financing activities for the year ended november  was million compared with cash used in financing activities in fiscal of million 
this change has been primarily driven by the refinancing which provided approximately million of cash after considering the effects of the payments of costs to issue our new debt 
year ended november  compared with year ended december  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations decreased million to a million net source of cash for the year ended november   compared to a million net source of cash for the year ended december  this decrease has been primarily driven by a reduction in net income from fiscal of million 
this decrease has been partially offset by changes in working capital driven primarily by a reduction in accounts receivable balances 
cash flows used in investing activities 
our cash flows used in investing activities decreased approximately million from fiscal primarily due to million lower capital expenditures for fiscal as compared with the prior fiscal year 
the decreased capital expenditures were primarily due to the completion of our new facility in orlando  florida  the completion of the mountain top  pennsylvania facility and the commencement of work on a second production line at the same facility and the construction of a warehouse at our production site in italy in fiscal these expenditures were partially offset by million in lower proceeds on sales of assets 
fiscal results included million received from the sale of our orlando  florida facility 
cash flows used in financing activities 
our cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended november  decreased million to a net use of million from a net use of million for the year ended december  this decrease has been driven by million less of dividend payments and million less net borrowings against our senior revolving credit facility in fiscal further  in fiscal  million was used to repurchase our common stock  million was used to retire a portion of our notes and million was used for payments on our senior secured term loans 
debt covenants our long term obligations contain various financial tests and covenants  but do not require that we meet quarterly financial ratio targets in order to maintain compliance 
our abl revolver requires us to meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in order to incur additional indebtedness and make dividend distributions to holders of our common stock  subject to certain exceptions 
additionally  the abl revolver requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of to in periods of minimum availability where the availability for two consecutive calendar days is less than the greater of of the total commitment under the abl revolver and million 
as of november   we are in compliance with the covenants and are not in a minimum availability period under the abl revolver 
the indentures governing our senior notes  convertible notes and senior subordinated notes also require us to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio in order to incur additional indebtedness  subject to certain exceptions 
we are in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio at november  the covenants contained in our senior debt agreements restricting our ability to enter into certain transactions are based on what we refer to herein as adjusted ebitda 
in the senior debt agreements  ebitda is defined as net income plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance as discussed above 
adjusted ebitda is presented herein as it is a material component of these covenants 
for instance  the indenture governing the senior notes  convertible notes and notes and the abl revolver agreement each contain financial covenant ratios  specifically leverage and interest coverage ratios  that are calculated by reference to adjusted ebitda 
non compliance with the covenants contained in the abl revolver agreement could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under this facility  while non compliance with the debt incurrence ratios contained in the indenture governing the senior notes  convertible notes and notes would prohibit sealy mattress company and its subsidiaries from being able to incur additional indebtedness other than pursuant to specified exceptions 
in addition  under the restricted payment covenants contained in the indenture governing the senior notes  convertible notes and notes  the ability of sealy mattress company to pay dividends is restricted by formula based on the amount of adjusted ebitda 
while the determination of unusual items is subject to interpretation and requires judgment  we believe the adjustments listed below are in accordance with the covenants 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  they are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
because not all companies use identical calculations  these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and ebitda to adjusted ebitda for the year ended november   november  and december  in thousands net income loss interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda adjustments for debt covenants refinancing charges non cash compensation kkr consulting fees severance charges goodwill impairment restructuring and impairment related charges loss on written option derivative north american realignment other various a adjusted ebitda a consists of various immaterial adjustments 
as of and during the fiscal years ended november   november  and december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained within our debt instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements we occupy premises and utilize equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the obligations under those leases are not recorded on our balance sheet 
many of these leases provide for payment of certain expenses and contain renewal and purchase options 
during the fiscal years ended november   november  and december   we recognized lease expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
we are involved in a joint venture to develop markets for sealy branded products in asia 
the joint venture is not considered to be a variable interest entity and is therefore not consolidated for financial statement purposes 
we account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method  and our net investment of million is recorded as a component of other assets including debt issuance costs  net within the consolidated balance sheet at november  we believe that any possible commitments arising from this joint venture will not be significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as previously discussed  our debt at november  consists of an asset based revolving credit facility  under which no amounts are outstanding  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of convertible paid in kind notes due  million outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  million due on our financing obligations and an additional million of other borrowings  most of which are owed by our international subsidiaries 
we engage in various hedging activities in order to mitigate the risk of variability in future cash flows resulting from floating interest rates on our debt and projected foreign currency purchase requirements 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual arrangements for interest rate swaps and forward purchases of foreign currency 
the related assets and liabilities associated with the fair value of such derivative instruments are recorded on our balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in our income statement  except for those associated with those agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our federal  state and foreign tax positions and in the determination of its tax provision 
despite our belief that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate  it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter 
we may adjust these liabilities as relevant circumstances evolve  such as guidance from the relevant tax authority  or resolution of issues in the courts 
these adjustments are recognized as a component of income tax expense entirely in the period in which they are identified 
while we are currently undergoing examinations of certain of its corporate income tax returns by tax authorities  no issues related to these liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been presented to us and we have not been informed that such audits will result in an assessment or payment of taxes related to these positions during the one year period following november  in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
at november   the entire net reserve for uncertain tax positions is million and million as a reduction of non current deferred tax asset including penalties and interest 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
as such  the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities are not included in the table below 
our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of november  are summarized below in thousands contractual obligations after total obligations principal maturities of long term debt projected interest on long term debt projected cash flows on derivatives operating leases obligations under license agreements total other commercial commitments after total commitments standby letters of credit million of our outstanding debt at november  is subject to variable interest rates 
interest payments are projected based on rates in effect at november  assuming no variable rate fluctuations going forward 
an increase in the interest rates applicable to the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt by would result in approximately million in additional annual cash interest expense 
further  these amounts include the paid in kind interest obligation related to our convertible notes which does not represent a cash interest payment 
our hedging instruments consist of the projected net settlements of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts as of november  based on the expected timing of the net payments to be received under the agreements and have not been included in the above presentation as they do not currently represent obligations of the company 
the fair value of these instruments can fluctuate based on market conditions 
obligations under operating leases include only projected payments under current lease terms  excluding renewal options and assuming no exercise of any purchase options 
amounts represent minimum guarantees owed under license agreements 
we issue letters of credit in the ordinary course of business primarily to back our various obligations under workers compensation and other insurance programs  environmental liabilities  and open positions on certain of our derivative instruments 
these obligations will renew automatically on an annual basis unless cancelled per our instructions 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  we have a million long term obligation arising from underfunded pension plans 
future minimum pension funding requirements are not included in the schedule above as they are not available for all periods presented 
during fiscal  we estimate that we will make approximately million in contributions to the plans 
in fiscal  we contributed million into the plans 
there are no agreements to purchase goods or services with fixed or minimum obligations 
the schedule above does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business 
foreign operations and export sales we operate three manufacturing and distribution center facilities in canada  and one each in mexico  argentina  uruguay and brazil 
in  we formed a joint venture with our australian licensee to import  manufacture  distribute and sell sealy branded products in south east asia 
on december   a fifty percent interest in our operations in south korea was sold for million to our australian licensee and these operations became part of the joint venture 
on december   the company and its australian licensee each acquired a interest in a joint venture that owns the assets of our former new zealand licensee 
the purchase price for the ownership was million 
additional contributions of million were made by each party to the joint venture to fund the initial working capital of this entity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
we also export products directly into many small international markets  and have license agreements in thailand  japan  the united kingdom  spain  australia  south africa  israel  jamaica  saudi arabia  the bahamas and the dominican republic 
the results of these export operations are considered a component of our americas segment

general business risk our customers include furniture stores  specialty sleep shops  department stores  membership warehouse clubs  hospitality customers and other stores 
in the future  these customers may consolidate  undergo restructurings or reorganizations  or realign their affiliations  any of which could decrease the number of locations that carry our products 
these customers are also subject to changes in consumer spending and the overall state of the economy  both domestically and internationally 
as we have seen in fiscal and  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be affected by various economic factors 
unfavorable economic conditions such as the global economic downturn we have experienced have made it more difficult for us to maintain and continue our revenue growth 
in an economic recession or under other adverse economic conditions  customers and vendors may be more likely to be unable to meet contractual terms or their payment obligations 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
fiscal year we use a week fiscal year ending on the closest sunday to november  but no later than december the fiscal years ended november  and november  were week years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of our subsidiaries functional currency as compared to the currencies of our foreign denominated purchases 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to hedge against the earnings and cash flow effects of such fluctuations 
the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which we manufacture or sell our products would have an approximate million dollar impact on our financial position for the year ended november  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from purchases in a foreign currency  we have instituted a forecasted cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our purchases denominated in foreign currencies and royalty payments to third parties with forward contracts 
at november   we had one forward foreign currency contract outstanding to purchase a total of million euros with an expiration date of december  additionally  at november   we had outstanding forward and option foreign currency contracts to sell canadian dollars for a total of million us dollars 
the expiration dates for the canadian dollar contracts range from december  to november  at november   the fair value of these contracts was an asset of million 
the changes in fair value of the foreign currency hedges are included in net income  except for those contracts that have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
for contracts designated as hedges for accounting purposes  the changes in fair value related to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk prior to the refinancing  we had outstanding three interest rate swap agreements related to term debt under our old senior credit facility 
in connection with the refinancing  we paid million to terminate these interest rate swap agreements 
as the future variable interest rate payments are no longer probable of being made  the amounts which had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income were charged to refinancing expense for fiscal  in accordance with the fasb s authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative instruments 
no assets or liabilities were recognized related to the above swap instruments at november  due to their termination prior to this date 
the fair value of the above swap instruments was a liability of million at november  additionally  we have entered into three interest rate swaps for million euro  million euro and million euro which fix the floating interest rates on the debt of our europe segment at  and  respectively 
the notional amounts of these contracts amortize over the life of the agreement and the agreements expire in may  january and october the fair value of these swaps was an asset totaling million and million as of november  and november   respectively 
a increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our interest rate derivative instruments would not have a material impact on our earnings during the next fiscal year 
based on the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt outstanding at november   a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would have an insignificant impact on our annual interest expense 
commodity price risks the cost of our steel innerspring  polyurethane foam  polyester  and polyethlylene component parts were impacted sharply by the volatility in the prices of steel and petroleum in fiscal during fiscal  the prices paid for steel and latex foam decreased from prior year levels and stabilized somewhat due to a reduction in the volatility in the related commodity prices 
we periodically enter into commodity based physical contracts to buy natural gas at agreed upon fixed prices 
these contracts are entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not engage in commodity hedging programs  but continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk associated with price volatility
