item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between prices received for its oil and gas production and the costs to find and produce such oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been  and are expected in the future to be  volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors beyond the control of the company 
the company operates the etame  avouma  south tchibala and ebouri fields on behalf of a consortium of five companies offshore of the republic of gabon 
production commenced from the etame field in and was subsequently expanded through additional development wells in and in  the company developed the avouma and south tchibala fields by setting a platform and tying the field back to the fpso via a pipeline 
oil production commenced from the avouma and south tchibala fields in january oil production began in january from the ebouri field utilizing a platform that was installed in august and connected to the fpso by pipeline 
impact of the current financial and credit markets the us and other international economies experienced a recession  the effects of which could last well into and beyond 
additionally  the financial and credit markets have experienced unprecedented disruptions 
many financial institutions have liquidity concerns prompting intervention from governments 
the company s exposure to the disruptions in the financial markets includes the ability to access the capital markets and investments exposure 
the company does not currently have a credit facility 
if in the future the company determines that it needs a credit facility and the disruption in the financial markets continues or recurs  replacement of the credit facility may be more expensive 
current market conditions also elevate concerns with the company s cash investments including funds in escrow  which at december  totaled million 
the company has reviewed the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which the company maintains investments as well as the securities underlying these investments 
with regard to the company s cash investments  the company invests in bankers acceptances and money market instruments primarily with jpmorgan chase co  which the company believes to be creditworthy 
beginning january  the company s production in gabon is purchased by vitol  which the company believes to be a creditworthy purchaser 
oil and gas prices are also volatile as evidenced by the significant changes during and if experienced  lower commodity prices will reduce the company s cash flows from operations 
critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used by the company in reporting its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting  such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  the company s reported results of operations would be different should it employ an alternative accounting method 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities the sec prescribes in regulation s x the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
like many other oil and gas companies  the company has chosen to follow the successful 
table of contents 
index to financial statements efforts method 
management believes that this method is preferable  as the company has focused on exploration activities wherein there is risk associated with future success and as such earnings are best represented by attachment to the drilling operations of the company 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the life of the related reserves 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses applicable to undeveloped leasehold  leasehold expiration costs and delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with accounting under successful efforts method of accounting  the company reviews proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its oil and gas properties may not be recoverable 
when it is determined that an oil and gas property s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount  an impairment charge must be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
this may occur if a field contains lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
impairment of unproved property the company evaluates its unproved properties for impairment on a property by property basis 
the majority of the company s unproved property consists of acquisition costs related to its undeveloped acreage in angola 
on at least a quarterly basis  management reviews the unproved property for indicators of impairment based on the company s current exploration plans with consideration given to results of any drilling and seismic activity during the period and known information regarding exploration activity by other companies on adjacent blocks 
see item properties and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s exploration plans in angola 
any adverse developments related to the company s ability to extend the drilling obligation date could result in an impairment of the company s unproved properties and other assets of approximately million as well as the loss of the funds the company has escrowed to secure its drilling obligations of million

partially offsetting these additions was a realignment agreement with a joint venture partner that originally did not participate in an appraisal well and one of the development wells in the ebouri field

the company invests cash  not required for immediate operational and capital expenditure needs  in short term bankers acceptance and money market instruments primarily with jpmorgan chase co 
the company does not invest in asset backed commercial paper market which has been subject to a liquidity crisis over the last year

in june  the company executed a loan agreement for a million revolving credit facility secured by the assets of the company s gabon subsidiary 
the facility was available to finance the ebouri field development activities and other etame marin block activities 
the facility extended until october at which point it could be extended by mutual agreement  and the loan drawdown amount could be converted to a term loan at the company s option 
because of the company s limited use of the facility  the ifc elected to not extend the credit facility 
the company elected to not convert the loan balance to a term loan and instead repaid the loan balance of million plus interest in mid october

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s major market risk exposure continues to be the prices applicable to its oil and gas production 
sales prices are primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
foreign exchange risk our results of operations and financial condition are affected by currency exchange rates 
while oil sales are denominated in us dollars  portions of our operating costs in gabon are denominated in the local currency 
a weakening us dollar will have the effect of increasing operating costs while a strengthening us dollar will have the effect of reducing operating costs 
the gabon local currency is tied to the euro 
the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar has fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions  general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
interest rate risk at december  the company did not have any debt and thus no exposure to interest rate risk 
commodity price risk the company had no derivatives in place as of the date of this report  or in  or
