overview income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and securities  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
other significant sources of pre tax income are service charges fees and commissions  which include service charges on deposit accounts  brokerage fee income and other loan fees including loan brokerage fees and late charges  income from bank owned life insurance and income from loan sales and servicing 
in addition  we recognize income or losses from the sale of securities available for sale in years that we have such sales 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance to cover the inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  information about specific borrower situations  estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
expenses 
the non interest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses  occupancy expenses  furniture and equipment expenses  data processing expenses and various other miscellaneous expenses 

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance on a monthly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment evaluation 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  our banking regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period  which would negatively affect earnings 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized into non interest income in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for mortgage servicing rights relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of mortgage servicing rights requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment 
table of contents speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as a component of non interest expense 
other than temporary impairment 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain benefits  and noncurrent marketable equity securities  require companies to perform periodic reviews of individual securities in their investment portfolios to determine whether decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
a review of other than temporary impairment requires companies to make certain judgments regarding the materiality of the decline  its effect on the financial statements and the probability  extent and timing of a valuation recovery and the company s intent and ability to hold the security 
pursuant to these requirements  we assess valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to fundamental factors specific to the issuer  such as financial condition  business prospects or other factors or market related factors  such as interest rates or equity market declines 
declines in the fair value of securities below their costs that are deemed to be other than temporary are recorded in earnings as realized losses 
for declines in the fair value of individual debt securities available for sale below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary  where the company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the other than temporary decline in the fair value of the debt security related to credit loss is recognized in earnings and other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income or loss 
credit loss is determined to exist if the present value of expected future cash flows using the effective rate at acquisition is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security 
for individual debt securities where the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost  the other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the security s cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method 
operating strategy our mission is to operate and grow a profitable community oriented financial institution serving primarily retail customers and businesses in our market areas 
we plan to continue our strategy of expanding our branch network and market area and upgrading our existing branches  continuing to increase our commercial and construction relationships in our expanding market area  increasing our deposit market share in our expanding market area  continuing to increase our sale of non deposit investment products  improving operating efficiency and cost control  and applying disciplined underwriting practices to maintain the high quality of our loan portfolio 
expanding our branch network and market area and upgrading our existing branches as earnings permit 
from our formation in until  we operated solely out of our offices located in chicopee  massachusetts and focused our lending in chicopee and the surrounding area 
recently  our management began to implement a growth strategy that expanded our presence into additional communities contiguous to chicopee 
in  we opened a branch to the east of chicopee in ludlow  and in we opened a branch to the west of chicopee in west springfield 
as a result of our efforts to expand our presence  at december   most of our loan portfolio was secured by property within chicopee and its contiguous communities 
we intend to continue our geographic expansion outside of chicopee by opening branches in communities contiguous to those currently served by chicopee savings bank if market conditions are favorable 
in december  we opened a full service branch in south hadley  massachusetts  and in february  we opened a full service branch in ware  massachusetts 

table of contents continuing to increase our commercial relationships in our expanding market area 
since we have worked to increase our commercial relationships by diversifying our loan portfolio beyond residential mortgage loans and offering business deposit and checking products 
in particular  since december   our commercial real estate and commercial business portfolio has increased million  or  and at december  was of our total loan portfolio 
during this period  we have taken advantage of the significant growth in both residential and commercial real estate development in our market area 
in addition  since december   our securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which are sweep accounts primarily for commercial customers  increased million  or  and at december  and were of total assets 
business deposit and checking accounts increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of 
finally  since  we have also increased the number of our commercial lenders and commercial lending support staff 
increasing our deposit market share in our expanding market area 
retail deposits are our primary source of funds for investing and lending 
by offering a variety of deposit products  special and tiered pricing  and superior customer service  we will seek to retain and expand existing customer relationships as well as attract new deposit customers 
personalized service and flexibility with regard to customer needs will continue to be augmented with a full array of delivery channels to maximize customer convenience 
these include drive up banking  atms  internet banking  automated bill payment  remote capture  and telephone banking 
through our continued focus on these deposit gathering efforts in existing branch locations  couple with our plans for geographic expansion  we expect to increase the overall level of deposits and our market share in the markets we serve 
in addition  historically  one of our primary competitors for retail deposits in the chicopee market area has been credit unions 
credit unions are formidable competitors since  as tax exempt organizations  they are able to offer higher rates on retail deposits than banks 
by expanding our market area beyond the immediate chicopee market area  and beyond the market areas of our larger credit union competitors  we intend to increase our overall deposit market share of hampden county 
continuing to increase our sale of non deposit investment products 
our profits rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
in order to decrease our reliance on interest rate spread income we have pursued initiatives to increase non interest income 
we offer non deposit investment products  including mutual funds  annuities  pension plans  life insurance  long term care and college savings plans through a third party registered broker dealer  linsco private ledger 
this initiative generated   and  of non interest income during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in connection with our expanding branch network  we intend to continue to increase our sale of non deposit investment products by engaging one additional retail investment employee to serve customers of our anticipated branch expansion 
improving operating efficiency 
our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets increased to in from the increase in expenses in was largely impacted by an other than temporary impairment charge of million and increase in fdic insurance premium fees of  which includes the fdic special assessment of  paid in the second quarter of we recognize that our growth strategies have required greater investments in personnel  marketing  premises and equipment  and these investments have had a negative impact on our expense ratios over the short term 
in addition  we have had an increase in operating expenses as a result of our public company status  including costs associated with the internal control requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which have required us to perform a more in depth review of our internal control procedures 
increased operating expenses due to our equity incentive plan  initiated in  have also had a significant impact on our expense ratios 
we also have had higher costs for auditing  accounting  legal and other miscellaneous holding company expenses as a result of being a public company 
we will continue our efforts to monitor costs throughout the organization  and over the long term  as our assets grow  we will attempt to lower our ratio of non interest expense to total average assets 
applying disciplined underwriting practices to maintain the high quality of our loan portfolio 
we believe that high asset quality is a key to long term financial success 
we have sought to grow and diversify the loan portfolio  while maintaining a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk  using underwriting standards that we believe are conservative and diligent monitoring and collection efforts 
at december   our nonperforming loans loans which are or more days delinquent were of our total loan portfolio 
although we intend to continue our efforts to originate commercial real estate  commercial business and construction loans  we intend to continue our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through our conservative approach to lending 

table of contents balance sheet analysis comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the growth in assets was primarily attributable to an increase in net loans of million and held to maturity securities of million 
net loans increased to million at december   from million at december   primarily reflecting origination volume totaling million in the company s level of loan originations was largely due to the decreasing interest rate environment 
these factors were somewhat offset by normal amortization totaling approximately million and the sale of million of loans to fhlmc in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk 
loan payoffs and construction advances and line of credit pay downs also offset loan originations 
the company will continue to evaluate the sale of fixed rate low coupon real estate loans in asset growth was funded primarily through increased deposit balances of million 
total deposits grew to million at december  compared to million at december   reflecting increases in money market accounts of million  or  and demand and now accounts of million  or 
the growth in deposits was mainly attributable to the increase in commercial relationships

the company s book value per share increased to at december  compared to at december  loans 
our primary lending activity is the origination of loans secured by real estate 
we originate one to four family residential loans  commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans 
to a lesser extent  we originate multi family  construction and consumer loans 
the size of our one to four family residential loan portfolio has decreased during  from million to million  primarily due to prepayments and refinancing activity attributed to the decline in interest rates to historically low levels 
in accordance with the company s asset liability management strategy and in an effort to reduce interest rate risk  the company sold million fixed rate  low coupon residential real estate loans originated in to the secondary market 
servicing rights will continue to be retained on all loans written and sold in the secondary market 
our commercial real estate and multi family portfolio increased during  from million to million as a result of new commercial loan relationships established in commercial business loans increased during  from million to million as a result of new commercial relationships  due to increased marketing efforts and offering a wider variety of services for commercial borrowers  including cash management products 
our construction loan portfolio decreased during  from million to million 
commercial construction decreased by million from million to million as projects were completed and sold  offset by an increase in residential construction 
growth in the consumer and home equity loan portfolio of million  from million to million is primarily attributable to increased marketing activities and competitive pricing on our home equity products

the company s equity securities portfolio was primarily designed to assist the company in managing its liquidity and interest rate risk on a long term basis

explanation of use of non gaap financial measurements 
we believe that it is common practice in the banking industry to present interest income and related yield information on tax exempt securities on a tax equivalent basis and that such information is useful to investors because it facilitates comparisons among financial institutions

risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities  that are accounted 
table of contents for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  and technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
management performs a monthly review of all delinquent loans 
the actions taken with respect to delinquency vary depending upon the nature of the delinquent loans and the period of delinquency 
a late charge is normally assessed on loans where the scheduled payment remains unpaid after a day grace period 
after mailing delinquency notices  the company s collection department calls the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency and the repayment status 
through continued heightened account monitoring  collection  and workout efforts  the company attempts to work out a payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure 
if these actions do not result in a satisfactory resolution  the company refers the loan to legal counsel and counsel initiates foreclosure proceedings 
the company is committed to assist the homeowners to remain in their homes 
management reports to the executive committee monthly regarding the amount of loans delinquent 
all loans that are delinquent greater than days  loans that are in foreclosure  and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own are reported in greater detail to the executive committee monthly 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider repossessed assets  loans that are days or more past due  and other loans which have been identified by the company as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal to be nonperforming assets 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they become days delinquent  at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a non accrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned oreo until it is sold 
when property is acquired and placed into oreo  it is recorded at the lower of its cost  or market price  less estimated selling expenses 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
as of december   the company had  classified as oreo 
the following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated

nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and real estate owned 
nonperforming loans consist of all loans days or more past due and other loans which have been identified by the company as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal 

table of contents there were residential real estate loans  with total principal balances of million and total collateral values of million  and five commercial real estate loans  with total principal balances of  and total collateral values of million that were not accruing interest as of december  there was one residential construction loan with a principal balance of  not accruing interest as of december   with a collateral value of  there were no commercial construction loans that were not accruing interest as of december  there were commercial loans not accruing interest as of december   with a combined collateral value of million

the remaining four commercial loans are adequately collateralized 
there were consumer and home equity loans not accruing interest as of december  home equity loans not accruing interest as of december  with total principal balances of  are comprised of six individual loans with a combined collateral value of  collateral values were sufficient to cover the loan balances of non accrual loans

interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended december  had nonperforming loans been current according to their original terms amounted to  interest income recognized on impaired loans for the year ended december  was  regulators have adopted various regulations and practices regarding problem assets of financial institutions 
under such regulations  federal and state examiners have authority to identify problem assets during examinations and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
we perform an internal analysis of our loan portfolio and assets to classify such loans and assets similar to the manner in which such loans and assets are classified by the federal banking regulators 
in addition  we regularly analyze the probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and our nonperforming loans to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
there are four classifications for problem assets special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated special mention 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
non accruing loans are normally classified as substandard 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is normally fully charged off 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified loans at the dates indicated 
december  dollars in thousands special mention loans substandard loans doubtful loans loss loans total classified loans 
table of contents at december   special mention loans consist of million in commercial real estate loans  million in commercial construction loans  and million in commercial business loans  substandard loans consist of million in commercial business loans and million in commercial construction loans  and million in commercial real estate loans  doubtful loans consist of  in commercial business loans and  in commercial real estate loans  and loss loans consist of  in commercial business loans 
the increase in classified loans was due to general deterioration of economic conditions that have led to the inability of some businesses to properly service their debt 
at december   of our classified loans were current with payments 
other than disclosed in the above tables  there are no other loans at december  that management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a monthly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allowance on identified problem loans  and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
specific allowance required for identified problem loans 
we establish an allowance on certain identified problem loans based on such factors as the strength of the customer s personal or business cash flows  the availability of other sources of repayment  the amount due or past due  the type and value of collateral  the strength of our collateral position  the estimated cost to sell the collateral  and the borrower s effort to cure the delinquency 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
we establish a general allowance for loans that are not delinquent to recognize the probable losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning percentages to each category 
the percentages are adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors include levels and historical trends in delinquencies  impaired loans  non accrual loans  charge offs  recoveries  and classified assets  trends in the volume and terms of loans  effects of any change in underwriting  policies  procedures  and practices  experience  ability  and depth of management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  trends and conditions in the industries in which borrowers operate  effects of changes in credit concentrations 
the applied loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
we identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans  classified loans and other loans that management may have concerns about collectability 
for individually reviewed loans  the borrower s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan or a shortfall in collateral value would result in our allocating a portion of the allowance to the loan that was impaired 
at december   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased slightly from million at december  to million at december   due to a provision for loan losses of  partially offset by net charge offs of  the provision for loan losses in the year ended december  reflects management s assessment of several factors 
in particular  non accrual loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  also  net charge offs increased  from december  in addition  management assessed the continued growth of the loan portfolio  particularly the increases in commercial real estate loans  construction loans and commercial business loans  as well as the weakening of the local and national economy

table of contents furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that our banking regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
our banking regulators may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
analysis of loan loss experience

nonperforming loans consist of all loans days or more past due and other loans which have been identified by the company as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal 
interest rate risk management 
we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes adjusting the maturities of borrowings  
table of contents adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration  increasing our focus on shorter term  adjustable rate commercial and multi family lending  selling fixed rate mortgage loans  and periodically selling available for sale securities 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have an asset liability committee  which includes members of management and one member of the board of directors  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee reports to the board of directors of the bank quarterly and establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
net interest income simulation analysis 
we analyze our interest rate sensitivity to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of interest income simulation 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest sensitive 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
interest income simulations are completed monthly and presented to the asset liability committee and board of directors of the bank 
the simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under a range of assumptions 
the numerous assumptions used in the simulation process are reviewed by the asset liability committee and the board of directors of the bank on a quarterly basis 
changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulation 
the simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates 
the simulation analysis incorporates management s current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors 
simulation analysis is only an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
we continually review the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
the table below sets forth an approximation of our exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next month period using interest income simulation 
the simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income simulation 
because of the large percentage of loans we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity 
the following table reflects changes in estimated net interest income for the bank at december  through december  increase decrease in market interest rates rate shock net interest income amount change change dollars in thousands bp  the basis points changes in rates in the above table are assumed to occur evenly over the following months 

table of contents liquidity management 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of securities  borrowings from the fhlb boston and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual loan repayment activity 
our short term investments primarily consist of us treasury and government agencies  which we use primarily for the collateral purposes for sweep accounts maintained by commercial customers 
the balance of these investments fluctuate as the aggregate balance of our sweep accounts fluctuate 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demands  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  net of reserve requirements 
securities classified as available for sale whose market value exceeds our cost  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled  at december  total securities classified as available for sale were  at december  other liquid assets as of december  include us treasury and government agency securities  net of pledged securities of million  and collateralized mortgage obligations of million 
at december   we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately million from the fhlb 
in addition  at december  we had the following contingency funding sources available a million available line of credit with the fhlb  an unsecured line of credit of million with bankers bank  n 
e  and the ability to purchase up to million in fed funds 
during the year ended december   we did not utilize any of the three contingency funding sources 
on december   we had million of borrowings outstanding 
future growth of our loan portfolio resulting from our expansion efforts may require us to borrow additional funds 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  which consisted of million in commercial loan commitments  million of mortgage loan commitments  and  in home equity and consumer commitments  million in unadvanced construction loan commitments  million in unused lines of credit  and million in standby letters of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of certificates of deposit 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
the following table sets forth information relating to the company s payments due under contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more then five years long term debt operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities 
our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and fhlb advances 
deposit flows are 
table of contents affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit relationships 
occasionally  we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits 
capital management 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the fdic  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
total stockholders equity increased  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was mainly due to the decrease in unearned compensation and additional paid in capital of million  and decrease in unrealized losses associated with equities of million offset by the purchase of  shares in of the company s common stock through the company s stock repurchase program  at a cost of million for the year  and a net loss of million for the period 
the company s book value per share increased to at december  compared to at december  during  and we repurchased approximately million  or  shares  million  or  shares and million  or  shares  of our stock respectively 
in the future  we may also use other capital management tools such as cash dividends 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  letters of credit and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently have no plans to engage in hedging activities in the future 
for the years ended december  and december   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of inflation and changing prices 
the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
application of critical accounting policies 
our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and judgments
