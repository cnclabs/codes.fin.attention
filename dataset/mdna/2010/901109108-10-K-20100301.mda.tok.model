item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since we provide diversified general contracting  construction management and design build services to private clients and public agencies throughout the world 
our construction business is conducted through three basic segments or operations civil  building  and management services 
our civil segment specializes in public works construction and the repair  replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure  including highways  bridges  mass transit systems and water and wastewater treatment facilities  primarily in the western  northeastern and mid atlantic united states 
our building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets  including the hospitality and gaming  transportation  healthcare  municipal offices  sports and entertainment  educational  correctional facilities  biotech  pharmaceutical and high tech markets  and electrical and mechanical  plumbing and hvac services 
our management services segment provides diversified construction and design build services to the u 
s 
military and federal government agencies  as well as surety companies and multi national corporations in the united states and overseas 
the contracting and management services that we provide consist of general contracting  pre construction planning and comprehensive management services  including planning and scheduling the manpower  equipment  materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms and specifications contained in a construction contract 
we also offer self performed construction services including site work  concrete forming and placement  steel erection  electrical and mechanical  plumbing and hvac 
we provide these services by using traditional general contracting arrangements  such as fixed price  guaranteed maximum price and cost plus fee contracts and  to a lesser extent  construction management or design build contracting arrangements 
in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into arrangements with other contractors  referred to as joint ventures  for certain construction projects 
each of the joint venture participants is usually committed to supply a predetermined percentage of capital  as required  and to share in a predetermined percentage of the income or loss of the project 
generally  each joint venture participant is fully liable for the obligations of the joint venture 
for the year ended december   we achieved revenues of billion  income from construction operations of million and net income of million 
we received significant new contract awards  as well as additions to existing contracts  and ended the year with a contract backlog of billion 
at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  and a ratio of long term debt to equity of to 
our stockholders equity increased to billion as of december   reflecting the operating results achieved in  despite tough economic conditions 
recent developments amended credit facility on january   we entered into a second amendment to the third amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america 
the credit agreement allows us to borrow up to million on a revolving credit basis  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  and an additional million as of december  under a supplementary facility the supplementary facility to the extent that the million base facility has been fully drawn 
subject to certain conditions  we have the option to increase the base facility by up to an additional million 
this amendment and supplementary facility provides us with access to an additional source of liquidity 
for a description of additional material terms of the credit agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled financial commitments 
common stock repurchase program on november   our board of directors extended the common stock repurchase program put into place on november  the program allows us to repurchase up to million of our common stock through march  under the terms of the program  we may repurchase shares in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of any repurchase will be based on our evaluation of market conditions  business considerations and other factors 
we expect to use cash on hand to fund repurchases of our common stock 
stock repurchases will be conducted in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
repurchases also may be made under rule b plans  which would permit common stock to be purchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws 
the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock  and the program may be extended  modified  suspended or discontinued at any time  at our discretion 
during  we repurchased  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million under the program 
there were no repurchases made during tutor perini ranked as the second largest general building contractor and green contractor engineering news record enr ranked tutor perini corporation as the nation s largest general building contractor  second largest green building contractor  th largest us general contractor  and the number one builder of hotels  motels and convention centers  according to revenues 
perini building company delivers citycenter in december  perini building company  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed citycenter  the largest privately funded construction project in us history 
the project required approximately million man hours and is a acre development that includes aria resort casino  mandarin oriental  las vegas  vdara hotel spa  the harmon hotel  crystals retail entertainment district  and veer towers 
the project was completed on schedule 
backlog analysis for our backlog of uncompleted construction work at december  was approximately billion  as compared to the billion at december  the decrease in backlog during the year is a result of the anticipated substantial completion of large hospitality and gaming projects in las vegas  nevada  and the lack of new work acquired in the non residential building markets  partially offset by successful acquisition of new civil projects in california and new york 
the company expects to replace a portion of its high contract volume building projects with a growing share of new civil projects at a higher profit margin than what was earned prior to the merger with tutor saliba 
the following table provides an analysis of our backlog by business segment for the year ended december  backlog at new business revenue backlog at december  awarded recognized december  in millions building     civil  management services total new business awarded consists of the original contract price of projects added to our backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our construction business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts and our joint venture contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our projects  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that the method of accounting for contracts is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements and estimating potential liabilities in conjunction with certain contingencies  including the outcome of pending or future litigation  arbitration or other dispute resolution proceedings relating to contract claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow us to produce materially reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability of skilled contract labor  the performance of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of major subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have many contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other without impacting overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex construction projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue on contracts relating to unapproved change orders and claims  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount of costs incurred by us to date for contract price adjustments that we seek to collect from customers for delays  errors in specifications or designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to scope or price  or other unanticipated additional costs  in each case when recovery of the costs is considered probable 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
the settlement of these issues may take years depending upon whether the item can be resolved directly with the customer or involves litigation or arbitration 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
the amount of unapproved change order and claim revenue is included in our balance sheet as part of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings relating to unapproved change orders and claims included in our balance sheet at december  and is summarized below december  in thousands unapproved change orders claims of the balance of unapproved change orders and claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings at december  and december   approximately million and million respectively  are amounts subject to pending litigation or dispute resolution proceedings as described in item  legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements for the respective periods 
these amounts are management s estimate of the probable cost recovery from the disputed claims considering such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
in the event that future facts and circumstances  including the resolution of disputed claims  cause us to reduce the aggregate amount of our estimated probable cost recovery from the disputed claims  we will record the amount of such reduction against earnings in the relevant future period 
method of accounting for contracts revenues and profits from our contracts and construction joint venture contracts are recognized by applying percentages of completion for the period to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of the work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contracts 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is recorded during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
in the ordinary course of business  at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we prepare updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue  cost and profit or loss for each contract 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total forecasted revenue and costs  including unapproved change orders and claims  during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision become known 
the financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract 
an amount equal to the costs incurred that are attributable to unapproved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when realization is probable 
for a further discussion of unapproved change orders and claims  see item  business types of contracts and the contract process and item a  risk factors 
profit from unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the accounting period such amounts are resolved 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over contract billings to date 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings results when the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion accounting method  but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract and or costs  recorded at estimated realizable value  related to unapproved change orders or claims are incurred 
for unapproved change orders or claims that cannot be resolved in accordance with the normal change order process as defined in the contract  we may employ other dispute resolution methods  including mediation  binding and non binding arbitration  or litigation 
see item legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the prerequisite for billing unapproved change orders and claims is the final resolution and agreement between the parties 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings related to our contracts and joint venture contracts at december  is discussed above under use of estimates and in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  primarily trade names and contractor license  for impairment by applying a fair value test in the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets should be evaluated 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during  the company completed a reorganization enabling the company to realize greater operating efficiencies and take full advantage of the civil construction expertise acquired through the merger with tutor saliba 
as a result of the reorganization  the composition and number of reporting units has changed 
the company reallocated goodwill between its reorganized reporting units based on the relative fair value of pre reorganization reporting unit components distributed to post reorganization reporting units 
the number of reportable segments has not changed see note entitled business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
when testing goodwill  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment charge equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill  if any  over the implied fair value of goodwill 
to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  we primarily use the income approach which is based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future 
this income valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
we also use the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples of operating earnings 
when calculating impairment for intangible assets with indefinite lives  we compare the fair value of these assets  as determined based on the income and market valuation methods  to the carrying value 
the impairment charge equals the excess of the carrying value of the asset  if any  over its fair value 
there were no impairment charges recorded in fair value measurements we determined that we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities  valued at million as of december  all of these instruments are classified as available for sale securities as of december  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
in addition  we obtained an independent valuation of some of our auction rate security instruments and considered these valuations in determining the estimated fair values of the auction rate securities in our portfolio 
our analyses considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to full par value 
in conjunction with our estimates of fair value at december   we did not deem our investment in auction rate securities to be impaired 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
share based compensation we have granted restricted stock units and stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which corresponds to the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock option awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock option awards and the expected volatility of our stock price over the life of the awards 
we used the black scholes merton option pricing model to value our stock option awards  and utilized the historical volatility of our common stock as a reasonable estimate of the future volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the awards 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change which require the use of different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded through december  insurance liabilities we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of the losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverage 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
the estimate of our insurance liability within our self insured deductible limits includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on data compiled from historical experience 
actual experience could differ significantly from these estimates and could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we purchase varying levels of insurance from third parties  including excess liability insurance  to cover losses in excess of our self insured deductible limits 
currently  our self insured deductible limit for workers compensation  general liability and automobile coverage is generally million per occurrence 
in addition  on certain projects  we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of losses that arise from any subcontractor defaults 
our self insured deductible limit for subcontractor default on projects covered under our program is million per occurrence  subject to a million annual aggregate 
accounting for income taxes information relating to our provision for income taxes and the status of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in note  income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a key assumption in the determination of our book tax provision is the amount of the valuation allowance  if any  required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
we identified and reviewed potential tax uncertainties for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and determined that the exposure to those uncertainties did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as of december  defined benefit retirement plan the status of our defined benefit pension plan obligations  related plan assets and cost is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled employee benefit plans 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions which include  among other things  the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
the discount rate of used for purposes of computing the annual pension expense was determined at the beginning of the calendar year based upon an analysis performed by our actuaries which matches the cash flows of our plan s projected liabilities to bond investments of similar amounts and durations 
we plan to change the discount rate used for computing the annual pension expense to based upon a similar analysis by our actuaries 
the estimated return on plan assets is primarily based on historical long term returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our targeted allocation of plan assets equity and fixed income 
we plan to continue to use a return on asset rate of in based on projected equity and bond market performance compared to long term historical averages 
the plans benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets on december    and accordingly  our unfunded projected benefit obligation decreased million in  increased million in  and decreased million in  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  an increase reduction in stockholders equity 
effective june   all benefit accruals under our pension plan were frozen  however  the vested benefit was preserved 
due to the expected increase in amortization of prior years investment losses  we anticipate that pension expense will increase from million in to million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan are anticipated to be approximately million in cash contributions may vary significantly in the future depending upon asset performance and the interest rate environment 
results of operations compared to in  revenues decreased by million to  million and gross profit increased by million to million 
income from construction operations increased by million  from a loss of million to income of million 
net income increased by million  from a loss of million to income of million 
excluding the recognition of a million pretax million after tax non cash impairment charge relating to goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in  income from construction operations would have increased million from million 
the improvement of gross profit and income from construction operations primarily reflects the increased contribution of our civil segment and the addition of projects from the merger of tutor saliba and the acquisition of keating

revenues from construction operations the following table summarizes our revenues by segment 
revenues for the year ended december  increase decrease change in millions building civil management services total overall revenues decreased by million or  from  million in to  million in revenue increases in both the civil and management services segments were offset by a decrease in building construction revenues of million or 
the decrease in building construction revenues is due to the completion of several large building projects in such as citycenter  and was partially offset by the addition of million in revenues from a full year of projects acquired in the merger of tutor saliba and the acquisition of keating 
civil construction revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in  due to the acquisition of new work during  such as the i bridge replacement in shasta county  california and the caldecott tunnel project near oakland  california 
management services revenues also improved due to an increase in volume from new work  from million in to million in  an increase of million or

the following discussion of income from construction operations has been prepared on a pre impairment charge basis in order to enable users of this information to better compare normal operating results of each segment between the two periods 
since the impairment charge impacts only and does not affect revenues  cost of revenues or general expenses we incur to conduct our day to day construction operations  management believes the following discussion  analysis and comparison of and operating results is more meaningful to users when prepared on a pre impairment charge basis 
building construction income from operations before the impairment charge remained fairly consistent  increasing by million or  from million in to million in building construction income from operations  net of the impairment charge recorded in  decreased slightly due to a decrease in revenues discussed above  and was favorably impacted in by a higher margin on certain large public works projects 
civil construction income from operations before the impairment charge increased by million  or  from million in to million in our civil operations have been favorably impacted by a full year of tutor saliba operations and by an increase in mass transit projects acquired during in conjunction with the increase in revenues discussed above  management services contributed to our income from operations in management services income from operations before the impairment charge increased by million or  from million in to million in  primarily reflecting an increase in volume of work in guam due to a full year of tutor saliba operations in overall income from construction operations was unfavorably impacted by a million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a full year of tutor saliba general and administrative expenses  one time charges related to the acquisition of keating  and the integration of tutor saliba  net of other cost reduction activities in corporate services 
other income decreased by million  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to less interest income  which decreased by million as a result of lower average interest rates and a lower average investment balance during interest expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase was attributable to a temporary increase in borrowing under our revolving credit facility during and an increase in transportation equipment financing 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in taxable income 
the effective tax rate for was 
the decrease in the tax rate is a result of a favorable variance in permanent tax liability differences from current and prior years 
in  an effective tax rate of was applied to pretax operating income  excluding the goodwill impairment charge of million which is not tax deductible 
results of operations compared to in  revenues increased by  million to a record  million and gross profit increased by million 
income from construction operations decreased by million  from a profit of million to a loss of million  and net income decreased by million  from a profit of million to a loss of million  due to the recognition of a million pretax non cash impairment charge relating to goodwill and other intangible assets 
had we not had to record the impairment charge in  we would have achieved a record for income from construction operations and net income for the third consecutive year 
excluding the non cash impairment charge  our strong performance in was led by our building and management services segments 
in addition  our civil segment returned to profitability in the increase in revenues and profit before the impairment charge primarily reflects the conversion of our substantial building segment backlog into revenues and profit as expected and the impact of the merger with tutor saliba 
revenues for the year ended december  increase change in millions building civil management services total overall revenues increased by  million or  from  million in to  million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in building construction revenues of million or  from  million in to  million in  primarily as a result of the conversion of our substantial building segment backlog into revenues as expected  led by an increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming  healthcare and office building markets in las vegas and california 
the addition of tutor saliba in september resulted in an increase of million in building construction revenues in civil construction revenues increased by million or  from million to million in  due primarily to the addition of tutor saliba 
management services revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in  due to the addition of tutor saliba s black construction operation in guam and a slightly higher volume of work in iraq 
impact of impairment charge in our income from construction operations was materially impacted by a million pretax impairment charge 
this impairment charge reflects the write down to fair value of goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets initially recorded in connection with our merger with tutor saliba in september the pretax impairment charge related to the indefinite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill  amounted to a total of million  of which million related to the building segment  million related to the civil segment  and million related to the management services segment 
these indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names and various contractors licenses 
the pretax impairment charge related to goodwill amounted to a total of million  of which million related to the building segment and million related to the management services segment 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of in performing this test  we used the income method to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
due to the global financial crisis and significant global economic conditions experienced during the fourth quarter of  we experienced delays  postponements and reductions in scope of certain construction projects that we were anticipating to enter backlog in or as a result of these delays  postponements and reductions in scope  the projected cash flows of the tutor saliba reporting units decreased considerably from those initially anticipated prior to the completion of the merger  thereby resulting in a lower fair value of the tutor saliba reporting units and a corresponding impairment in the amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in connection with the merger 
these impairment charges relating to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are non cash and therefore do not affect our cash position  liquidity or have any impact on future operating results

since the impairment charge impacts only and does not affect revenues  cost of revenues or general expenses we incur to conduct our day to day construction operations  management believes the following discussion  analysis and comparison of and operating results is more meaningful to users when prepared on a pre impairment charge basis 
building construction income from operations before the impairment charge increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the significant increase in revenues discussed above  including the addition of tutor saliba 
building construction income from operations was reduced by a million increase in building construction related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to increases driven by changes in revenue volume and a million increase resulting from the addition of tutor saliba 
in addition  the increase in building construction related general and administrative expenses included a million increase due to marketing and preconstruction efforts relating to potential projects in dubai  and a million increase in amortization of stock based compensation 
civil construction income from operations before the impairment charge increased by million  from a loss of million in to a profit of million in the addition of tutor saliba made a significant positive impact on the civil construction income from operations along with improved operating results from both our new york civil and cherry hill operations 
the loss in was due primarily to recording a charge with respect to the matter discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
had that charge in not been recorded  the civil construction segment would still have experienced a loss from operations of approximately million due primarily to i downward profit adjustments recorded on a bridge rehabilitation project and on two mass transit projects in metropolitan new york  and ii an increase in civil construction related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to a decrease in the number of active projects  as well as an increase in legal fees relating to open legal matters 
in conjunction with the increase in revenues discussed above  management services contributed significantly to our income from operations in however  management services income from operations before the impairment charge decreased by million or  from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the extraordinary operating results recorded in due to favorable performance on work in iraq 
overall income from construction operations was favorably impacted by a million decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million decrease in corporate stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in through largely offsetting this decrease were increases in certain outside professional fees related to the audit of our financial statements and an increase in legal fees related to the matters discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income decreased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the recognition of a million loss due to the adjustment of certain of our investments in auction rate securities to fair value in  and a net loss of million in  as compared to a million net gain in  from the sale of certain parcels of developed land held for sale 
in addition  interest income decreased by million as a result of lower interest rates available on short term cash investments during interest expense increased by million  from million in to million in a reduction in interest expense due to the february repayment of our term loan in full was more than offset by increases in interest expense due to more extensive equipment financing in and to the million of outstanding debt assumed in conjunction with the merger with tutor saliba 
the provision for income taxes decreased by million  from million in to million in for  an effective tax rate of was applied to pretax operating income  excluding the goodwill impairment charge of million which is not tax deductible

potential impact of current economic conditions current economic and financial market conditions in the united states and overseas  including severe disruptions in the credit markets  have had an adverse affect on our results of operations 
if there is a prolonged economic recession or depression or if government efforts to stabilize and revitalize credit markets and financial institutions are not effective  current economic and financial market conditions could continue to adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 
the current instability in the financial markets has made it difficult for certain of our customers  including state and local governments  to access the credit markets to obtain financing or refinancing  as the case may be  to fund new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
state and local governments also are facing significant budget shortfalls as a result of declining tax and other revenues  which may cause them to defer or cancel planned infrastructure projects 
this situation has contributed to lower revenues in the billion decrease in our backlog during is the result of a lower volume of new work acquired as new projects have been deferred or delayed pending a turnaround in the economy  an improvement in the credit markets  and the release of funds for construction under the federal economic stimulus package 
we may encounter increased levels of deferrals and delays related to new construction projects in the future 
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets may increase the rate at which our customers defer  delay or cancel proposed new construction projects 
such deferrals  delays or cancellations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital on september   we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  as agent  which was amended by a joinder agreement dated february  and by a first amendment dated as of february  collectively the amended credit agreement 
for a description of the material terms of the amended credit agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amended credit agreement amends and replaces in its entirety a previously existing credit agreement dated february   as amended on may   and allows us to borrow up to million on a revolving credit basis the revolving facility  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  and an additional million under a supplementary facility the supplementary facility to the extent that the million base facility has been fully drawn 
this supplementary facility provides us with access to a source of liquidity should the need arise 
we have borrowed under the revolving credit facilities for a brief period during  and did not fully utilize the facility during  other than for letters of credit 
there are no borrowings outstanding at december  and  accordingly we had million available to borrow under the amended credit agreement  including outstanding letters of credit 
on january   the amended credit agreement was amended to increase the company s borrowing capacity by million  allowing the company to borrow up to million  for additional working capital and potential acquisitions  on a revolving credit basis and to favorably modify certain financial and other covenants  including setting the net worth covenant at billion as of december  there has been no change to the supplementary facility as a result of this amendment 
cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held by us as well as our proportionate share of amounts held by construction joint ventures 
cash held by us is available for general corporate purposes while cash held by construction joint ventures is available only for joint venture related uses 
joint venture cash and cash equivalents are not restricted to specific uses within those entities  however  the terms of the joint venture agreements limit our ability to distribute those funds and use them for corporate purposes 
cash held by construction joint ventures is distributed from time to time to us and to the other joint venture participants in accordance with our respective percentage interest after the joint venture partners determine that a cash distribution is prudent 
cash distributions received by us from our construction joint ventures are then available for general corporate purposes 
at december  and december   cash held by us and available for general corporate purposes was and million  respectively  and our proportionate share of cash held by joint ventures and available only for joint venture related uses was million and million  respectively 
billing procedures in the construction industry generally are based on the specific billing terms of a contract 
for example  billings may be based on various measures of performance  such as cubic yards excavated  architect s estimates of completion  costs incurred on cost plus type contracts or weighted progress from a cost loaded construction time schedule 
billings are generally on a monthly basis and are reviewed and approved by the customer prior to submission 
therefore  once a bill is submitted  we are generally able to collect amounts owed to us in accordance with the payment terms of the contract 
in addition  receivables of a contractor usually include retentions  or amounts that are held back until contracts are completed or until specified contract conditions or guarantees are met 
retentions are governed by contract provisions and are typically a fixed percentage for example  or of each billing 
we generally follow the policy of paying our vendors and subcontractors after we receive payment from our customer 
a summary of cash flows for each of the years ended december   and is set forth below year ended december  in millions cash flows provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year during  we used million in cash flow from operating activities 
the negative cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to the timing of receivables on certain large projects 
we used million in cash to fund investing activities  principally the purchase of property used in our building and management services segments  equipment to be used in our civil segment  and to fund the million acquisition of keating 
we received million in cash from our financing activities  principally from a million note collateralized by transportation equipment owned by us and two notes totaling million to finance the property acquisitions in guam 
our cash balance decreased by million during due to the use of cash in our operating and investing activities  which was primarily driven by an uncollected contract receivable from fontainebleau and timing related billings due to the start up of new projects and the cash disbursements associated with completing projects during the year 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
the positive cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues as well as favorable operating results in our civil and management services segments 
we used million in cash to fund investing activities  principally the purchase of auction rate securities  transportation and construction equipment to be used primarily in our civil construction operations  net of a million cash balance recorded in connection with the merger with tutor saliba because the consideration paid in the merger was equity and not cash 
we used million in cash to fund our financing activities  principally million for the repayment of shareholder notes payable assumed in the merger with tutor saliba  million for the repayment of debt  and million for the purchase of common stock in connection with our common stock repurchase program which was instituted in november the debt repayments include million of debt assumed in connection with the merger with tutor saliba 
due to the use of cash in our investing and financing activities  our cash balance decreased by million during during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
the substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities compared to is primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues as well as favorable operating results in our management services segment 
cash flow from operating activities was partly used to fund million in financing activities  primarily to pay in full the remaining million balance outstanding on our term loan in conjunction with the closing of our new revolving credit facility in february  and to pay down debt assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill  and to partly fund million in investing activities  principally for the purchase of construction equipment and property to be used in support of our building construction operations  and to purchase a net million of auction rate securities for short term investment purposes 
as a result  we increased our cash balance by million during working capital increased  from million at the end of to million at december  the amount of working capital would have been substantially higher at december   however  due to the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets and our likely inability to liquidate our investments in auction rate securities in the near term  we classified million of these investments as long term at december  for a description of our accounting for auction rate securities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the current ratio increased from x at december  to x at december  long term investments at december   we had investments in auction rate securities of million  which are reflected at fair value 
these investments are considered to be available for sale  and are classified as long term investments 
our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate many of our investments in auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  our anticipated operating cash flows  and our available credit facilities  we do not expect the short term lack of liquidity to affect our overall liquidity position or our ability to execute our current business plan 
we hold a variety of highly rated primarily aaa or aa interest bearing auction rate securities that generally represent interests in pools of either interest bearing student loans or municipal bond issues 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days 
in the event that such auctions are unsuccessful  the holder of the securities is not able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
an unsuccessful auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not signify a default by the issuer 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rates do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based upon a formula contained in the security  which rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
during the first quarter of  we made substantial additional investments in auction rate securities  with a total investment of million 
since mid february  regularly scheduled auctions for these securities started to fail throughout the market at a significant rate 
we have been successful in liquidating at par value a significant portion of our investment in auction rate securities and at december  we had investments in auction rate securities of million 
during  we determined that the carrying value of our auction rate securities reflected fair value and therefore did not recognize an impairment charge 
at december   we had investments in auction rate securities of million which are reflected at fair value after recognition of a million pretax impairment charge in of this million impairment charge  million was deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
the million balance of the impairment charge was deemed to be temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to stockholders equity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
long term debt long term debt  excluding current maturities of million  was million at december   an increase of million from december   due primarily to new long term debt agreements we entered into during for transportation equipment owed by the company of million and to finance building and land acquisitions for operations in guam of million 
our outstanding debt is secured by the underlying assets 
approximately million of the million in debt outstanding at december  carries interest at a fixed rate 
the long term debt to equity ratio was 
x at december   compared to 
x at december  contractual obligations our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years total debt  excluding interest a interest payments on debt operating leases  net purchase obligations unfunded pension liability total contractual obligations a includes capital leases in the amount of stockholders equity our book value per common share was at december   compared to at december   and at december  the major factors impacting stockholders equity during the three year period were the million shares issued in conjunction with the merger with tutor saliba  the net income loss recorded in all three years  the annual amortization of restricted stock compensation expense  common stock options and stock purchase warrants exercised  the income tax benefit attributable to stock based compensation 
also  we were required to adjust our accrued pension liability by a decrease of million in  an increase of million in  and a decrease of million in  respectively  and a cumulative increase of million in prior years  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss which resulted in an aggregate million pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss reduction in stockholders equity at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
adjustments to the amount of this accrued pension liability will be recorded in future years based upon periodic re evaluation of the funded status of our pension plans 
dividends there were no cash dividends declared or paid on our outstanding common stock during the three years ended december  related party transactions we are subject to certain related party transactions with our chairman and chief executive officer  ronald n

new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which clarifies the definition of fair value  describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value  and expands fair value disclosure requirements 
this guidance applies under other accounting pronouncements that currently require or permit fair value measurements 
we adopted this guidance on january   as required 
in february  the fasb issued a staff position which amends the fair value guidance by delaying its effective date by one year for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
therefore  we adopted the application of the fair value guidance relating to non financial assets and non financial liabilities on january  see note  fair value measurements for additional information 
in december  fasb issued new guidance on business combinations 
the new standard provides revised guidance on how an acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
this guidance also provides direction for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
it was effective for us beginning january  and the company applied the provisions of this guidance to an acquisition completed in january see note of the consolidated balance sheets 
in march  the fasb issued guidance regarding disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this guidance was effective for us on january  and applies only to financial statement disclosures 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued a staff position which requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of defined benefit plan assets that are similar to the disclosures about fair value measurements required by the new fair value guidance 
it is effective for our annual financial statements 
since the staff position only requires enhanced disclosures  the implementation of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued a staff position providing additional guidance on factors to consider in determining whether a transaction is orderly when the volume and level of market activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased 
it was effective for us beginning april  the staff position affirms that the objective of fair value when the market for an asset is not active is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
it applies to all fair value measurements when appropriate 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued a staff position amending existing guidance for determining whether an other than temporary impairment of debt securities has occurred 
among other changes  the fasb replaced the existing requirement that an entity s management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery with a requirement that management assert a it does not have the intent to sell the security  and b it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
we adopted the provisions of the staff position beginning april  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued a staff position requiring fair value disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements 
we adopted the provisions of the staff position beginning april  other than the required disclosures  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb accounting standards codification asc was issued and became the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the historical gaap hierarchy was eliminated and the asc became the only level of authoritative gaap 
all other literature not included in the codification will be considered non authoritative 
asc is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the implementation of the asc did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement and our short term and long term investment portfolios 
our revolving credit agreement is available for us to borrow  when needed  for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate  as defined  and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
during  we borrowed under our revolving credit facilities for a brief period 
our outstanding debt at december  totaled million  of which approximately million carries interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  we do not believe our liquidity or our operations are subject to significant market risk for changes in interest rates 
we hold a variety of highly rated primarily aaa or aa interest bearing auction rate securities that generally represent interests in pools of either interest bearing student loans or municipal bond issues 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days 
in the event that such auctions are unsuccessful  the holder of the securities is not able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
an unsuccessful auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not signify a default by the issuer 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rates do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based upon a formula contained in the security  which rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
since mid february  regularly scheduled auctions for these securities started to fail throughout the market at a significant rate 
at that time  we had million invested in auction rate securities 
since then  we have been successful in liquidating at par value a significant portion of our investment in auction rate securities 
we recorded a million pretax impairment charge in of this million impairment charge  million was deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
the million balance of the impairment charge was deemed to be temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to stockholders equity 
at december   we had investments in auction rate securities of million which are reflected at fair value 
these investments are considered to be available for sale and are classified as long term investments 
our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate many of our investments in auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  our anticipated operating cash flows  and our available revolving facility and our supplemental facility discussed above  we do not expect that the short term lack of liquidity of our auction rate security investments will materially affect our overall liquidity position or our ability to execute our current business plan
