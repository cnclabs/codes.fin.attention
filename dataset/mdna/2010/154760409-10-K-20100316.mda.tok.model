item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
by deferring these payments and pursuant to the terms of the tarp preferred stock  our ability to pay dividends with respect to common stock  subject to approval from the frbsf  the dfi and the us treasury  is restricted until our obligations under our tarp preferred stock and trust preferred securities are brought current 
the deferral of these payments may also  among other things  require us to satisfy these obligations before they otherwise would have become due or restrict us in our commercial activities 
at december   central pacific bank was not in compliance with certain aspects of the consent order and the mou  including the elevated capital ratios required to be met by march  if the bank is unable to improve its capital position  in addition to the risks discussed above under we are subject to a number of requirements and prohibitions under the consent order and the mou and may be subject to additional limitations on our business and additional regulatory actions  including a federal conservatorship or receivership for the bank  if we cannot comply with the consent order and the mou or if our financial condition continues to deteriorate  it could have a negative impact on customer confidence  employee retention  our costs of funds and fdic insurance costs  and our business  results of operations and financial conditions  generally 
in addition  our bank s ability to accept brokered deposits has been restricted  and the interest rates we may pay are constrained  both of which could impact our liquidity 
our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that our loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral or guarantees securing these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment 
during  our provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million  compared to million in and million in our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses 
we may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  which are regularly reevaluated and are based in part on current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential loan losses and the present level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  results of examinations of our loan portfolios by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the size of the allowance  we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio  our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions  as well as the requirements of the consent order 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance may not be sufficient 
with the volatility of the economic decline and unprecedented nature of the events in the credit and real estate markets during the latter part of  we made significant adjustments to our allowance in in  we made significant additional adjustments to our allowance due to our high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans  as well as the ongoing economic downturn and the deterioration in the hawaii and california real estate markets 
we may need to make additional adjustments in our allowance for the remainder of  and possibly beyond  due to the anticipated ongoing deterioration in the local and national real estate markets and economies 
in addition  third parties  including our federal and state regulators  periodically evaluate the adequacy of our allowance and there is a risk that their assumptions and conclusions may differ from ours 
as a result of these external reviews  we may be required to assign different grades to specific credits  increase our provision for loan and lease losses  and or recognize further loan charge offs based on judgments different than ours 
specifically  the consent order requires the bank to maintain an adequate allowance at all times and requires us to immediately charge off all assets that our regulators classify as loss and one half the assets they classify as doubtful 
as required by the consent order  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized million in incremental charge offs and a resultant increase in the provision for loan losses related to certain loans 
any further increase in our allowance or loan charge offs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our regulators have not approved our appointment of mr 
dean as our executive chairman 
on march   we announced the appointment of mr 
dean as executive chairman of the boards of cpf and the bank  which appointment will become effective upon the receipt of regulatory approval 
senior management will report to mr 
dean 
in the interim pending regulatory approval  mr 
dean will serve in an acting role in such positions 
also on march   mr 
migita announced his retirement as president  chief executive officer and chairman of the boards of cpf and the bank 
mr 
migita will remain a director of cpf and the bank 
mr 
dean s appointment is subject to approval by our regulators and we cannot assure you that our regulators will grant their approval 
if our regulators do not approve of mr 
dean s appointment  we will need to recruit other candidates to lead the turnaround of our company and we may not be able to do so on any given timeframe 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people 
there are a limited number of qualified persons in hawaii with the knowledge and experience required to successfully implement our recovery plan 
the more senior the executive  the more difficult it is to locate suitable candidates in the local market 
accordingly  in many circumstances  it is necessary for us to recruit potential candidates from the mainland 
at this time  new senior executives are required to be approved by our regulators 
suitable candidates for positions may decline to consider employment with the company given its current financial condition and the existing uncertainties  particularly since in some circumstances  this would require that the employee relocate from the mainland to hawaii  where other employment opportunities in the banking industry may be limited 
in addition  in the current circumstances  it may be difficult for us to offer compensation packages that would be sufficient to convince candidates that are acceptable to our regulators and meet our requirements to agree to become our employee and or relocate 
our financial condition and the existing uncertainties may result in existing employees seeking positions at other companies where these issues are not present 
the unexpected loss of services of other key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of a loss of their skills  knowledge of our market and years of industry experience 
if we are not able to promptly recruit qualified personnel  which we require to conduct our operations  our business and our ability to successfully implement our recovery plan could be adversely affected 
we may experience further impairment of our goodwill  which would adversely impact our results of operations 
in  we wrote off all of the remaining goodwill associated with our commercial real estate reporting unit and in we wrote off million of goodwill associated with our hawaii market reporting unit as it was considered to be impaired at that time 
we continue to evaluate the remaining million of goodwill assigned to our hawaii market reporting unit for impairment 
given the uncertainty surrounding our ability to comply with the terms of the consent order  there is a high likelihood that the remaining balance of our goodwill may be impaired as of march  additionally  further declines in our stock price and other factors such as the performance of our hawaii market reporting unit will also need to be considered in our evaluation of goodwill during the first quarter of the price of our common stock has declined significantly and is volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has declined significantly since february when our stock price traded above per share 
on march   the closing price of our common stock was per share 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are our ability to continue as a going concern  failure to comply with the requirements of the consent order with the fdic and the dfi and the possibility of resulting action by the regulators  further deterioration of asset quality  the incurrence of continuing losses  suspension of trading of our common stock on or delisting from the nyse if we become non compliant with continuing listing standards  including the minimum price rule  removal of our common stock from certain market indices  such as the removal of our common stock from the s p small cap  actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition  changes in revenue or earnings losses estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts  failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings losses estimates  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  actions by institutional shareholders  additions or departures of key personnel  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  future sales of our common stock  including sales of our common stock in short sale transactions  general market conditions and  in particular  developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry  proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments  anticipated or pending investigations  proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us  or domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock market and  in particular  the market for financial institution stocks  has experienced significant volatility over the past year 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur 
accordingly  the shares of our common stock that an investor purchases may trade at a price lower than that at which they were purchased 
the trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors  which may change from time to time  including  without limitation  our financial condition  performance  creditworthiness and prospects  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  and other factors 
volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent individual shareholders from being able to sell their shares when they want or at prices they find attractive 
a significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation 
our common stock is equity and therefore is subordinate to our subsidiaries indebtedness and preferred stock 
shares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness 
as such  shares of the common stock will rank junior to all current and future indebtedness and other non equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us  including in the event of our liquidation 
we may  and central pacific bank and our other subsidiaries may also  incur additional indebtedness from time to time and may increase our aggregate level of outstanding indebtedness 
additionally  holders of our common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock then outstanding 
under the terms of the tarp preferred stock  because we have deferred dividends on the tarp preferred stock  our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock  subject to approval from the frbsf and the dfi  is restricted until our obligations under our tarp preferred stock as well as our trust preferred securities are brought current 
in addition  prior to the earlier of february  and the date on which shares of the tarp preferred stock have been redeemed in whole or the us treasury has transferred all of the tarp preferred stock it purchased under the cpp to third parties  neither central pacific financial corp 
nor any subsidiary may  without consent of the us treasury  pay cash dividends on our common stock in excess of per share or redeem  purchase or acquire any shares of common stock  other equity securities or any trust preferred securities 
in any event  we would not be in a position to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future 
our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
if we issue preferred shares in the future that have a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  then the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
there is a limited trading market for our common stock and as a result  you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nyse  the volume of trading in our common stock is lower than many other companies listed on the nyse 
a public trading market with depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given our current stock price levels  we are at risk of falling under the nyse s minimum stock price rule  in which case  our common stock may be subject to suspension of trading and delisting from the nyse 
in the event this occurs and we are not able to cure this deficiency  it would further reduce the market liquidity of our common stock 
by deferring payments on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures  we are prohibited from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing our common stock or preferred stock or making any payment on outstanding debt obligations that rank equally with or junior to the junior subordinated debentures 
on august   we began deferring regularly scheduled interest payments on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debentures prohibit us from declaring or paying cash dividends on or repurchasing our common stock or preferred stock or making any payment on outstanding debt obligations that rank equally with or junior to the junior subordinated debentures  while we have deferred interest thereunder 
future dividend payments and common stock repurchases are restricted by the terms of the us treasury s equity investment in us 
under the terms of the tarp s cpp  while the tarp preferred stock is outstanding  we are prohibited from increasing quarterly cash dividends on our common stock above per share  and from making certain repurchases of our common stock  other equity securities and the trust preferred securities without the us treasury s consent until the earlier of february  and the date on which shares of the tarp preferred stock are redeemed in whole or the us treasury has transferred all of the tarp preferred stock it purchased under the cpp to third parties 
furthermore  as long as the tarp preferred stock issued to the us treasury is outstanding  dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to our common stock  other equity securities or the trust preferred securities are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on the tarp preferred stock  subject to certain limited exceptions 
in the third quarter of  we suspended the payment of cash dividends on our tarp preferred stock 
as such  we are unable to pay dividends on our common stock unless these dividends are brought current 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the tarp warrant  could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
the shares of tarp preferred stock issued to the us treasury impact net income available to our common shareholders and earnings per common share  and the tarp warrant issued to the us treasury to purchase up to  shares of our voting common stock at an exercise price of per share may be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
the dividends declared or accrued and deferred  as well as the accretion on discount on the tarp preferred stock issued to the us treasury  will reduce the net income available to holders of common stock and our earnings per share 
the tarp preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up of our company 
additionally  the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the tarp warrant is exercised 
although the us treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the tarp warrant  a transferee of any portion of the tarp warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the tarp warrant is not bound by this restriction 
because of our participation in the tarp s cpp  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives 
pursuant to the terms of the tarp cpp  we adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the us treasury holds an investment in us 
these standards generally apply to our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers 
the standards include ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of million for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation will likely increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods and may make it more difficult to attract suitable candidates to serve as executive officers  including a new chief executive officer 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
like most financial institutions  our earnings and profitability depend significantly on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us and our earnings may be negatively affected 
in light of our current volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  our interest rate margin could be expected to increase during periods of rising interest rates and  conversely  to decline during periods of falling interest rates 
we are unable to predict or control fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by many factors  including the following inflation  recession  changes in unemployment  the money supply  international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets  and governmental actions 
our asset liability management strategy may not be able to control our risk from changes in market interest rates and it may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time  we may reposition our investment portfolio to reduce our net interest income volatility 
see asset liability management and interest rate risk included in part ii  item for a further discussion of our sensitivity to interest rate changes 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and community banks within the various markets we operate 
additionally  various out of state banks conduct significant business in the market areas in which we currently operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to its competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern may also affect our competitiveness 
customers may decide not to do business with the bank due to its financial condition and questions as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
in addition  we have and continue to face additional regulatory restrictions that our competitors may not be subject to  including reducing our commercial real estate loan portfolio  improving the overall risk profile of the company and restrictions on the amount of interest we can pay on deposit accounts  which could adversely impact our ability to compete and attract and retain customers 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our deposit customers may pursue alternatives to deposits at our bank or seek higher yielding deposits causing us to incur increased funding costs 
we are facing increasing deposit pricing pressures 
checking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market or other non depository investments as providing superior expected returns or seek to spread their deposits over several banks to maximize fdic insurance coverage 
furthermore  technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments including products offered by other financial institutions or non bank service providers 
additional increases in short term interest rates could increase transfers of deposits to higher yielding deposits 
efforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits  including deposit pricing  can increase our costs 
when bank customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher yielding deposits  or spread their accounts over several banks  we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds  thus increasing our funding costs 
the financial condition of our bank compared to other top hawaiian financial institutions  as well as our ability to continue as a going concern  may affect our customer s decisions to keep their deposit accounts with us 
in addition to the consent order and the mou  governmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may further impair our operations or restrict our growth 
in addition to the requirements of the consent order and the mou  we are subject to significant governmental supervision and regulation 
these regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
statutes and regulations affecting our business may be changed at any time and the interpretation of these statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change 
within the last several years  congress and the president have passed and enacted significant changes to these statutes and regulations 
there can be no assurance that such changes to the statutes and regulations or to their interpretation will not adversely affect our business 
in addition to governmental supervision and regulation  we are subject to changes in other federal and state laws  including changes in tax laws  which could materially affect the banking industry 
we are subject to the rules and regulations of the frb  fdic and dfi 
if we fail to comply with federal and state bank regulations  the regulators may limit our activities or growth  impose fines on us or ultimately cease our operations 
banking laws and regulations change from time to time 
bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated in the same manner or are less regulated 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies regulate many aspects of our operations 
these areas include the capital that must be maintained  the kinds of activities that can be engaged in  the kinds and amounts of investments that can be made  the locations of offices  insurance of deposits and the premiums that we must pay for this insurance  and how much cash we must set aside as reserves for deposits 
bank regulatory authorities have the authority to bring enforcement actions against banks and bank holding companies for unsafe or unsound practices in the conduct of their businesses or for violations of any law  rule or regulation  any condition imposed in writing by the appropriate bank regulatory agency or any written agreement with the authority 
possible enforcement actions against us could include a federal conservatorship or receivership for the bank  the issuance of additional orders that could be judicially enforced  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the issuance of directives to enter into a strategic transaction  whether by merger or otherwise  with a third party  the termination of insurance of deposits  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders 
the fiscal  monetary and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments  both of which affect the net interest margin 
it also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold  such as debt securities 
its policies also can adversely affect borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
additionally  in june of  the obama administration proposed a wide range of regulatory reforms that  if enacted  may have significant effects on the financial services industry in the united states 
if enacted  the proposals would significantly alter not only how financial firms are regulated but also how they conduct their business 
changes in frb policies and our regulatory environment generally are beyond our control  and we are unable to predict what changes may occur or the manner in which any future changes may affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
failure of legislative and regulatory initiatives to maintain stability in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect us 
recent legislative and regulatory initiatives to address difficult market and economic conditions may not stabilize the us banking system 
on october   president bush signed into law the eesa in response to the current crisis in the financial sector 
the us treasury and banking regulators have implemented and are continuing to propose a number of programs under this legislation to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  including the provision of direct and indirect assistance to distressed financial institutions  assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker dealers  implementation of programs by the frb to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets and other matters 
additionally  in june of  the obama administration proposed a wide range of regulatory reforms that  if enacted  may have significant effects on the financial services industry in the united states 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual long term impact that the eesa will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability that were experienced through the beginning of although the financial markets have begun to stabilize  a failure by the eesa to maintain stabilization in the financial markets and a worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the value of our securities 
increases in deposit insurance premiums and special fdic assessments will decrease our future earnings 
in may of  the fdic announced that it had voted to levy a special assessment on insured institutions in order to facilitate the rebuilding of the deposit insurance fund 
the assessment  which was payable on september   is in addition to a planned increase in premiums and a change in the way regular premiums are assessed  which the fdic previously approved 
the cost of the special assessment was equal to five basis points of central pacific bank s total assets minus tier capital as of june  and resulted in a charge of approximately million 
on november   the fdic issued new assessment regulations that require fdic insured institutions to prepay on december  their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter and for all of  and  however certain financial institutions  including our bank  were exempted from the new prepayment regulations and will continue to pay their risk based assessments on a quarterly basis 
the recent assessment increases and special assessment discussed above  along with any future assessment increases and or special assessments applicable to the bank  may continue to increase our expenses and adversely impact our earnings 
the value of certain securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in the market for these securities 
the market for certain investment securities held within our investment portfolio has become much less liquid over the past two years 
this coupled with uncertainty surrounding the credit risk associated with the underlying collateral has caused discrepancies in valuation estimates obtained from third parties 
we value some of our investments using cash flow and valuation models which include certain subjective estimates that we believe are reflective of the estimates a purchaser of such securities would use if such a transaction were to occur 
the volatile market may affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks  in addition to interest rate risk typically associated with these securities 
there can be no assurance that declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in impairment of these assets that may result in accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on consolidated financial statements and capital ratios 
if our investment in the fhlb is classified as other than temporarily impaired or as permanently impaired  our earnings and shareholders equity could decrease 
we own common stock of the fhlb to qualify for membership in the federal home loan bank system and to be eligible to borrow funds under the fhlb s advance program 
the aggregate cost of our fhlb common stock as of december  was million based on its par value 
there is no market for our fhlb common stock 
as a condition of membership at the fhlb  we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of fhlb common stock 
our stock purchase requirement is based  in part  upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the fhlb and is calculated in accordance with the capital plan of the fhlb 
our fhlb stock has a par value of  is carried at cost  and it is subject to the guidance of accounting standards codification asc the fhlb announced that it had a risk based capital deficiency under the regulations of the federal housing finance agency the fhfa  its primary regulator  as of december   and that it would suspend future dividends and the repurchase and redemption of outstanding common stock 
as a result  the fhlb has not paid a dividend since the fourth quarter of the fhlb has communicated that it believes the calculation of risk based capital under the current rules of the fhfa significantly overstates the market risk of the fhlb s private label mortgage backed securities in the current market environment and that it has enough capital to cover the risks reflected in its balance sheet 
as a result  we have not recorded an other than temporary impairment on our investment in fhlb stock 
however  continued deterioration in the fhlb s financial position may result in impairment in the value of those securities 
we will continue to monitor the financial condition of the fhlb as it relates to  among other things  the recoverability of our investment 
our business could be adversely affected by unfavorable actions from rating agencies 
ratings assigned by ratings agencies to us  our affiliates or our securities may impact the decision of certain customers  in particular  institutions  to do business with us 
a rating downgrade or a negative rating could adversely affect our deposits and our business relationships 
on august   fitch ratings downgraded the long term issuer default ratings of cpf and central pacific bank to ccc and b  respectively  and revised the rating outlook for central pacific bank to negative 
on september   fitch ratings also downgraded the ratings of our trust preferred securities to cc to reflect the deferral of dividend payments on these securities 
on november   fitch ratings further downgraded the long term issuer default ratings of central pacific bank to ccc 
these ratings downgrade may contribute to a loss of deposits and further downgrades to us  our affiliates or our securities and could further reduce deposits and result in the loss of relationships 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
because we are a holding company with no significant operations other than our bank  we currently depend upon dividends from our bank for a substantial portion of our revenues 
our ability to pay dividends will therefore continue to depend in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from our bank 
our bank is currently prohibited from paying dividends because of a million deficit in its retained earnings 
the bank will not be able to pay any future dividends until it has positive retained earnings 
accordingly  we will not be able to rely upon dividends from the bank for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the ability of the bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to us is subject to the regulatory authority of the frbsf  the fdic  the dfi and hawaii law as further described under part i  item supervision and regulation dividends 
as a result of the mou  cash dividends by the bank to cpf require prior approval from the fdic and dfi 
the regulators have not permitted the bank to pay dividends to cpf since april our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 
from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
regardless of whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services  as well as impact customer demand for our products and services 
any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
