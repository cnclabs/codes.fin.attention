in october  webster acquired milburn distributions  inc  the largest distributor specializing in the us equine veterinary supply market 
milburn s annualized sales exceed million 
the company operates facilities in arizona  kentucky  texas and florida 
most companion pet and large animal veterinary supply distributors have not successfully served the nation s equine veterinarians due to the highly specialized nature of this niche market

emphasizing value added  full service capabilities 
webster believes that veterinary customers value full service and responsive delivery of product  in addition to competitive prices 
customers also increasingly expect suppliers to be knowledgeable about products and services  and generally a superior sales representative can create a special relationship with the practitioner by providing an informational link to the overall industry 
webster s knowledgeable sales representatives assist customers in the selection and purchasing of supplies 
most veterinarians are independent  or small unit based  practitioners who are unable to store and manage large 
table of contents volumes of supplies in their offices 
webster meets its customer s requirements by delivering frequent  small quantity orders rapidly and reliably from strategically located distribution centers

sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry  assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products  and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories 
each representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location branch manager 
sales representatives are employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis  with some  less experienced  representatives receiving a base salary and commission

competition within the companion pet market segment  competitors range from small local distributors to large national and regional full service companies  and to a lesser extent  mail order distributors or buying groups

in addition  given the relatively small average size approximately  patterson medical s products often do not represent a major expense category for its customers 
in march  patterson medical completed the acquisition of the smith nephew rehabilitation snr division of smith nephew plc  and in doing so  acquired the rolyan  homecraft and kinetec brand names 
the snr acquisition added  additional products  as well as a broad array of other brand names and proprietary products

approximately of its revenue is in north america 
patterson medical believes the rehabilitation medical supplies and assistive products industry is approximately billion worldwide and is expected to grow faster than the overall economy over the next several years 
industry growth is driven by strong growth in the physical and occupational therapy markets and favorable demographic trends associated with the aging of the baby boom generation 
patterson medical does not compete in motorized wheelchairs or scooters  a market estimated to be a combined billion worldwide 
therefore  patterson medical s addressable market defined as the collective market for products sold by patterson medical is approximately billion worldwide 
patterson medical believes that it has an industry leading market share of approximately in a highly fragmented rehabilitation and assistive products market 
patterson medical believes that the demand for rehabilitation products will continue to be influenced by the following factors favorable demographics 
favorable demographic trends such as extended life expectancy  active lifestyles and a general willingness to spend discretionary income on health care and well being  are expected to contribute to increased demand for products distributed by patterson medical 
specifically  the aging baby boomer population  together with their increased disposable income and desire for 
table of contents independence  will fuel product purchases to assist with the frailties associated with old age and provide sustained sales growth 
the us census bureau has projected the and older population in the us to increase significantly  from less than million in to million by and million by the to year old population is expected to more than double between and current trends indicate that these age groups represent the majority of home and community based health care patients 
the aging of the population is a revenue growth driver because approximately of people over the age of and approximately of people over the age of need assistance with everyday activities 
patterson medical believes it is well positioned to benefit from this trend by providing aids to daily living  namely dressing devices  toileting  dining  bathing aids  and grooming devices  all of which promote greater patient independence  improved patient responsibility and improved responsiveness to treatment 
increasing number of pts and ots  patterson medical s primary user groups 
according to the us department of labor occupational outlook handbook  there were approximately  pts and  ots in the us in approximately percent of pts were employed in either hospitals or offices of physical therapists

the majority of ots work in hospitals  including many in rehabilitation and psychiatric hospitals 
the remaining ots work in outpatient occupational therapy offices and clinics  schools  home health agencies  nursing homes  community mental health centers  adult day care programs  job training services and residential care facilities

increasing frequency of reconstructive and implant surgery 
another important driver of the growth in the pt market is the growing need for rehabilitation products resulting from the increasing frequency of reconstructive implant procedures  including hip and knee replacements 
the worldwide reconstructive implant market is currently in excess of billion and expected to grow between and annually 
this growth trajectory is largely driven by favorable demographics  as patient populations are expanding at both ends of the age spectrum 
among seniors  more active lifestyles and longer life expectancies are responsible for the increasing frequency of reconstructive implants 
younger patients are opting for reconstructive implants over less invasive alternatives due to improved and longer lasting implant technology 
patterson medical believes it is well positioned to benefit from the growth in reconstructive implants  by providing orthopedic products  namely continuous passive motion machines and splinting  which are critical to post operatory rehabilitation

our international operations are subject to risks that could adversely affect our operating results 
there are a number of risks inherent in foreign operations  which include regulatory  economic and political requirements and changes 
additionally  foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 
our future operating results can be affected by our relationships with our sales representatives and vendors and manufacturers of products that we distribute 
the inability to attract or retain qualified sales personnel or build or maintain relationships with vendors and manufacturers of products that we distribute may have an adverse effect on our business 
interruptions with our vendors could adversely affect our operating results

if a vendor is unable to deliver product in a timely and efficient manner  whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons  we could experience lost sales 
in addition  a portion of our products are sourced  directly or indirectly  from outside the united states 
political or financial instability  increased tariffs  restrictions on trade  currency exchange rates  labor unrest  outbreak of pandemics or other events could slow distribution activities and affect foreign trade beyond our control and adversely affect our results of operations 
we sell products that could be subject to market and technological obsolescence 
we carry over  different product stock keeping units 
some of these products are subject to technological obsolescence that may not be within the control of the company since we do not manufacture the products 
if we were no longer able to sell these products due to customers making decisions not to buy them  we may have to record expense related to the diminution in value of inventories we have in stock that would adversely impact our operating results 
audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal  state and local tax authorities and by non us tax authorities 
if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves  our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 
we are subject to a variety of litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business  including claims for damages arising out of the use of products we distribute  claims relating to intellectual property matters  and claims involving 
table of contents employment matters 
we also may be subject to securities litigation  although we have no reason to believe that any cause for such action exists today 
the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management s attention  we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits  and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
leadership development and succession planning our business could suffer if it loses key personnel unexpectedly or fails to provide for an orderly management succession 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to recruit skilled personnel for the business  and then identify and train our personnel for their transition into key roles to support the long term growth of the business 
while our board of directors and management actively monitor our succession plan and processes  any sudden change at the senior management level may adversely affect our business 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  if impairment of our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets is determined we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period of such determination 
we are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates 
our balance sheet includes some variable rate long term debt and certain non current assets that are sensitive to movements in short term interest rates 
the variable rates are comprised of libor plus a spread and reset on certain dates  as prescribed by the respective agreements 
in addition  our balance sheet includes fixed rate long term debt  whose fair value could be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
we finance purchases by our customers using finance contracts that are issued at fixed interest rates  and sell these contracts under various funding arrangements that are priced using variable interest rates 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if there are sudden and dramatic changes in the interest rates within the markets

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s fiscal financial information is summarized in this management s discussion and analysis  the consolidated financial statements  and the related notes 
the following background is essential to more fully understand the company s financial information 
patterson operates a distribution business in three complementary markets dental supply  veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply 
historically the company s strategy for growth focused on internal growth and the acquisition of smaller distributors and businesses offering related products and services to the dental market 
in fiscal  the company expanded its strategy to take advantage of a parallel growth opportunity in the veterinary supply market by acquiring the assets of j 
a 
webster  inc on july  the company added a third component to its business platform in fiscal when it entered the rehabilitation supply market with the acquisition of abilityone products corp 
abilityone on september  abilityone is now known as patterson medical 
operating margins of the veterinary business are considerably lower than the dental and rehabilitation supply businesses 
while operating expenses run at a lower rate in the veterinary business  its gross margin is substantially lower 
over the past three years  the veterinary business has grown at a faster rate than the other two businesses  resulting in dilution of the consolidated operating margin 
there are several important aspects of the company s business that are useful in analyzing the company  including market growth in the various markets it operates  internal growth  growth through acquisition  and continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency 
management defines internal growth as the increase in net sales from period to period  excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  and excluding the net sales  for a period of twelve months following the transaction date  of businesses that it has acquired 
the company operates with a week accounting convention with its fiscal year ending on the last saturday in april 
the fiscal years ending in  and were all comprised of weeks 
in fiscal  the company will report weeks of operations 
during fiscal  the company executed a series of transactions that effectively changed our capital structure  lowering our weighted average cost of capital by almost basis points  and positioned the company to increase returns to our shareholders 
first  the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock on the open market and through an accelerated share repurchase agreement for approximately million 
a portion of the funding for the share repurchases came from debt issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal  consisting of fixed rate private placement notes totaling million and a variable rate term loan of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company initiated a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
the company currently expects to continue paying a quarterly cash dividend into the foreseeable future 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations over the past three fiscal years as a percent of sales net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses operating income other income  net interest expense income before taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
fiscal consolidated sales were  million  an increase of compared to  million in fiscal acquisitions contributed to sales growth  resulting mostly from acquisitions by the veterinary and rehabilitation units 
fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates contributed to sales growth 
during both fiscal and  sales at each of our business units were adversely affected by the recession and slow economic recovery 
the company believes the weakness in the general economy will continue to affect our performance in fiscal sales of our consolidated dental supply unit were  million  a decrease of from  million in fiscal fluctuations in foreign currency rates related to our dental operations in canada and the contribution from acquisitions had a favorable impact on fiscal sales of and  respectively 
sales of dental consumable supplies decreased to  million 
beginning late in the first half of fiscal and continuing throughout fiscal  the sales of consumables have been affected by reduced discretionary spending and high levels of unemployment resulting from the general economic conditions  particularly in the united states 
dental equipment sales declined in fiscal to million 
we believe the weak economy has caused many dental practitioners to focus their investment dollars on equipment with rapid and high rates of return 
sales of basic equipment were lower in fiscal  while sales of cerec d dental restorative systems rose 
within the basic equipment category  certain technology products with rapid rates of return such as digital imaging systems sensors  panoramic and cone beam units outperformed core equipment such as chairs  power units and cabinetry

operating expenses 
the consolidated operating expense ratio in fiscal was  or basis points higher than fiscal in the second half of fiscal and continuing throughout fiscal  the company took steps involving a range of cost control initiatives including a hiring freeze except in the area of sales representatives  a wage freeze and restrictions on travel and other more discretionary expenses 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company enacted company wide salary reductions 
while these measures have slowed expense growth  their impact was lessened by acquisition related expenses  including amortization expense  and higher levels of incentive compensation based on achievement of operating targets for the current year 
the dental unit s operating expense ratio increased basis points  reflecting increased fixed costs on lower sales volume and expense related to acquisitions completed over the past two years 
the ratio of the veterinary unit s operating expenses as a percent of sales improved basis points  primarily due to leverage on higher sales 
patterson medical s operating expense ratio increased in fiscal due primarily to the cost structure of recent acquisitions

dental equipment sales declined in fiscal  including a decrease in basic equipment 
sales of cerec d dental restorative systems were lower in fiscal  but did grow in the second half of fiscal cerec system sales in the second half of the year benefitted from promotional financing arrangements which were made available to qualified customers  as well the january introduction of a new digital image acquisition unit by the manufacturer  sirona dental systems  that provides significantly greater ease of use and imaging precision

in addition  the gross margin of columbus is somewhat lower than the historical webster veterinary gross margin 
the dental segment s gross margin was unchanged from fiscal gross margin of the veterinary unit declined basis points in fiscal  due mostly to lower levels of vendor rebates earned and the lower columbus gross margins

operating activities generated cash of million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in the second half of fiscal  the company invested in a financing program to support marketing efforts directed at the cerec product line 
at the end of fiscal  this promotion  which ended at the close of fiscal  had generated approximately million of finance contracts that the company could not immediately sell to our funding sources due to certain requirements in those funding arrangements 
in fiscal  the company invested in similar financing programs  but to a lesser degree 
as of april   the company held approximately million of finance contracts that are expected to be fully liquidated in fiscal capital expenditures were  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
significant expenditures in these years included the expansion of existing distribution facilities to accommodate multiple business units  the expansion of our general office building and continuing investments in information systems

the company s existing debt facilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives  including acquisitions 
the company sells a significant portion of its finance contracts to a commercial paper funded conduit managed by a third party bank  and as a result  commercial paper is indirectly an important source of liquidity for the company 
the company is allowed to participate in the conduit due to the quality of its finance contracts and its financial strength 
cash flow could be impaired if the company s financial strength diminished to a level that precluded the company from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities

outlook over the last ten years  the company has been able to grow revenue and earnings through its strategy of emphasizing its value added  full service capabilities  using technology to enhance customer service  continuing to improve operating efficiencies  and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions 
while we believe that the weakness in the general economy that has existed during much of fiscal and will continue to affect our performance for at least several more quarters  the company s strategy will continue to focus on these key elements 
with strong operating cash flow and available credit capacity  the company is confident that it will be able to financially support its future growth 
the company believes that the strategic initiatives that it has implemented in the past several years  as well as those that will be implemented in fiscal and beyond  will strengthen the company s operational platform and contribute to future growth 
given these factors  the company considers itself well positioned to capitalize upon the growth opportunities in the dental supply  companion pet veterinary supply and the worldwide rehabilitation supply markets

foreign operations foreign sales are derived primarily from patterson dental and patterson medical operations in canada and from patterson medical s operations in the uk and france 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted earnings 
however  changes in exchange rates enhanced net sales in fiscal and  and adversely affected net sales in fiscal without foreign currency effects  net sales would have been million lower  million higher  and million lower in fiscal years  and  respectively 
changes in currency exchange rates are a risk accompanying foreign operations  but this risk is not considered material with respect to the consolidated operations of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has adopted various accounting policies to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management believes that the company s policies are conservative and its philosophy is to adopt accounting policies that minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments regarding the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities based on the information available to management at the time 
changes subsequent to the preparation of the financial statements in economic  technological and competitive conditions may materially impact the recorded values of the company s assets and liabilities 
therefore  the users of the financial statements should read all the notes to the consolidated financial statements and be aware that conditions currently unknown to management may develop in the future 
this may require a material adjustment to a recorded asset or liability to consistently apply the company s significant accounting principles and policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial performance and condition of the company may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that the company has not previously experienced and for which the company has not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle

cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for all inventories  except for foreign inventories and manufactured inventories  which are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company continually assesses the valuation of our inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to estimated realizable value 
estimates are made of the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other indefinite lived intangible assets include copyrights  trade names and trademarks 
goodwill for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step impairment test at the reporting unit level 
the company has three reporting units at april   which are the same as our operating units 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value  as determined by its discounted cash flows 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recorded 
the determination of fair value involves uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the company conducts impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
additionally  in assessing goodwill for impairment  we consider the reasonableness of the implied control premium based on market capitalizations and recent market transactions 
we assess other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of an asset with its fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the determination of fair value involves assumptions  including projected revenues and gross profit levels  as well as consideration of any factors that may indicate potential impairment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  management completed its annual goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests and determined there was no impairment 
although the company believes our estimates and assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such estimates and assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results  including an impairment charge that could be material 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 
the company s definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of an exclusive distribution agreement and customer lists 
when impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite the company s belief that its tax return positions are supportable  the company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
the company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made and could materially affect our financial results 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes would have increased decreased by percent of income before taxes  consolidated net income would have decreased increased million in fiscal valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets if  after assessment of available positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be fully realized 
stock based compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation based on certain assumptions including inputs within the black scholes model and estimated forfeitures 
these assumptions require subjective judgment and changes in the assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates 
management assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate forfeitures and to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation on a regular basis 
circumstances may change  and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination or estimates of forfeitures 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions  the amount of compensation expense associated with stock based compensation may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk consisting of foreign currency rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates 

table of contents the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in its operating statement due to transactions denominated primarily in canadian dollars  british pounds and euros 
although the company is not currently involved with foreign currency hedge contracts  it continually evaluates its foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms for use in managing such risk 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar in relation to the company s most significant foreign currency exposures would have reduced fiscal net sales by approximately million 
this amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impact of the currency exchange movements on cost of sales and operating expenses 
the company s earnings are also affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates through the investment of its cash balances  borrowings under libor based debt instruments and the practice of selling fixed rate equipment finance contracts under agreements with both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks that provide for pricing based on variable interest rates 
as of april   the company had a million variable rate term note outstanding 
the company views its variable interest rate debt position on a net basis that gives effect to the company s cash and short term investment balances 
when considering the exposure under the agreements whereby the company sells equipment finance contracts to both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks  the company has the ability to select pricing based on interest rates ranging from day libor up to twelve month libor 
in addition  the majority of the portfolio of finance contracts generally turns over in less than months and the company can adjust the rate it charges on new customer contracts at any time 
therefore  in times where the interest rate markets are not rapidly increasing or decreasing  the average interest rate in the portfolio generally moves with the interest rate markets and thus would parallel the underlying interest rate movement of the pricing built into the sale agreements 
in calculating the gain on the contract sales  the company uses an interest rate curve that approximates the maturity period of the then outstanding contracts 
if increases in the interest rate markets occur  the average interest rate in our contract portfolio may not increase at the same rate  resulting in a reduction of gain on the contracts sales as compared to the gain that would be realized if the average interest rate in our portfolio were to increase at a more similar rate to the interest rate markets 
the company estimates that if interest rates had been higher during the year  the annual impact would have been to reduce earnings before income tax by less than million
