we provide our products on an on demand basis through a web browser 
our email marketing customers pay a monthly subscription fee that generally ranges between per month and per month based on the size of their contact lists and  in some cases  volume of mailings 
our survey customers pay a flat monthly fee of that enables them to receive and track a maximum of  survey responses 
our event marketing customers pay a fee of per month to manage up to five concurrent events 
we offer discounts for multiple product purchases and prepayments and to non profits 
at december   we had  email marketing customers 
we measure our customer base as the number of email marketing customers that we bill directly in the last month of a period 
we market our products and acquire our customers through a variety of sources including online marketing through search engines and advertising on online networks and other websites  offline marketing through radio advertising  local seminars and other marketing efforts  contractual relationships with our channel partners  referrals from our growing customer base  general brand awareness and the inclusion of a link to our website in the footer of emails sent by our customers 
in  our cost of customer acquisition  which we define as our total sales and marketing expense divided by the gross number of email marketing customers added during the year  was approximately per email marketing customer  implying payback on a revenue basis in less than a year 
this implied payback is calculated by dividing the acquisition cost per email marketing customer by the average monthly total revenue per email marketing customer  which was in 
table of contents our on demand email marketing product was first offered commercially in in  our revenue was million and our net loss was million 
on october   we completed our initial public offering  in which we sold and issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we raised million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs 
on april   we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock  of which  shares were sold by us and  shares were sold by existing stockholders  at a price to the public of per share 
we raised million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs 
key financial and operating metrics in connection with the ongoing operation of our business  our management regularly reviews key financial and operating metrics including revenue  expenses  average monthly revenue growth  average revenue per email marketing customer  cost of acquisition  gross and net customer additions  trialer growth  conversion rates for our website visitors and our trialers  customer attrition  customer satisfaction rates  average speed of answer for customer support calls  email deliverability rates  and capital expenditures  among others 
management considers these financial and operating metrics critical to understanding and improving our business  reviewing our historical performance  benchmarking our performance versus other companies and identifying current and future trends  and for planning purposes 
in addition  we consider the following non gaap financial measures to be key indicators of our financial performance adjusted ebitda  which we define as gaap net income loss plus depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation and minus net interest income  adjusted ebitda margin  which we define as adjusted ebitda divided by revenue  and free cash flow  which we define as net cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of property and equipment 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations 
these non gaap financial measures  however  are not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and should not be considered a substitute for gaap financial measures  including but not limited to net income loss or cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
certain trends and uncertainties the following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties  which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
this summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties that could impact our business in the long or short term 
the summary should be considered along with the factors identified in the section titled risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this report 
we continue to closely monitor current adverse economic conditions  particularly as they impact small businesses  associations and non profits 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries  but the longer the duration the greater risks we face in operating our business 
we believe that given the size of our potential market and the relatively low barriers to entry  competition will continue to increase 
increased competition could result from existing competitors or new competitors that enter the market because of the potential opportunity 
we will continue to closely monitor competitive activity and respond accordingly 
increased competition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we believe that as we continue to grow revenue at expected rates  our cost of revenue and operating expenses  including sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
for a description of the general trends we anticipate in various expense categories  see cost of revenue and operating expenses below 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
during  we experienced a substantial decline in our investment income as a result of the reduction in interest rates generally 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue principally from subscription fees from our customers 
our revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying customers and the subscription fees for our products and is not concentrated within any one customer or group of customers 
in  our top email marketing customers accounted for less than of our total email marketing revenue 
we do not require our customers to commit to a contractual term  however  our customers are required to prepay for subscriptions on a monthly  semi annual  or annual basis by providing a credit card or check form of payment 
fees are recorded initially as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a daily basis over the prepaid subscription period 
we also generate a small amount of revenue from ancillary services related to our products  which primarily consist of professional services and training through our experts program 
revenue generated from professional services and training accounted for approximately of gross revenue for each of the years ended december   and cost of revenue and operating expenses we allocate certain occupancy and general office related expenses  such as rent  utilities  office supplies and depreciation of general office assets to cost of revenue and operating expense categories based on headcount 
as a result  an occupancy expense allocation is reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of wages and benefits for software operations and customer support personnel  credit card processing fees  and depreciation and amortization  maintenance and hosting of our software applications underlying our product offerings 
we allocate a portion of customer support costs relating to assisting trial customers to sales and marketing expense 
the expenses related to our hosted software applications are affected by the number of customers who subscribe to our products and the complexity and redundancy of our software applications and hosting infrastructure 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expect to increase our number of customers  but decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue due to efficiencies created by our expected revenue growth 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for product strategy and development personnel 
we have focused our research and development efforts on improving ease of use  functionality and technological scalability of our existing products as well as on developing new offerings 
we primarily expense research and development costs 
however  direct development costs related to software enhancements that add functionality are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life 
we expect that on an annual basis research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance and expand our product offerings  but remain generally consistent or decline slightly as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a similar rate 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional costs  wages and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  partner referral fees  and the portion of customer support costs that relate to assisting trial customers 
advertising costs consist primarily of pay per click advertising with search engines  other online and offline advertising media  including radio and print advertisements  as well as the costs to create and produce these advertisements 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
promotional costs consist primarily of public relations  memberships  and event costs 
our 
table of contents advertising and promotional expenses have historically been highest in the fourth quarter of each year as this reflects a period of increased sales and marketing activity for many small organizations 
in order to continue to grow our business and brand and category awareness  we expect that we will continue to commit substantial resources to our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we expect that on an annual basis sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for administrative  human resources  internal information technology support  finance and accounting personnel  professional fees  certain taxes and other corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel in connection with the anticipated growth of our business and incur costs related to operating as a public company 
therefore  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but remain generally consistent or decline slightly as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a similar rate 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
accordingly  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we provide access to our products through subscription arrangements whereby our customers are charged a fee for access to our products 
subscription arrangements include access to use our software via the internet and support services  such as telephone support 
when there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is deemed reasonably assured  we recognize revenue on a daily basis over the subscription period as the services are delivered 
delivery is considered to have occurred at the time the customer has paid for the products and has access to their account via a log in and password 
we also offer ancillary services to our customers related to our products such as professional services and training through our experts program 
professional services and training revenue is accounted for separately from subscription revenue as those services have value on a standalone basis  do not involve a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria and as the fair value of our subscription services is evidenced by their availability on a standalone basis 
professional services and training revenue is recognized as the services and training are performed 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of income taxes currently due plus deferred income taxes related to timing differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for financial statements and income tax reporting 
deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets is provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
software and website development costs 
relative to development costs of our on demand products and website  in accordance with authoritative guidance  we capitalize certain direct costs to develop functionality as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are probable to result in additional functionality 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized as part of property 
table of contents and equipment until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalized software is amortized over a three year period and the expense is reflected in the expense category to which the software relates 
redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant 
we accounted for the freestanding warrant to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock that was outstanding until its exercise in october as a liability that was recorded at fair value 
the fair value of the warrant was subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date prior to its exercise in october the changes in fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model were recognized as other expense 
stock based compensation 
we value all stock based compensation  including grants of stock options  at fair value on the date of grant  and expense the fair value over the applicable service period 
the straight line method is applied to all grants with service conditions  while the graded vesting method is applied to all grants with both service and performance conditions 
commencing in the fourth quarter  we based the fair value of common stock on the quoted market price of our stock 
because there was no public market for our common stock prior to the initial public offering  our board of directors determined the fair value of common stock for those earlier periods by taking into account our most recently available valuation of common stock 
the fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
because the company has a limited history of operating as a public company  the expected term assumption was based on the simplified method for estimating expected term for awards that qualify as plain vanilla options under authoritative guidance 
expected volatility was based on historical volatility of the publicly traded stock of a peer group of companies  inclusive of the company  commencing october the risk free interest rate was determined by reference to us treasury yields at or near the time of grant for time periods similar to the expected term of the award 
the relevant data used to determine the value of the stock option grants is as follows year ended december  weighted average risk free interest rate expected term in years weighted average expected volatility expected dividends these assumptions represented our best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
authoritative guidance requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
in developing a forfeiture rate estimate  we have considered our historical experience to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we have unrecognized compensation expense associated with outstanding stock options at december  of million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

we made additional capital expenditures in for equipment used in our product infrastructure 
we opened a second sales and support office in temporary space in july until our long term office space was ready for us to occupy in april we made capital expenditures in and to outfit both the temporary and long term space 
in  we signed a new lease for our corporate headquarters that extends our occupancy through september and increases the square footage throughout the duration of the lease 
we increased the amount of space we occupied in and expect to occupy additional space as it is made available to us 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million to million  which will consist primarily of hardware and software purchases  capitalization of internal use software  and furniture and leasehold improvements related to our additional office space 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  development of new products  market acceptance of our products  the levels of advertising and promotion required to launch additional products and improve our competitive position in the marketplace  the expansion of our sales  support and marketing organizations  the establishment of additional offices in the united states and worldwide and the building of infrastructure necessary to support our anticipated growth  the response of competitors to our products and our relationships with suppliers and clients

we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings to fund our operations  develop or enhance products  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if required  additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders or we may be subject to covenants that restrict how we conduct our business 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 

table of contents the markets in which we operate continue to suffer from the effects of the economic recession 
we have limited experience operating our business during an economic downturn 
we do not know if our current business model will operate as effectively during an economic downturn 
furthermore  we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries  but the longer the duration the greater risks we face in operating our business 
therefore  the current economic conditions could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and working capital 
during the last three years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business 
in light of the current economic recession  we are unable to predict whether inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing activities 
we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities 
new accounting guidance in september  the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance provides another alternative for establishing fair value for a deliverable 
when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price for separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
this guidance is effective january   and early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations in may  we signed a new noncancelable real estate operating lease that superseded the original lease for our headquarters 
the new lease incorporates both the space we were occupying under the original lease as well as additional space that will be made available to us through the term of the lease 
the new lease is effective through september in may  we entered into two lease agreements with two related lessors in connection with opening a second sales and support office 
the first agreement provided for temporary space and terminated in april the second agreement provides for long term space for a period that began in april and expires in april we have agreements with two vendors to provide specialized space and related services from which we host our software application 
the agreements include payment commitments that expire at various dates through as of december   we had issued both cancellable and non cancellable purchase orders to various vendors and entered into contractual commitments with various vendors totaling approximately million 
this amount relates primarily to marketing programs and other non marketing related goods and services to be delivered over the next twelve months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we bill for our products in us dollars and receive payment in us dollars and our operating expenses are paid predominantly in us dollars 
accordingly  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to material fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december   which consisted of cash  short term government securities  corporate and agency bonds  certificates of deposit and money market instruments 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  however  due to the short term nature of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates have significantly reduced our interest income in as compared to
