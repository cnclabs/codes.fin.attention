item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive overview we are a specialty retailer of private branded  sophisticated  casual to dressy clothing  intimates  complementary accessories  and other non clothing gift items operating under the chico s  white house black market  and soma intimates brand names 
we earn revenues and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our retail stores  on our various websites and through our call centers  which take orders for all brands 
results of initiatives for we outlined several goals that we believed would be vital to improving our performance improving the performance of the chico s brand investing in the growth potential of the wh bm and soma brands accelerating the investment in and growth of the direct to consumer dtc channel controlling expenses and rationalizing the expense structure improving inventory control our financial results were the direct result of executing on these goals and we saw improvements in key financial indicators for each brand as well as increased consolidated earnings 
chico s the successful performance of the chico s brand is primarily the result of distinctive merchandise offerings  an effective and fresh print and television marketing campaign  and the renewed focus on providing our customers with our trademarked most amazing personal service 
as a result  the chico s brand experienced significant improvement in sales and gross margin over the prior year 
wh bm the wh bm brand  which now encompasses approximately of total net sales  was also a key driver of our improved results in  generating double digit comparable store sales growth 
wh bm s results were largely attributable to providing our customer with the right fashion and high quality customer service 
in fact  wh bm total sales for totaled million  including stores and dtc  which is the highest level of annual sales ever achieved by the brand 
soma the soma brand delivered improved results in and we continue to believe in its growth potential 
during  we refocused the soma brand with a mission of providing innovative and expertly fitted intimate and lifestyle apparel  while offering designer quality at affordable prices 
direct to consumer our dtc channel experienced significant growth in as sales increased over last year 
we believe this improvement was attributable to enhanced functionality on our websites and improved online assortments 
expense structure the success of on going savings initiatives  particularly at the store level  and throughout the business in  coupled with the increase in comparable store sales  contributed to a significant decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales  compared to both before and after excluding the impairment and restructuring charges from both years 
inventory management another area of focus during was control over our inventory 
by successfully implementing a tight inventory management strategy  we decreased our markdowns  enabling more full price selling 
our inventory management initiative proved to be a significant contributing factor in the improved performance of all three brands during the year 

table of contents financial highlights for fiscal net sales increased to billion compared to billion in  and consolidated comparable store sales increased compared with a decrease of last year 
gross margin rate increased to from in  and operating income was million compared to an operating loss last year of million 
net income in was million compared to a net loss of million in  and earnings per diluted share was compared to a loss of last year 
net income for included million of pre tax non cash impairment charges compared to the net loss which included total impairment and restructuring pre tax charges of million 
net sales for the dtc channel increased in to million 
cash and marketable securities ended the year at million  an increase of over last year 
cash flows from operations were million compared with million in key performance indicators in order to monitor our success  we review certain key performance indicators  including comparable store sales growth in our comparable store sales sales from stores open for at least twelve full months  including stores that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market improved significantly  reversing two years of decreasing comparable store sales 
we believe that our ability to deliver consistent increases in comparable store sales will prove to be a key factor in determining our future levels of success 
positive operating cash flow and capital expenditures we believe consistent cash flow generation sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures is and will be a key indicator of our performance 
historically  a key strength of the business has been the ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations 
store productivity we consistently monitor various key performance indicators of store productivity including sales per square foot  store operating contribution margin and store cash flow in order to assess our performance 
inventory management we actively manage our inventories based on seasonal trends  store productivity results and anticipated sales volumes  which may lead to increased or decreased inventory levels 
we believe that constant monitoring of our inventories  on a per square foot basis assists us in planning future sales  determining markdowns and assessing our customers response to the merchandise 
future outlook for fiscal  we are currently forecasting a mid single digit increase in comparable store sales with modest improvement expected in our gross margin rate as a percentage of net sales 
although we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to reflect leverage based on the forecasted comparable store sales increase  we are anticipating additional marketing costs  particularly in the first half of fiscal  associated with television and print media campaigns  in the range of million to million 
in addition  we expect to expend an additional to million on paid search and other customer acquisition initiatives for the dtc operations 
our total capital expenditure plan for fiscal approximates million 
approximately million is allocated to new boutique stores and store related projects  which includes store refurbishments 
approximately million of the capital expenditure plan is directed to ongoing technology projects  including jda systems development and implementation 
the remainder of the capital expenditure plan is currently designated for dtc projects  our distribution centers  and our nssc 

table of contents results of operations net sales the following table depicts net sales by chico s soma stores  wh bm stores  dtc and other net sales in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal current period  fiscal prior period  and fiscal dollar amounts in thousands net sales fiscal fiscal fiscal chico s soma stores wh bm stores direct to consumer other net sales total net sales net sales by chico s  wh bm and soma stores increased from the prior period primarily due to positive comparable store sales for all three brands 
a summary of the factors impacting year over year sales increases is provided in the table below dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal comparable store sales increases decreases comparable store sales non comp store sales increases number of new stores opened  net does not include fitigues stores acquired in fiscal and closed in fiscal the consolidated comparable store sales increase of in fiscal was driven primarily by an approximate increase in the chico s average unit retail price  which was partially offset by a slight decrease in units per transaction at chico s front line stores 
comparable store sales results also benefited from an increase in both the average unit retail price as well as total transactions at the wh bm brand compared to the like period last year 
the chico s soma brands comparable store sales  increased by approximately and the wh bm brand s comparable store sales increased by approximately compared to the prior period 
the comparable store sales decrease of in fiscal was driven partially by a decrease of in the chico s average unit retail price  as well as from a decrease in the chico s and wh bm average number of transactions per store  offset in part by an increase in the wh bm average unit retail price of 
in fiscal  wh bm same store sales represented approximately of the total same store sales base compared to in fiscal the chico s soma brands comparable store sales  decreased by approximately and the wh bm brand same store sales decreased by approximately when comparing fiscal to fiscal net sales by dtc for fiscal increased by million  or  compared to fiscal due to enhanced functionality on our websites and improved online assortments 
we targeted the dtc channel for growth in fiscal and we continue to believe there is room for further expansion 
in fiscal  net sales by dtc decreased by million  or  compared to fiscal this overall decrease was attributable to lower sales of chico s brand merchandise 
in contrast  dtc sales for the wh bm and soma brands increased in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents cost of goods sold gross margin the following table depicts cost of goods sold and gross margin in dollars and the related gross margin percentages for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal cost of goods sold gross margin gross margin percentage gross margin percentage increased by basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal the gross margin increase was attributable to significant improvements in the merchandise margins at both the chico s and wh bm brands 
both brands benefited from substantially lower markdowns and  to a lesser extent  higher initial markups 
these improvements in gross margin were slightly offset by continued investment in merchandise and product development including technology initiatives 
in fiscal  gross margin percentage decreased by basis points compared to fiscal resulting primarily from a decrease of approximately basis points in the chico s brand merchandise margins in compared to s margins  which was attributable to lower initial markups and higher markdowns considered necessary in order to liquidate inventory and bring inventory levels more in line with sales trends 
the gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by continued investment in product development and merchandising functions  coupled with the deleverage of these costs arising as a result of the negative comparable store sales 
the overall decrease in gross margin was further exacerbated by a basis point decline in the brand merchandise margins at wh bm  which decrease was also due primarily to lower initial markups and higher markdowns considered necessary in order to liquidate inventory and bring inventory levels more in line with sales trends  which resulted in overall gross margins deteriorating exacerbated by the impact of the mix effect resulting from wh bm sales constituting a larger portion of the overall net sales 
store operating expenses the following table depicts store operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal store operating expenses percentage of total net sales store operating expenses include direct expenses  and reflect such items as personnel  occupancy  depreciation and supplies  incurred to operate each of our stores and the dtc channel 
in addition  store operating expenses include support expenditures for district and regional management expenses and other store support functions 
store operating expenses increased slightly in dollars due to higher occupancy costs but as a percentage of net sales decreased by basis points due to the leverage from positive comparable store sales as well as effective implementation of on going cost savings initiatives at the store level 
store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to increased occupancy costs at the store level and increased personnel costs as a percentage of net sales  as selling payroll did not flex in direct proportion to the decrease in comparable store sales 
the increase was also impacted by the deleverage associated with the overall negative comparable store sales 

table of contents marketing the following table depicts marketing expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal marketing percentage of total net sales marketing expenses include national marketing programs such as direct marketing efforts  national advertising expenses and related support costs 
marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal mainly due to the leverage from positive comparable store sales 
in addition  marketing expenses in dollars decreased due to savings in direct mailing costs attributable to both decreased materials costs and circulations  partially offset by an increase in broadcast and print advertisement 
marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal due to cost reduction initiatives and increased direct mail efficiencies 
national store support center the following table depicts nssc expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal nssc percentage of total net sales nssc expenses consist of the corporate level functions including executive management  human resources  management information systems and finance  among others 
nssc expenses increased slightly in dollars mainly due to increased incentive compensation costs  offset by back office cost reduction initiatives 
however  as a percentage of net sales  nssc decreased by basis points due to the leverage associated with the positive comparable store sales 
nssc expenses decreased in dollars when comparing fiscal to fiscal  mainly due to the cost reduction initiatives and increased efficiencies yet remained flat as a percentage of net sales as a result of the overall negative comparable store sales 
impairment and restructuring charges the following table depicts impairment and restructuring charges in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal impairment and restructuring charges percentage of total net sales the impairment charges recognized in fiscal include non cash impairment charges incurred in the first  second and fourth quarters of the year 
during the first quarter of fiscal  an impairment charge totaling million was recorded related to the write off of development costs for software applications 
during the second quarter of fiscal  a non cash charge totaling million was incurred related to the partial write off of a note receivable and million in non cash impairment charges related to the write off of fixed assets at certain underperforming stores 
during the fourth quarter  an additional non cash impairment charge of million was taken on the aforementioned note receivable based on a further evaluation of the underlying collateral 
the impairment and restructuring charges recognized in fiscal consisted of non cash impairment charges totaling million  related to the write off of fixed assets at certain underperforming stores  and severance and workforce reduction costs totaling million  related to the elimination of approximately of the nssc employee base and charges related to the separation agreement with our former ceo 
virtually all payments related to the severance and workforce reduction action were completed in fiscal 
table of contents gain on sale of investment on july   vf corporation announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire lucy activewear  inc 
lucy  a privately held retailer of women s activewear apparel  in which we held a cost method investment 
the transaction was completed during the third quarter of fiscal and we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million  which is reflected as non operating income in the accompanying statement of operations 
interest income  net the following table depicts interest income  net in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal interest income  net percentage of total net sales in fiscal  interest income  net  decreased in total dollars and as a percentage of net sales compared to fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments and  to a lesser extent  due to the non accrual of interest income in fiscal on our note receivable which interest amount was deemed uncollectable 
in fiscal  interest income  net  decreased in total dollars and as a percentage of net sales compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the average invested balance of marketable securities  year over year as well as lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain state tax examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation relating to certain state tax accruals 
the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to permanent differences  mainly charitable inventory contributions and tax free interest  offset in part by the impact of a decrease in deferred compensation plan assets which  as a net amount  represented a considerably higher portion of pre tax loss in fiscal compared to pre tax income in fiscal liquidity and capital resources overview our ongoing capital requirements have been and are for funding capital expenditures for the continued improvement in information technology tools  for new  expanded  relocated and remodeled stores  for our distribution centers and other central support facilities  and for the planned expansion of our nssc campus 
the following table depicts our capital resources at the end of fiscal year and amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal cash and cash equivalents marketable securities working capital working capital increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to an increase in cash and marketable securities resulting from higher cash flow from operations and lower capital expenditures during fiscal  offset in part by the reclassification of the note receivable held by us from a current asset to a long term asset 
the significant components of working capital are cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  receivables and inventories  reduced by accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy working capital needs  future capital expenditures see 
table of contents new store openings and infrastructure investments  commitments  dividend payments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next months 
furthermore  while it is our intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend for fiscal and beyond  any determination to pay future dividends will be made by the board of directors and will depend on future earnings  financial condition and other factors 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  which was an increase of approximately million from fiscal  and resulted primarily from higher net income and increases in accounts payable 
in fiscal  cash from operating activities was million  and was due primarily to non cash adjustments which served to offset the net loss from operations 
these adjustments included depreciation and amortization expense  deferred tax benefits  stock based compensation  and an impairment of long lived assets  as well as changes in accounts receivables  payables and inventory 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
we had net purchases of million of marketable securities in the current year 
by contrast  in the prior period  we had net proceeds of million in marketable securities 
our approximate million decreased investment in capital expenditures when compared to the prior year was primarily related to significantly lower costs associated with new  relocated  remodeled and expanded chico s soma and wh bm stores  as well as a decrease in other miscellaneous capital expenditures including costs associated with our nssc s improvements 
however  the decrease was offset by increases in system upgrades and new software implementations and the expansion of our distribution centers 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal during both fiscal and  we received proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee participation in our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  cash paid for deferred financing costs  related to our credit facility  was million 
during fiscal  and  we repurchased   and  shares  respectively  of restricted stock in connection with employee tax withholding obligations under employee compensation plans  which are not purchases under any publicly announced plan 
new store openings and infrastructure investments we expect our overall square footage in fiscal to increase approximately  reflecting approximately net openings of chico s stores  net openings of wh bm stores  approximately net openings of soma stores and relocations expansions in fiscal  which does not include soma sister stores 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions require or as opportunities arise 
during  we acquired property in close proximity to our existing distribution center in winder  georgia comprising acres of land with an approximate  square foot building for approximately million 
we believe that the liquidity needed for new stores including the continued investment associated with the soma brand  our continuing store remodel expansion program  the investments required for our nssc and distribution centers  our continued installation and upgrading of new and existing software packages  and investment in inventory levels associated with this growth will be funded primarily from cash flow from operations and our existing cash and marketable securities balances  and  if necessary  the capacity included in our bank credit facility 

table of contents in fiscal  we completed the first major phase of our multi year  planned implementation of the new erp system by converting soma to the new merchandising system as well as rolling out the new financial systems at the same time 
the second major phase was completed in early and we are currently utilizing this system in all of our brands 
the third major phase includes on going enhancements and optimization of the new erp across all three brands  as well as the deployment of additional functionality across various other functions 
also  during fiscal  we purchased jda enterprise planning  jda assortment planning and jda allocation software applications instead of previously planned implementations of related sap applications and revised our roll out plan accordingly 
we completed the implementation of the allocation functionality during fiscal and plan to complete a substantial portion of the remaining jda applications in fiscal given our existing cash and marketable securities balances and the capacity included in our bank credit facility  we do not believe that we will need to seek other sources of financing to conduct our operations  pay future dividends or pursue our expansion plans even if cash flow from operations should prove to be less than anticipated or if there should arise a need for additional letter of credit capacity due to establishing new and expanded sources of supply  or if we were to increase the number of new stores planned to be opened in future periods 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january  amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments total as of january   our contractual obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under operating leases and non cancelable purchase commitments 
amounts due under non cancelable purchase commitments consists of amounts to be paid under agreements to purchase inventory that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the relevant taxing authorities  we are unable to estimate a final determination related to our uncertain tax positions and therefore  we have excluded the uncertain tax positions  totaling million at january  from the above table 
on november   we entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility the credit facility with suntrust bank  as administrative agent and lender and suntrust robinson humphrey  inc as lead arranger 
the credit facility provides a million revolving credit facility that matures on november  the credit facility provides for swing advances of up to million and issuance of letters of credit up to million 
the credit facility also contains a feature that provides us the ability  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  to increase the commitments available under the credit facility from million up to million through additional syndication 
the proceeds of any borrowings under the credit facility may be used to fund future permitted acquisitions  to provide for working capital and for other general corporate purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements at january  and january   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and believes the following assumptions and estimates are significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 
inventory valuation and shrinkage we identify potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with our overall growth rate 
excess quantities of inventory are identified through evaluation of inventory aging  review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences  as well as specific identification based on fashion trends 
further  exposure to inadequate realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in current business trends 
we provide lower of cost or market adjustments for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
historically  the variation of those estimates to observed results has been insignificant and  although possible  significant variation is not expected in the future 
if  however  our markdown rate and cost percentage estimates varied by of their values  the carrying amount of inventory would have changed by million 
we estimate our expected shrinkage of inventories between our physical inventory counts by applying the most recent average shrinkage experience 
these rates are updated to reflect the most recent physical inventory shrinkage experience 
historically  the variation of those estimates to observed results has been insignificant and  although possible  significant variation is not expected in the future 
if  however  our estimated shrinkage percentages varied by  we would have incurred approximately million in additional expense and the carrying amount of inventory would have changed by million 
revenue recognition although our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy 
retail sales at our stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns  sales discounts under the passport club and the black book loyalty programs and company issued coupons 
we record dtc revenue based on the estimated receipt date of the product to our customers 
under our current program  gift cards do not have expiration dates 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time the gift card is sold 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized for gift cards upon redemption 
in addition  we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards based on determining that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions commonly referred to as gift card breakage 
we recognize gift card breakage under the redemptive recognition method 
this method records gift card breakage as revenue on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on our historical gift card breakage rate 
we determine the gift card breakage rate based on our historical redemption patterns 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns related to store and dtc sales 
to account for the financial impact of this process  we estimate future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels and projected future return levels 

table of contents evaluation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount  an asset is determined to be impaired  and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of an asset is estimated using estimated future cash flows of the asset discounted by a rate commensurate with the risk involved with such asset while incorporating marketplace assumptions 
the estimate of future cash flows requires management to make certain assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and the useful lives of the assets 
we exercise our best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding our business when applying these impairment rules 
we establish our assumptions and arrive at the estimates used in these calculations based upon our historical experience  knowledge of the retail industry and by incorporating third party data  which we believe results in a reasonably accurate approximation of fair value 
nevertheless  changes in the assumptions used could have an impact on our assessment of recoverability 
for example  as it relates to the million write off of fixed assets for certain underperforming stores in fiscal  if we had decreased our forecast of future sales by throughout the forecast period or increased our discount rate by  our write off would have increased by approximately million 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying amounts  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
there are several significant assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model 
included among these are the estimates used to forecast cash flows over a year forecast period  including an estimate for overall sales growth based on assumptions with respect to future comparable store sales growth  changes in store counts and square footage growth rates 
we also estimate future gross margin and operating margin percentages 
the discount rate is estimated based on an approximation of our weighted average cost of capital formulated by reviewing assumptions used by marketplace participants  in order to calculate the present value of forecasted future cash flows 
lastly  our discounted cash flow model estimates future cash flows where appropriate beyond the year forecast period for purposes of the present value computation by applying a long term growth rate commensurate with an estimate of overall us economic growth 
with regard to the goodwill impairment test completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  if we were to have assumed a weighted average cost of capital higher than the rate actually used in the goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the chico s and wh bm reporting units would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
nevertheless  even such reduced fair value amounts still would be greater than the respective carrying values of the respective reporting units and thus the second step of the goodwill impairment test still would not have been triggered 
conversely  if we had assumed a sales growth estimate lower throughout the forecast period than the rate used in our goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the chico s and wh bm reporting units would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
again  however  even such reduced fair value amounts still would be greater than the respective carrying values of the respective reporting units and thus the second step of the goodwill impairment test still would not have been triggered 
currently  we believe that neither of our reporting units is at risk of failing the first step of goodwill impairment testing 
we evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
for example  with regards to our annual impairment test of the wh bm trademark intangible asset  if we had assumed a sales growth estimate lower throughout the forecast period than the rate used in its trademark impairment test  the fair value of the wh bm trademark would have decreased by approximately million 
conversely  an increase of in the discount rate would have decreased the fair value by approximately million 
in either case  the fair value of the wh bm trademark still would be greater than its carrying value and no impairment charge would have been recognized 

table of contents operating leases rent expense under store operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
landlord incentives  rent free periods  rent escalation clauses and other rental expenses are also amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  which includes the construction period and which is generally days prior to the store opening date when we generally begin improvements in preparation for our intended use 
tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit within deferred liabilities and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease  which includes the construction period and one renewal when there is a significant economic penalty associated with non renewal 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and published guidance as applicable to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets  since management anticipates that the full amount of these assets should be realized in the future 
our effective tax rate considers management s judgment of expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
due to the substantial amounts involved and judgment necessary  we deem this policy could be critical to our financial statements 
we record amounts for uncertain tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
consequently  changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized related to income tax uncertainties and may affect our results of operations or financial position 
historically  the variation of those estimates to observed results has been insignificant and  although possible  significant variation is not expected in the future 
we believe our assumptions for estimates continue to be reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of such tax positions 
at january  and january   we had approximately million and million reserved for uncertain tax positions  respectively 
a difference in the ultimate settlement amount of our uncertain tax positions versus our tax reserves recorded on january  would have affected net income and the related reserves by approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted new accounting provisions regarding stock based compensation  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized during fiscal  and for share based awards includes a compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value and b compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
the calculation of stock based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgments 
these estimates include the fair value of each of the stock option awards granted  which is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under our stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
however  a change of in the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term used to calculate the 
table of contents fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal year ended january  would have affected net income by less than million for fiscal in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
in determining the portion of the stock based payment award that is ultimately expected to be earned  we derive forfeiture rates based on historical data 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance  we revise our forfeiture rates  when necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated 
as a result  in the event that a grant s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate at the completion of the vesting period  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we record in the current and prior periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu which amends accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measures and disclosures 
asu amends the asc to require disclosure of transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements  and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december   except for requirements related to level disclosures  which are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect that adoption of asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation our operations are influenced by general economic conditions 
historically  inflation has not had a material effect on the results of operations 
quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly depending on a number of factors including timing of new store openings  adverse weather conditions  the spring and fall fashion lines and shifts in the timing of certain holidays 
in addition  our periodic results can be directly and significantly impacted by the extent to which new merchandise offerings are accepted by customers and by the timing of the introduction of such merchandise 
certain factors that may affect future results this form k may contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which reflect our current views with respect to certain events that could have an effect on our future financial performance  including but without limitation  statements regarding future growth rates of our store concepts 
the statements may address items such as future sales  gross margin expectations  operating margin expectations  earnings per share expectations  planned store openings  closings and expansions  future comparable store sales  future product sourcing plans  inventory levels  planned marketing expenditures  planned capital expenditures and future cash needs 
in addition  from time to time  we may issue press releases and other written communications  and our representatives may make oral statements  which contain forward looking information 
these statements  including those in this form k and those in press releases or made orally  may include the words expects  believes  and similar expressions 
except for historical information  matters discussed in such oral and written statements  including this form k  are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those currently anticipated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk of our financial instruments as of january  has not significantly changed since january  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on any future indebtedness and our marketable securities 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to our revolving line of credit with our bank  however  as of january   we did not have any outstanding borrowings on our line of credit and  given our current liquidity position  do not expect to utilize our line of credit in the foreseeable future except for the continuing use of the letter of credit facility portion thereof 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which identifies allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
our investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities  including variable rate demand notes  which are considered highly liquid  variable rate municipal debt securities  municipal bonds  asset backed securities  corporate bonds  and us treasury securities 
although the variable rate demand notes  totaling million  have long term nominal maturity dates ranging from to  the interest rates generally reset weekly 
despite the long term nature of the underlying securities of the variable rate demand notes  we have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities 
the remainder of the portfolio  as of january  consisted of million of securities with maturity dates less than one year and million with maturity dates over one year and less than or equal to two years 
we consider all available for sale securities  including those with maturity dates beyond months  as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classify these securities as short term investments within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of january   an increase of basis points in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates would increase the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million
