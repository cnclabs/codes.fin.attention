item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general new york mortgage trust  inc  together with its consolidated subsidiaries nymt  the company  we  our  and us  is a self advised real estate investment trust  or reit  in the business of acquiring and managing primarily residential adjustable rate  hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities rmbs  for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a us government agency  such as the government national mortgage association ginnie mae or a us government sponsored entity gse or agency  such as the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  which we refer to collectively as agency rmbs  rmbs backed by prime jumbo and alternative a paper alt a mortgage loans non agency rmbs  and prime credit quality residential adjustable rate mortgage arm loans held in securitization trusts  or prime arm loans 
the remainder of our current investment portfolio is comprised of notes issued by a collateralized loan obligation clo 
we also may opportunistically acquire and manage various other types of real estate related and financial assets  including  among other things  certain non rated residential mortgage assets  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs  commercial real estate loans and other similar investments 
these assets  together with non agency rmbs and clos  typically present greater credit risk and less interest rate risk than our investments in agency rmbs and prime arm loans  and may also permit us to potentially utilize all or part of a significant net operating loss carry forward held by hypotheca capital  llc hc  then doing business as the new york mortgage company llc  our wholly owned subsidiary and former mortgage lending business 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders resulting from the spread between the interest and other income we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense we pay on the borrowings that we use to finance our leveraged assets and our operating costs  which we refer to as our net interest income 
we intend to achieve this objective by investing in a broad class of real estate related and financial assets  including those listed above  that in aggregate  will generate attractive risk adjusted total returns for our stockholders 
prior to  our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of agency rmbs  prime arm loans held in securitization trusts and certain non agency rmbs rated in the highest rating category by two rating agencies 
the prime arm loans in our portfolio were purchased from third parties or originated by us through hc and were subsequently securitized by us and are held in our four securitization trusts 
beginning in the first quarter of  we commenced a repositioning of our investment portfolio to transition the portfolio from one primarily focused on leveraged agency rmbs and prime arm loans held in securitization trusts  which primarily involve interest rate risk  to a more diversified portfolio that includes elements of credit risk with reduced leverage 
the repositioning included a reduction in the agency rmbs held in our portfolio through the disposition of million of gse issued collateralized mortgage obligation floating rate securities  which we refer to as agency cmo floaters  a net increase of approximately million par value in our non agency rmbs position and our opportunistic purchase in march of discounted notes issued by a clo 
we elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended on december  as a result  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders 
factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition our results of operations and financial condition are affected by various factors  including  among other things changes in interest rates  rates of prepayment  default and recovery on our assets or the mortgages or loans that underlie such assets  general economic and financial and credit market conditions  our leverage  our access to funding and our borrowing costs  our hedging activities  changes in the credit ratings of the loans  securities  and other assets we own  the market value of our investments  liabilities related to our discontinued operation  including repurchase obligations on the sales of mortgage loans  and requirements to maintain reit status and to qualify for an exemption from registration under the investment company act 
we earn income and generate cash through our investments 
our income is generated primarily from the net spread  which we refer to as net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our investment portfolio and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities and other operating costs 
our net interest income will vary based upon  among other things  the difference between the interest rates earned on our interest earning assets and the borrowing costs of the liabilities used to finance those investments  prepayment speeds and default and recovery rates on the assets or the loans underlying such assets 
because changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks effectively while maintaining our status as a reit 
we anticipate that  for any period during which changes in the interest rates earned on our assets do not coincide with interest rate changes on our borrowings  such assets will reprice more slowly than the corresponding liabilities 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may significantly influence our net interest income 
with the maturities of our assets generally of longer duration than those of our liabilities  interest rate increases will tend to decrease the net interest income we derive from  and the market value of our interest rate sensitive assets and therefore our book value  including agency rmbs  prime arm loans and certain non agency rmbs 
such rate increases could possibly result in operating losses or adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the yield on our assets may be affected by a difference between the actual prepayment rates and our projections 
prepayment rates  as reflected by the rate of principal paydown  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the economy and financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
to the extent we have acquired assets at a premium or discount to par  or face value  changes in prepayment rates may impact our anticipated yield 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments on our mortgage related assets will likely increase 
if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of such prepayments at comparable yields  our net interest income will be negatively impacted 
the current climate of government intervention in the mortgage markets significantly increases the risk associated with prepayments 
while we historically have used  and intend to use in the future  hedging to mitigate some of our interest rate risk  we do not hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates and prepayment rates  as there are practical limitations on our ability to insulate our portfolio from all potential negative consequences associated with changes in short term interest rates in a manner that will allow us to seek attractive net spreads on our assets 
in addition  our returns will be affected by the credit performance of our non agency rmbs and other investments 
our non agency rmbs and clo investments expose us to credit risk  however  the credit support built into non agency rmbs deal structures is designed to provide a level of protection against potential credit losses 
in addition  the discounted purchase prices paid for the non agency rmbs and clo investments in our portfolio provide further insulation from credit losses in the event  as we expect  that we receive less than of par value on such assets 
nevertheless  if credit losses on our investments  loans  or the loans underlying our investments exceed our expectations  it may have an adverse effect on our performance and our earnings 
as it relates to loans sold previously under certain loan sale agreements by our discontinued mortgage lending business  we may be required to repurchase some of those loans or indemnify the loan purchaser for damages caused by a breach of the loan sale agreement 
while in the past we complied with the repurchase demands by repurchasing the loan with cash and reselling it at a loss  thus reducing our cash position 
more recently  we have addressed these requests by negotiating a net cash settlement based on the actual or assumed loss on the loan in lieu of repurchasing the loans 
as of december   the amount of repurchase requests outstanding was approximately million  against which we had a reserve of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in settling the remaining repurchase demands on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to continue to resolve our current repurchase demands through negotiated net cash settlements  our liquidity could be adversely affected

risk factors above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
current market conditions and known material trends in recent years  the residential housing and mortgage and credit and financial markets in the united states and globally have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions  including loan defaults  credit losses and decreased liquidity 
these conditions  together with liquidating sales by several large institutions  have resulted in volatility in the value of most real estate related and financial assets  including many of the assets in our portfolio  and reduced available financing for certain assets 
in response to these conditions  the us government  federal reserve  us treasury  fdic and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions in an effort to stabilize the credit and financial markets and stimulate the economy 
these actions include  among other things  the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac  eesa  tarp  the cpp  talf  arra and the homeowner affordability and stability plan  or hasp 
although the impact from many of these actions remains uncertain  certain sectors have reported signs of stabilizing recently  including the agency rmbs market 
developments at fannie mae and freddie mac 
payments on the agency rmbs in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac 
because of the guarantee and the underwriting standards associated with mortgages underlying agency rmbs  they have historically had high price stability and been considered to present low credit risk 
however  the recent turmoil in the residential mortgage sector severely weakened the financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac 
as a result  agency rmbs experienced increased price volatility 
in response to the severely weakened financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac and the corresponding impact that this weakened condition was having on the us mortgage  credit and financial markets  in the us government placed fannie mae and freddie mac under federal conservatorship 
in connection with the placement of fannie mae and freddie mac in conservatorship  the us treasury agreed to provide certain financial support to these entities  including a larger scale agency rmbs purchasing program that is scheduled to terminate during the first quarter 
we expect that the us government s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac will allow these institutions to continue to issue agency rmbs 
however  no assurance can be given that the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to have a positive effect on the supply of agency rmbs 
for example  at a hearing on january   the chairman of the house financial services committee stated that the committee will be recommending to the us congress to abolish fannie mae and freddie mac in favor of a new system of providing housing finance 
prior to december  the financing arrangement between the us treasury and fannie mae and freddie mac required these entities to cap their agency rmbs portfolio at billion each and then begin reducing their portfolio of agency rmbs by per year beginning in in december  the us treasury loosened this requirement by allowing the portfolio reduction requirements to be applied to the maximum allowable size of the portfolios  rather than the actual size of the portfolios 
also  the us treasury originally was going to require fannie mae and freddie mac to pay a quarterly commitment fee to the us treasury beginning on march  the us treasury subsequently postponed that start date to december  the change to fannie mae and freddie macs portfolio reduction requirements could extend the time period by which these entities sell portions of their agency rmbs portfolios in the market  which  in turn  could cause the supply of agency rmbs to be smaller than we originally anticipated 
more recently  in february of this year  fannie mae and freddie mac announced that the gses will be purchasing delinquent loans from mortgage pools guaranteed by them 
delinquent loans for this program will be those that are days or greater delinquent as of measurement date 
freddie mac stated that it will be consummating all of its purchases at once  based on the delinquencies as of february  with payments to securities holders on march th and april th 
on march   fannie mae reported that it would buy approximately billion of loans out of guaranteed rmbs pools beginning in march and running through about june of this year 
these actions could decrease the net income derived from our agency rmbs 
mortgage asset values 
during  the market value of the agency rmbs in our portfolio was positively impacted by the federal reserve s program to purchase trillion of agency mbs 
this purchase program implemented by the federal reserve increased market prices of agency rmbs during  thereby reducing their market yield 
as a result  we did not acquire any agency rmbs during  and instead opportunistically disposed of the agency cmo floaters in our portfolio 
the federal reserve has indicated it will complete its planned purchases of agency rmbs by the end of the first quarter 
if no further action is taken by the federal reserve  the market value of agency rmbs may decline  which among other things  could cause the market value of our agency rmbs to decline 
market demand for non agency rmbs increased over the course of due to increased demand and the reduced market yields for agency rmbs 
accordingly  while non agency rmbs remain available at a discount  such discounts have narrowed relative to discounts available in early and late and may continue to narrow in the future  reducing the market yields on these assets 
nevertheless  we believe that despite higher market prices and lower yields  that risk adjusted returns on non agency rmbs continue to represent attractive investment opportunities 
credit quality 
the deterioration of the us housing market as well as the recent economic downturn have caused us residential mortgage delinquency rates to remain at high levels for various types of mortgage loans 
recent months have seen some stabilization or improvement of certain measures of credit quality  although this stabilization and or improvement may ultimately prove to be temporary financing markets and liquidity 
actions by the federal reserve and the us treasury over the past two years appear to have stabilized the financing and liquidity environment for agency rmbs 
the liquidity facilities created by the federal reserve during and and its lowering of the federal funds target rate to  along with the reduction of the day libor to as of december   have lowered our financing costs which most closely correlates with the day libor and stabilized the availability of repurchase agreement financing for agency rmbs 
moreover  collateral requirements improved throughout however  available leverage for non agency rmbs and other financial assets has remained scarce during due to the recent conditions in the housing and credit markets 
more recently  some investment banks have  to a limited extent  begun making term financing available for non agency rmbs 
as of the date of this report  our investment in agency rmbs and a clo remained unlevered  however  should the prospects for stable  reliable and favorable repurchase agreement financing for non agency rmbs develop in the future  we would expect to increase our repurchase agreement borrowings collateralized by non agency rmbs 
in addition to a stabilizing financing environment for agency rmbs  collateral requirements improved throughout with respect to interest rates  because of continued uncertainty in the credit markets and difficult us economic conditions  we expect that interest rates are likely to remain at these historically low levels until such time as the economic data begin to confirm a sustainable improvement in the overall economy 
prepayment rates 
as a result of various government initiatives  including hasp and the reduction in intermediate and longer term treasury yields  rates on conforming mortgages have declined  nearing historical lows during hybrid and adjustable rate mortgage originations have declined substantially  as rates on these types of mortgages are comparable with rates available on year fixed rate mortgages 
we experienced similar prepayment rates on both our agency rmbs and prime arm loans during the second  third and fourth quarters of we expect speeds to be higher in the first half of due to the announced delinquent loan buyback program from fannie mae 
we do not expect this will have a material impact on the company 
note regarding discontinued operation in connection with the sale of our wholesale and retail mortgage lending platform assets in the first quarter of  during the fourth quarter of  we classified our mortgage lending business as a discontinued operation 
as a result  we have reported revenues and expenses related to the mortgage lending business as a discontinued operation and the related assets and liabilities as assets and liabilities related to a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain assets  such as the deferred tax asset  and certain liabilities  such as subordinated debt and liabilities related to leased facilities not assigned are part of our ongoing operations and accordingly  we have not classified as a discontinued operation 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
until march   our discontinued mortgage lending operation contributed to our then current period financial results 
subsequent to march   our discontinued mortgage lending operation has impacted our financial results due to liabilities remaining after the sale of the operation s assets 
as of december  discontinued operations consist of million in assets and million in liabilities  down from million in assets and million in liabilities at december  prior to march   we originated a wide range of residential mortgage loan products including prime  alternative a  and to a lesser extent sub prime loans  home equity lines of credit  second mortgages  and bridge loans

conversely  if prepayment expectations decrease  the premium would be amortized over a longer period resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
we monitor our prepayment experience on a monthly basis and adjust the amortization rate to reflect current market conditions 
mortgage loans held in securitization trusts 
included in our portfolio are arm loans that we originated or purchased in bulk from third parties that met our investment criteria and portfolio requirements and that we subsequently securitized 
the company has completed four securitizations  three were classified as financings and one  new york mortgage trust  qualified as a sale  which resulted in the recording of residual assets and mortgage servicing rights 
the company sold all the residual assets related to the securitization during the third quarter ended september  incurring a realized loss of approximately  at december   mortgage loans held in securitization trusts totaled approximately million  or of our total assets 
of the mortgage loans held in securitized trusts  are traditional arms or hybrid arms  of which are arm loans that are interest only 
on our hybrid arms  interest rate reset periods are predominately five years or less and the interest only period is typically years  which mitigates the payment shock at the time of interest rate reset

the number of delinquent loans in our securitization trusts was significantly higher as of december  as compared to delinquencies as of december  the increase was due  in part  to higher delinquency rates nationally  which equaled approximately of all loans outstanding as of the end of the fourth quarter  and also as a result of the services of our loans treating as delinquent certain of the loans in our portfolio that are subject to  temporary modification plans

million of our subordinated debentures have a floating interest rate equal to three month libor plus  resetting quarterly  at december  
these securities mature on march  and may be called at par by us any time after march  hc entered into an interest rate cap agreement to limit the maximum interest rate cost of these trust preferred securities to through march  the term of the interest rate cap agreement is five years and resets quarterly in conjunction with the reset periods of the trust preferred securities and is schedule to mature in march million of our subordinated debentures have a fixed interest rate equal to up to and including july   at which point the interest rate is converted to a floating rate equal to one month libor plus until maturity

the series a preferred stock is convertible into shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of per share of common stock  which represents a conversion rate of two and one half shares of common stock for each share of series a preferred stock 
any shares of series a preferred stock that remain outstanding on december  must be redeemed in exchange for the liquidation amount  which is million plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
because of this mandatory redemption feature  we classify these securities as a liability on our balance sheet 
derivative assets and liabilities 
we generally hedge the risk related to changes in the benchmark interest rate used in the variable rate index  usually a london interbank offered rate libor 
in order to reduce these risks  we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive floating rate payments in exchange for fixed rate payments  effectively converting our short term repurchase agreement borrowing or cdos to a fixed rate 
we also enter into interest rate cap agreements whereby  in exchange for a fee  we are reimbursed for interest paid in excess of a contractually specified capped rate 
derivative financial instruments contain credit risk to the extent that the institutional counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with good credit ratings 
in addition  we regularly monitor the potential risk of loss with any one party resulting from this type of credit risk 
accordingly  we do not expect any material losses as a result of default by other parties  but can not guaranty we do not have counterparty failures 
we enter into derivative transactions solely for risk management purposes 
the decision of whether or not a given transaction  or a portion thereof  is hedged is made on a case by case basis  based on the risks involved and other factors as determined by senior management  including the financial impact on income and asset valuation and the restrictions imposed on reit hedging activities by the internal revenue code  among others 
in determining whether to hedge a risk  we may consider whether other assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions already offset or reduce the risk 
all transactions undertaken as a hedge are entered into with a view towards minimizing the potential for economic losses that could be incurred by us 
generally  all derivatives entered into are intended to qualify as cash flow hedges 
to this end  terms of the hedges are matched closely to the terms of hedged items

statement of operations analysis the following is a brief description of key terms from our statements of operations revenues 
our primary source of income is net interest income on our portfolio of assets 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our assets  and interest expense  which is the expense we pay on our portfolio borrowings  subordinated debt and convertible preferred debentures 
prior to our exit from the mortgage lending business in march  net interest income was also earned on the majority of loan originations by hc for the period of time commencing upon the closing of a loan and ending upon the sale of such loan to a third party 
other income expense 
other income expense includes loan losses for costs incurred with respect to the disposition of non performing or early payment default loans we have originated or purchased from third parties or from losses incurred on non performing loans held in securitization trusts 
in addition  other income expense includes net gains losses from the sale of investments securities or the early termination of interest rate swaps 
expenses 
expenses we incur in our business consist primarily of salary and employee benefits  rent for office space and equipment expenses  and other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses include expenses for professional fees  office supplies  postage and shipping  telephone  insurance  travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
beginning in  expenses include the fees payable to hcs pursuant to the advisory agreement 
income loss from discontinued operation 
income loss from discontinued operations includes all revenues and expenses related to our discontinued mortgage lending business excluding those costs that will be retained by us 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information regarding our discontinued operations 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and dollar amounts in thousands for the years ended december  change change net interest income other income expense total expenses income loss for continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net gain loss basic gain loss per share diluted gain loss per share for the year ended december   we reported net income of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december   which represents a million improvement 
the increase in net income was due primarily to significantly improved operating conditions  a first quarter portfolio restructuring that resulted in increased portfolio yields  and reduced borrowing costs that have resulted from a lower interest rate environment 
the large realized loss recorded in was primarily a result of the march market disruption and the company s response to that disruption 
the company sold an aggregate of million of agency rmbs in its portfolio during march in an effort to reduce its leverage and improve its liquidity position in response to the market disruption and incurred a loss of million 
in addition  the company terminated a total of million of notional interest rate swaps in the quarter ended march   resulting in a realized loss of million 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss of million was due to the following factors million improvement in net interest margin due mainly from reduced financing costs  million net earnings improvement in our discontinued operations which was due to the sale of the mortgage origination business in march of  offset by an increase in realized losses from sale of securities and termination of interest rate swaps in comparative net interest income for the years ended december  average balance amount yield rate average balance amount yield rate average balance amount yield rate millions millions millions interest income investment securities and loans held in the securitization trusts amortization of net premium interest income interest expense investment securities and loans held in the securitization trusts subordinated debentures convertible preferred debentures interest expense net interest income the increase in net interest income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of the restructuring of our investment securities portfolio during  which included the sale of million of lower yielding agency cmo floaters  the purchase of million of clo s that generally return a higher yield than the agency cmo floaters we sold and the addition of approximately million of non agency rmbs at a discounted price of of par value 
in addition  our loans held in securitization trusts contributed to the improvement in net interest income for the year ended december  our portfolio of loans held in securitization trusts realized net margins of approximately basis points for the year ended december  the operating results for our mortgage portfolio management business during a given period typically reflect the net interest spread earned on our investment portfolio of residential mortgage securities and loans as well as clo 
the net interest spread is impacted by factors such as our cost of financing  the interest rate our investments are earning and our interest hedging strategies 
furthermore  the cost of loans held in our portfolio  the amount of premium or discount paid on purchased portfolio investments and the prepayment rates on portfolio investments will impact the net interest spread as such factors will be amortized over the expected term of such investments 
for our portfolio of investment securities  mortgage loans held for investments and loans held in securitization trusts  our net interest spread as well as average cpr by quarter since we began our portfolio investment activities is as follows quarter ended average interest earning assets millions weighted average coupon weighted average cash yield on interest earning assets cost of funds net interest spread constant prepayment rate cpr december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  comparative expenses for the year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands change change salaries and benefits professional fees insurance management fees other total expenses the changes in expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are due to the following million increase in payroll due to increased compensation for performance related bonuses in million increase in management fees related to incentive fee payments earned in million decrease in other expenses due to one time penalty fees of million paid in related to delayed shelf registration filing for our private placement of common stock 
the increase in total expenses for the year ended december  as compared to total expenses for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the sale of our mortgage lending business and the classification of that business in as a discontinued operation 
prior to the sale of our mortgage lending business  certain expenses of our company were part of our discontinued mortgage lending business and are included as expenses of our discontinued operation for the year ended december  discontinued operations for the year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands change change revenues net interest income gain on sale of mortgage loans loan losses brokered loan fees gain on sale of retail lending segment other income expense total net revenues expenses salaries  commissions and benefits brokered loan expenses occupancy and equipment general and administrative total expenses income loss before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit gain loss from discontinued operations net of tax off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not maintained any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  fund our operations  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we recognize the need to have funds available for our operating businesses and meet these potential cash requirements 
our investments and assets generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through mortgage principal and interest payments  prepayments and net earnings held prior to payment of dividends 
in addition  depending on market conditions  the sale of investment securities or capital market transactions may provide additional liquidity 
we intend to meet our liquidity needs through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
at december   we had cash balances of million  million in unencumbered securities  including million of agency rmbs and borrowings of million under outstanding repurchase agreements 
at december   we also had longer term capital resources  including cdos outstanding of million and subordinated debt of million 
the company also has million of its series a convertible preferred stock outstanding  net of deferred issuance costs 
the series a preferred stock matures on december   at which time we must redeem any outstanding shares at the per share liquidation preference plus any accrued and unpaid dividends at that time 
the series a preferred stock is convertible into shares of the company s common stock based on a conversion price of per share of common stock  which represents a conversion rate of two and one half shares of common stock for each share of series a preferred stock 
as of march   our common stock was trading below the conversion price for our series a preferred stock 
as a result  as of december   of the series a preferred stock remained outstanding  which represents an aggregate redemption price excluding accrued and unpaid dividends of approximately million 
in the event we are required to redeem all or a portion of the outstanding series a preferred stock at december   we expect to use working capital to satisfy the redemption terms 
based on our current investment portfolio  leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements  we believe our existing cash balances  funds available under our current repurchase agreements and cash flows from operations will meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
given the continued uncertainty in the credit markets  we believe that maintaining a maximum leverage ratio in the range of to times for our agency rmbs portfolio and an overall company leverage ratio of to times is appropriate at this time 
at december  the leverage ratio for our portfolio of agency rmbs  which we define as our outstanding indebtedness under repurchase agreements divided by the sum of total stockholders equity and our series a preferred stock  was to and  excluding our series a preferred stock  the leverage ratio was to we had outstanding repurchase agreements  a form of collateralized short term borrowing  with five different financial institutions as of december  these agreements are secured by our agency rmbs and bear interest rates that have historically moved in close relationship to libor 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements are based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
interest rate changes can have a negative impact on the valuation of these securities  reducing the amount we can borrow under these agreements 
moreover  our repurchase agreements allow the counterparties to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions and because these lines of financing are not committed  the counterparty can call the loan at any time 
if a counterparty determines that the value of the collateral has decreased  the counterparty may initiate a margin call and require us to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding borrowing  on minimal notice 
moreover  in the event an existing counterparty elected to not reset the outstanding balance at its maturity into a new repurchase agreement  we would be required to repay the outstanding balance with cash or proceeds received from a new counterparty or to surrender the mortgage backed securities that serve as collateral for the outstanding balance  or any combination thereof 
if we are unable to secure financing from a new counterparty and had to surrender the collateral  we would expect to incur a significant loss 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements as a mechanism to reduce the interest rate risk of the rmbs portfolio 
at december   we had million in notional interest rate swaps outstanding 
should market rates for similar term interest rate swaps drop below the fixed rates we have agreed to on our interest rate swaps  we will be required to post additional margin to the swap counterparty  reducing available liquidity 
at december  the company pledged million in cash margin to cover decreased valuation of the interest rate swaps 
the weighted average maturity of the swaps was years at december  we also own approximately million of loans held for sale 
our inability to sell these loans at all or on favorable terms could adversely affect our profitability as any sale for less than the current reserved balance would result in a loss 
currently  these loans are not financed or pledged 
as it relates to loans sold previously under certain loan sale agreements by our discontinued mortgage lending business  we may be required to repurchase some of those loans or indemnify the loan purchaser for damages caused by a breach of the loan sale agreement 
while in the past we complied with the repurchase demands by repurchasing the loan with cash and reselling it at a loss  thus reducing our cash position  more recently we have addressed these requests by negotiating a net cash settlement based on the actual or assumed loss on the loan in lieu of repurchasing the loans 
the company periodically receives repurchase requests  each of which management reviews to determine  based on management s experience  whether such request may reasonably be deemed to have merit 
as of december   we had a total of million of unresolved repurchase requests that management concluded may reasonably be deemed to have merit  against which we had a reserve of approximately million 
we paid quarterly cash dividends of   and per common share in january  april  july  and october  respectively 
on december   we declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of per common share 
the dividend was paid on january  to common stockholders of record as of january  on january   we paid a per share cash dividend  or approximately million in the aggregate  on shares of our series a preferred stock to holders of record as of december  we also paid a   and per share cash dividend on shares of our series a preferred stock in january  april  july  and october  respectively 
each of these dividends was paid out of the company s working capital 
we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and our series a preferred stock during it term 
however  our board of directors will continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter and will make adjustments as necessary  based on a variety of factors  including  among other things  the need to maintain our reit status  our financial condition  liquidity  earnings projections and business prospects 
our dividend policy does not constitute an obligation to pay dividends  which only occurs when our board of directors declares a dividend 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the various requirements to maintain our reit status and to minimize or avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
however  differences in timing between the recognition of reit taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements and to avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
inflation for the periods presented herein  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
the impact of inflation is primarily reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
virtually all our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
our consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates typically increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
during periods of increasing interest rates  demand for mortgages and a borrower s ability to qualify for mortgage financing in a purchase transaction may be adversely affected 
during periods of decreasing interest rates  borrowers may prepay their mortgages  which in turn may adversely affect our yield and subsequently the value of our portfolio of mortgage assets 
contractual obligations and commitments the company had the following contractual obligations at december  amounts in thousands total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases repurchase agreements cdos subordinated debentures convertible preferred debentures interest rate swaps management fees total contractual obligations amounts include projected interest payments during the period 
interest based on interest rates in effect on december  maturities of our cdos are dependent upon cash flows received from the underlying loans receivable 
our estimate of their repayment is based on scheduled principal payments and estimated principal prepayments based on our internal prepayment model on the underlying loans receivable 
this estimate will differ from actual amounts to the extent prepayments and or loan losses are experienced 
amounts include projected dividend payments on the series a preferred stock 
quarterly dividend rate based on the quarterly dividend paid on january  the calculation of the dividend rate is merely a projection for the purposes of this table and does not represent an obligation of the company to pay all or any portion of the projected dividend amount 
amounts due under our advisory agreement with hcs see below are based on assets under management as of december  advisory agreement on january   we entered into an advisory agreement with hcs  pursuant to which hcs advises  manages and makes investments on behalf of the managed subsidiaries 
pursuant to the advisory agreement  hcs is entitled to receive the following compensation base advisory fee equal to per annum of the equity capital as defined in item of this annual report of the managed subsidiaries payable by us to hcs in cash  quarterly in arrears  and incentive compensation equal to of the gaap net income of the managed subsidiaries attributable to the investments that are managed by hcs that exceed a hurdle rate equal to the greater of a and b plus the ten year treasury rate for such fiscal year payable by us to hcs in cash  quarterly in arrears  provided  however  that a portion of the incentive compensation may be paid in shares of our common stock 
if we terminate the advisory agreement other than for cause or elect not to renew it  we will be required to pay hcs a cash termination fee equal to the sum of i the average annual base advisory fee and ii the average annual incentive compensation earned during the month period immediately preceding the date of termination 
significance of estimates and critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  many of which require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates are based  in part  on our judgment and assumptions regarding various economic conditions that we believe are reasonable based on facts and circumstances existing at the time of reporting 
the results of these estimates affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income  expenses and other comprehensive income during the periods presented 
changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on these financial statements 
accounting policies and estimates related to specific components of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sec guidance  those material accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and which require complex management judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
interest income on our prime arm loans held in securitization trusts and rmbs is a combination of the interest earned based on the outstanding principal balance of the underlying loan security  the contractual terms of the assets and the amortization of yield adjustments  principally premiums and discounts  using generally accepted interest methods 
the net gaap cost over the par balance of self originated loans held for investment and premium and discount associated with the purchase of rmbs and loans are amortized into interest income over the lives of the underlying assets using the effective yield method as adjusted for the effects of estimated prepayments 
estimating prepayments and the remaining term of our interest yield investments require management s judgment  which involves  among other things  consideration of possible future interest rate environments and an estimate of how borrowers will react to those environments  historical trends and performance 
the actual prepayment speed and actual lives could be more or less than the amount estimated by management at the time of origination or purchase of the assets or at each financial reporting period 
fair value 
the company has established and documented processes for determining fair values 
fair value is based upon quoted market prices  where available 
if listed prices or quotes are not available  then fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use inputs that are market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
the following describes the valuation methodologies used for the company s financial instruments measured at fair value  as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 
a 
investment securities available for sale rmbs fair value for the rmbs in our portfolio is based on quoted prices provided by dealers who make markets in similar financial instruments 
the dealers will incorporate common market pricing methods  including a spread measurement to the treasury curve or interest rate swap curve as well as underlying characteristics of the particular security including coupon  periodic and life caps  collateral type  rate reset period and seasoning or age of the security 
if quoted prices for a security are not reasonably available from a dealer  the security will be re classified as a level security and  as a result  management will determine the fair value based on characteristics of the security that the company receives from the issuer and based on available market information 
management reviews all prices used in determining valuation to ensure they represent current market conditions 
this review includes surveying similar market transactions  comparisons to interest pricing models as well as offerings of like securities by dealers 
the company s investment securities that are comprised of rmbs are valued based upon readily observable market parameters and are classified as level fair values 
b 
investment securities available for sale clo the fair value of the clo notes  as of december   was based on management s valuation determined by using a discounted future cash flows model that management believes would be used by market participants to value similar financial instruments 
if a reliable market for these assets develops in the future  management will consider quoted prices provided by dealers who make markets in similar financial instruments in determining the fair value of the clo notes 
the clo notes are classified as level fair values 
c 
interest rate swaps and caps the fair value of interest rate swaps and caps are based on using market accepted financial models as well as dealer quotes 
the model utilizes readily observable market parameters  including treasury rates  interest rate swap spreads and swaption volatility curves 
the company s interest rate caps and swaps are classified as level fair values 
mortgage loans held for sale net the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale net are estimated by the company based on the price that would be received if the loans were sold as whole loans taking into consideration the aggregated characteristics of the loans such as  but not limited to  collateral type  index  interest rate  margin  length of fixed interest rate period  life cap  periodic cap  underwriting standards  age and credit 
mortgage loans held in securitization trusts net impaired loans impaired mortgage loans held in the securitization trusts are recorded at amortized cost less specific loan loss reserves 
impaired loan value is based on management s estimate of the net realizable value taking into consideration local market conditions of the distressed property  updated appraisal values of the property and estimated expenses required to remediate the impaired loan 
real estate owned held in securitization trusts real estate owned held in the securitization trusts are recorded at net realizable value 
any subsequent adjustment will result in the reduction in carrying value with the corresponding amount charge to earnings 
net realizable value based on an estimate of disposal taking into consideration local market conditions of the distressed property  updated appraisal values of the property and estimated expenses required sell the property

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
because we are invested solely in us dollar denominated instruments  primarily residential mortgage instruments  and our borrowings are also domestic and us dollar denominated  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange  or commodity and equity price risk  the primary market risk that we are exposed to is interest rate risk and its related ancillary risks 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
all of our market risk sensitive assets  liabilities and related derivative positions are for non trading purposes only 
management recognizes the following primary risks associated with our business and the industry in which we conduct business interest rate risk liquidity risk prepayment risk credit risk market fair value risk interest rate risk interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary  tax policies  domestic and international economic conditions  and political or regulatory matters beyond our control 
changes in interest rates affect the value of our investment securities and arm loans we manage and hold in our investment portfolio  the variable rate borrowings we use to finance our portfolio  and the interest rate swaps and caps we use to hedge our portfolio 
all of our portfolio interest market risk sensitive assets  liabilities and related derivative positions are managed with a long term perspective and are not for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is measured by the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows  especially the speed at which prepayments occur on our residential mortgage related assets 
changes in interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our borrowings 
our adjustable rate hybrid arm assets reset on various dates that are not matched to the reset dates on our repurchase agreements 
in general  the repricing of our repurchase agreements occurs more quickly than the repricing of our assets 
first  our floating rate borrowings may react to changes in interest rates before our adjustable rate assets because the weighted average next re pricing dates on the related borrowings may have shorter time periods than that of the adjustable rate assets 
second  interest rates on adjustable rate assets may be limited to a periodic cap or an increase of typically or per adjustment period  while our borrowings do not have comparable limitations 
third  our adjustable rate assets typically lag changes in the applicable interest rate indices by days due to the notice period provided to adjustable rate borrowers when the interest rates on their loans are scheduled to change 
we seek to manage interest rate risk in the portfolio by utilizing interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  with the goal of optimizing the earnings potential while seeking to maintain long term stable portfolio values 
we continually monitor the duration of our mortgage assets and have a policy to hedge the financing such that the net duration of the assets  our borrowed funds related to such assets  and related hedging instruments  are less than one year 
interest rates can also affect our net return on hybrid arm securities and loans net of the cost of financing hybrid arms 
we continually monitor and estimate the duration of our hybrid arms and have a policy to hedge the financing of the hybrid arms such that the net duration of the hybrid arms  our borrowed funds related to such assets  and related hedging instruments are less than one year 
during a declining interest rate environment  the prepayment of hybrid arms may accelerate as borrowers may opt to refinance at a lower rate causing the amount of liabilities that have been extended by the use of interest rate swaps to increase relative to the amount of hybrid arms  possibly resulting in a decline in our net return on hybrid arms as replacement hybrid arms may have a lower yield than those being prepaid 
conversely  during an increasing interest rate environment  hybrid arms may prepay slower than expected  requiring us to finance a higher amount of hybrid arms than originally forecast and at a time when interest rates may be higher  resulting in a decline in our net return on hybrid arms 
our exposure to changes in the prepayment speeds of hybrid arms is mitigated by regular monitoring of the outstanding balance of hybrid arms  and adjusting the amounts anticipated to be outstanding in future periods and  on a regular basis  making adjustments to the amount of our fixed rate borrowing obligations for future periods 
we utilize a model based risk analysis system to assist in projecting portfolio performances over a scenario of different interest rates 
the model incorporates shifts in interest rates  changes in prepayments and other factors impacting the valuations of our financial securities  including mortgage backed securities  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
based on the results of the model  as of december   instantaneous changes in interest rates would have had the following effect on net interest income dollar amounts in thousands changes in net interest income changes in interest rates changes in net interest income interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our mortgage assets and related hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our mortgage assets decrease and as interest rates decrease  the value of such investments will increase 
in general  we would expect however that  over time  decreases in value of our portfolio attributable to interest rate changes will be offset  to the degree we are hedged  by increases in value of our interest rate swaps  and vice versa 
however  the relationship between spreads on securities and spreads on swaps may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decline 
that said  unless there is a material impairment in value that would result in a payment not being received on a security or loan  changes in the book value of our portfolio will not directly affect our recurring earnings or our ability to make a distribution to our stockholders 
liquidity risk liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we recognize the need to have funds available to operate our business 
it is our policy to have adequate liquidity at all times 
we plan to meet liquidity through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
our principal sources of liquidity are the repurchase agreements on our rmbs  the cdos we have issued to finance our loans held in securitization trusts  the principal and interest payments from mortgage assets and cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities as market and other conditions permit 
we believe our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
as it relates to our investment portfolio  derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk subject us to margin call risk 
if the value of our pledged assets decrease  due to a change in interest rates  credit characteristics  or other pricing factors  we may be required to post additional cash or asset collateral  or reduce the amount we are able to borrower versus the collateral 
under our interest rate swaps typically we pay a fixed rate to the counterparties while they pay us a floating rate 
if interest rates drop below the fixed rate we are paying on an interest rate swap  we may be required to post cash margin 
prepayment risk when borrowers repay the principal on their mortgage loans before maturity or faster than their scheduled amortization  the effect is to shorten the period over which interest is earned  and therefore  reduce the yield for mortgage assets purchased at a premium to their then current balance  as with the majority of our assets 
conversely  mortgage assets purchased for less than their then current balance exhibit higher yields due to faster prepayments 
furthermore  prepayment speeds exceeding or lower than our modeled prepayment speeds impact the effectiveness of any hedges we have in place to mitigate financing and or fair value risk 
generally  when market interest rates decline  borrowers have a tendency to refinance their mortgages  thereby increasing prepayments 
our prepayment model will help determine the amount of hedging we use to off set changes in interest rates 
if actual prepayment rates are higher than modeled  the yield will be less than modeled in cases where we paid a premium for the particular mortgage asset 
conversely  when we have paid a premium  if actual prepayment rates experienced are slower than modeled  we would amortize the premium over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
in an increasing prepayment environment  the timing difference between the actual cash receipt of principal paydowns and the announcement of the principal paydown may result in additional margin requirements from our repurchase agreement counterparties 
we mitigate prepayment risk by constantly evaluating our mortgage assets relative to prepayment speeds observed for assets with a similar structure  quality and characteristics 
furthermore  we stress test the portfolio as to prepayment speeds and interest rate risk in order to further develop or make modifications to our hedge balances 
historically  we have not hedged of our liability costs due to prepayment risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk that we will not fully collect the principal we have invested in mortgage loans or other assets due to either borrower defaults  or a counterparty failure 
our portfolio of loans held in securitization trusts as of december  consisted of approximately million of securitized first liens originated in and earlier 
the securitized first liens were principally originated in by our subsidiary  hc  prior to our exit from the mortgage lending business 
these are predominately high quality loans with an average loan to value ltv ratio at origination of approximately  and average borrower fico score of approximately in addition  approximately of these loans were originated with full income and asset verification 
while we feel that our origination and underwriting of these loans will help to mitigate the risk of significant borrower default on these loans  we cannot assure you that all borrowers will continue to satisfy their payment obligations under these loans and thereby avoid default 
as of december   we owned approximately million on non agency rmbs senior securities 
the non agency rmbs has a weighted average amortized purchase price of approximately of current par value 
management believes the purchase price discount coupled with the credit support within the bond structure protects us from principal loss under most stress scenarios for these non agency rmbs 
in addition  as of december  we own approximately million of par value of clos  with a carrying value of million and a discounted purchase price of approximately of par 
the securities are backed by a portfolio of middle market corporate loans 
market fair value risk changes in interest rates also expose us to market risk that the market value fair value on our assets may decline 
for certain of the financial instruments that we own  fair values will not be readily available since there are no active trading markets for these instruments as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  fair values can only be derived or estimated for these investments using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently subjective and imprecise 
minor changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these derived or estimated fair values 
these estimates and assumptions are indicative of the interest rate environments as of december   and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations 
we note that the values of our investments in mortgage backed securities and in derivative instruments  primarily interest rate hedges on our debt  will be sensitive to changes in market interest rates  interest rate spreads  credit spreads and other market factors 
the value of these investments can vary and has varied materially from period to period 
historically  the values of our mortgage loan portfolio have tended to vary inversely with those of its derivative instruments 
the following describes the methods and assumptions we use in estimating fair values of our financial instruments fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques 
these techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments  discount rates  estimate of future cashflows  future expected loss experience and other factors 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values 
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument 
also  because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values  the fair values used by us should not be compared to those of other companies 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally based on market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these financial instruments 
if the fair value of a security is not reasonably available from a dealer  management estimates the fair value based on characteristics of the security that the we receive from the issuer and on available market information 
the fair value of mortgage loans held in securitization trusts is estimated using pricing models and taking into consideration the aggregated characteristics of groups of loans such as  but not limited to  collateral type  index  interest rate  margin  length of fixed rate period  life cap  periodic cap  underwriting standards  age and credit estimated using the estimated market prices for similar types of loans 
due to significant market dislocation over the past months  secondary market prices were given minimal weighting when arriving at loan valuation at december  and december  fair value 
the fair value of these cdos is based on discounted cashflows as well as market pricing on comparable cdos 
the market risk management discussion and the amounts estimated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements that assume that certain market conditions occur 
actual results may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in our portfolio assets and borrowings mix and due to developments in the domestic and global financial and real estate markets 
developments in the financial markets include the likelihood of changing interest rates and the relationship of various interest rates and their impact on our portfolio yield  cost of funds and cash flows 
the analytical methods that we use to assess and mitigate these market risks should not be considered projections of future events or operating performance 
as a financial institution that has only invested in us dollar denominated instruments  primarily residential mortgage instruments  and has only borrowed money in the domestic market  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
rather  our market risk exposure is largely due to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk impacts our interest income  interest expense and the market value on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
the management of interest rate risk attempts to maximize earnings and to preserve capital by minimizing the negative impacts of changing market rates  asset and liability mix  and prepayment activity 
the table below presents the sensitivity of the market value and net duration changes of our portfolio as of december   using a discounted cash flow simulation model assuming an instantaneous interest rate shift 
application of this method results in an estimation of the fair market value change of our assets  liabilities and hedging instruments per basis point bp shift in interest rates 
the use of hedging instruments is a critical part of our interest rate risk management strategies  and the effects of these hedging instruments on the market value of the portfolio are reflected in the model s output 
this analysis also takes into consideration the value of options embedded in our mortgage assets including constraints on the re pricing of the interest rate of assets resulting from periodic and lifetime cap features  as well as prepayment options 
assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive such as cash  payment receivables  prepaid expenses  payables and accrued expenses are excluded 
changes in assumptions including  but not limited to  volatility  mortgage and financing spreads  prepayment behavior  defaults  as well as the timing and level of interest rate changes will affect the results of the model 
therefore  actual results are likely to vary from modeled results 
market value changes changes in interest rates changes in market value net duration amount in thousands years years base years years it should be noted that the model is used as a tool to identify potential risk in a changing interest rate environment but does not include any changes in portfolio composition  financing strategies  market spreads or changes in overall market liquidity 
based on the assumptions used  the model output suggests a very low degree of portfolio price change given increases in interest rates  which implies that our cash flow and earning characteristics should be relatively stable for comparable changes in interest rates 
although market value sensitivity analysis is widely accepted in identifying interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration changes that may occur such as  but not limited to  changes in investment and financing strategies  changes in market spreads and changes in business volumes 
accordingly  we make extensive use of an earnings simulation model to further analyze our level of interest rate risk 
there are a number of key assumptions in our earnings simulation model 
these key assumptions include changes in market conditions that affect interest rates  the pricing of arm products  the availability of investment assets and the availability and the cost of financing for portfolio assets 
other key assumptions made in using the simulation model include prepayment speeds and management s investment  financing and hedging strategies  and the issuance of new equity 
we typically run the simulation model under a variety of hypothetical business scenarios that may include different interest rate scenarios  different investment strategies  different prepayment possibilities and other scenarios that provide us with a range of possible earnings outcomes in order to assess potential interest rate risk 
the assumptions used represent our estimate of the likely effect of changes in interest rates and do not necessarily reflect actual results 
the earnings simulation model takes into account periodic and lifetime caps embedded in our assets in determining the earnings at risk
