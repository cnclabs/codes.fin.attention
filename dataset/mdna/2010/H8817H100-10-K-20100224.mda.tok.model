background in november  we completed our merger transaction the merger with globalsantafe corporation globalsantafe 
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger  each of transocean inc s outstanding ordinary shares was reclassified by way of a scheme of arrangement under cayman islands law into transocean inc ordinary shares and in cash the reclassification and together with the merger  the gsf transactions 
at the effective time of the merger  each outstanding ordinary share of globalsantafe the globalsantafe ordinary shares was exchanged for transocean inc ordinary shares after giving effect to the reclassification and in cash 
transocean inc issued approximately  of its ordinary shares in connection with the merger and distributed billion in cash in connection with the gsf transactions 
transocean inc funded the payment of the cash consideration for the gsf transactions with billion of borrowings under a billion  one year senior unsecured bridge loan facility the bridge loan facility and has since refinanced or repaid those borrowings and terminated the bridge loan facility 
we included the financial results of globalsantafe in our consolidated financial statements beginning november   the date the globalsantafe ordinary shares were exchanged for transocean inc ordinary shares 
in december  transocean ltd 
completed a transaction pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger among transocean ltd  transocean inc  which was our former parent holding company  and transocean cayman ltd  a company organized under the laws of the cayman islands that was a wholly owned subsidiary of transocean ltd  pursuant to which transocean inc merged by way of schemes of arrangement under cayman islands law with transocean cayman ltd  with transocean inc as the surviving company and  as a result  a wholly owned subsidiary of transocean ltd 
the redomestication transaction 
in the redomestication transaction  transocean ltd 
issued one of its shares in exchange for each ordinary share of transocean inc in addition  transocean ltd 
issued million of its shares to transocean inc for future use to satisfy transocean ltd 
s obligations to deliver shares in connection with awards granted under our incentive plans or other rights to acquire shares of transocean ltd 
the redomestication transaction effectively changed the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from the cayman islands to switzerland 
as a result of the redomestication transaction  transocean inc became a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of transocean ltd 
in connection with the redomestication transaction  we relocated our principal executive offices to vernier  switzerland 
we refer to the redomestication transaction and the relocation of our principal executive offices together as the redomestication 

index drilling fleet we principally operate three types of drilling rigs drillships  semisubmersibles  and jackups 
also included in our fleet are barge drilling rigs and a coring drillship 
most of our drilling equipment is suitable for both exploration and development drilling  and we normally engage in both types of drilling activity 
likewise  most of our drilling rigs are mobile and can be moved to new locations in response to customer demand 
all of our mobile offshore drilling units are designed for operations away from port for extended periods of time and most have living quarters for the crews  a helicopter landing deck and storage space for pipe and drilling supplies 
we categorize our fleet as follows high specification floaters  consisting of our ultra deepwater floaters  deepwater floaters and harsh environment floaters  midwater floaters  high specification jackups  standard jackups and other rigs 
as of february   our fleet of rigs  excluding rigs under construction  included high specification floaters  which are comprised of ultra deepwater floaters  deepwater floaters  and five harsh environment floaters  midwater floaters  high specification jackups  standard jackups  and three other rigs  which are comprised of two barge drilling rigs  and one coring drillship 
as of february   our fleet was located in the far east units  uk north sea units  middle east units  uk gulf of mexico units  west african countries other than nigeria and angola units  india units  brazil units  nigeria seven units  angola six units  norway five units  the mediterranean four units  trinidad two units  australia two units  canada two units  the netherlands one unit and the caspian sea one unit 
high specification floaters are specialized offshore drilling units that we categorize into three sub classifications based on their capabilities 
ultra deepwater floaters have high pressure mud pumps and a water depth capability of  feet or greater 
deepwater floaters are generally those other semisubmersible rigs and drillships that have a water depth capacity between  and  feet 
harsh environment floaters have a water depth capacity between  and  feet  are capable of drilling in harsh environments and have greater displacement  resulting in larger variable load capacity  more useable deck space and better motion characteristics 
midwater floaters are generally comprised of those non high specification semisubmersibles with a water depth capacity of less than  feet 
high specification jackups consist of our harsh environment and high performance jackups  and standard jackups consist of our remaining jackup fleet 
other rigs consist of rigs that are of a different type or use than those mentioned above 
drillships are generally self propelled  shaped like conventional ships and are the most mobile of the major rig types 
all of our high specification drillships are dynamically positioned  which allows them to maintain position without anchors through the use of their onboard propulsion and station keeping systems 
drillships typically have greater load capacity than early generation semisubmersible rigs 
this enables them to carry more supplies on board  which often makes them better suited for drilling in remote locations where resupply is more difficult 
however  drillships are typically limited to calmer water conditions than those in which semisubmersibles can operate 
our five existing enhanced enterprise class and enterprise class drillships are  and four of our five additional newbuild drillships contracted for or under construction will be  equipped with our patented dual activity technology 
dual activity technology includes structures  equipment and techniques for using two drilling stations within a single derrick to perform drilling tasks 
dual activity technology allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner 
dual activity technology reduces critical path activity and improves efficiency in both exploration and development drilling 
semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be submerged by means of a water ballast system such that the lower hulls are below the water surface during drilling operations 
these rigs are capable of maintaining their position over the well through the use of an anchoring system or a computer controlled dynamic positioning thruster system 
some semisubmersible rigs are self propelled and move between locations under their own power when afloat on pontoons although most are relocated with the assistance of tugs 
typically  semisubmersibles are better suited than drillships for operations in rougher water conditions 
our three express class semisubmersibles are designed for mild environments and are equipped with the unique tri act derrick  which was designed to reduce overall well construction costs 
the tri act derrick allows offline tubular and riser handling operations to occur at two sides of the derrick while the center portion of the derrick is being used for normal drilling operations through the rotary table 
our three development driller class semisubmersibles are equipped with our patented dual activity technology 

index jackup rigs are mobile self elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that can be lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform 
once a foundation is established  the drilling platform is then jacked further up the legs so that the platform is above the highest expected waves 
these rigs are generally suited for water depths of feet or less 
we classify certain of our jackup rigs as high specification jackups 
these rigs have greater operational capabilities than standard jackups and are able to operate in harsh environments  have higher capacity derricks  drawworks  mud systems and storage  and are typically capable of drilling to deeper depths 
typically  these jackups also have deeper water depth capacity than standard jackups 
depending on market conditions  we may idle or stack non contracted rigs 
an idle rig is between contracts  readily available for operations  and operating costs are typically at or near normal levels 
a stacked rig is manned by a reduced crew or unmanned and typically has reduced operating costs and is a preparing for an extended period of inactivity  b expected to continue to be inactive for an extended period  or c completing a period of extended inactivity 
some idle rigs and all stacked rigs require additional costs to return to service 
the actual cost  which could fluctuate over time  depends upon various factors  including the availability and cost of shipyard facilities  cost of equipment and materials and the extent of repairs and maintenance that may ultimately be required 
under certain circumstances  the cost could be significant 
we consider these factors  together with market conditions  length of contract and dayrate and other contract terms  when deciding whether to return a stacked rig to service 
we may consider marketing stacked rigs as accommodation units or for other alternative uses  from time to time  until drilling activity increases and we obtain drilling contracts for these units 
as of february   we owned all of the drilling rigs in our fleet noted in the tables below  except for the following those specifically described as being owned wholly or in part by unaffiliated parties  gsf explorer  which is subject to a capital lease through july gsf jack ryan  which is subject to a fully defeased capital lease through november and petrobras  which is subject to a capital lease through august in the tables presented below  the location of each rig indicates the current drilling location for operating rigs or the next operating location for rigs in shipyards with a follow on contract  unless otherwise noted

index markets our operations are geographically dispersed in oil and gas exploration and development areas throughout the world 
although the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the balance between supply and demand to vary between regions  significant variations do not tend to exist long term because of rig mobility 
consequently  we operate in a single  global offshore drilling market 
because our drilling rigs are mobile assets and are able to be moved according to prevailing market conditions  we cannot predict the percentage of our revenues that will be derived from particular geographic or political areas in future periods 
in recent years  there has been increased emphasis by oil companies on exploring for hydrocarbons in deeper waters 
this deepwater focus is due  in part  to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost effective 
therefore  water depth capability is a key component in determining rig suitability for a particular drilling project 
another distinguishing feature in some drilling market sectors is a rig s ability to operate in harsh environments  including extreme marine and climatic conditions and temperatures 
the deepwater and midwater market sectors are serviced by our semisubmersibles and drillships 
although the term deepwater as used in the drilling industry to denote a particular sector of the market can vary and continues to evolve with technological improvements  we generally view the deepwater market sector as that which begins in water depths of approximately  feet and extends to the maximum water depths in which rigs are capable of drilling  which is currently approximately  feet 
we view the midwater market sector as that which covers water depths of about feet to approximately  feet 
the global jackup market sector begins at the outer limit of the transition zone and extends to water depths of about feet 
this sector has been developed to a significantly greater degree than the deepwater market sector because the shallower water depths have made it much more affordable and accessible than the deeper water market sectors 
the transition zone market sector is characterized by marshes  rivers  lakes  and shallow bay and coastal water areas 
we operate in this sector using our two barge drilling rigs located in southeast asia 
contract backlog our contract backlog at december  was approximately billion  representing a percent and percent decrease compared to our contract backlog of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook drilling market and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations performance and other key indicators

index contract drilling services our contracts to provide offshore drilling services are individually negotiated and vary in their terms and provisions 
we obtain most of our contracts through competitive bidding against other contractors 
drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis  with higher rates while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control 
a dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or covering a stated term 
certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment 
such payments may not  however  fully compensate us for the loss of the contract 
contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee  under various circumstances such as non performance  in the event of downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues  or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events 
many of these events are beyond our control 
the contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term 
our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the customer to extend the contract to finish drilling a well in progress 
during periods of depressed market conditions  our customers may seek to renegotiate firm drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts 
suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension 
if our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see item a 
risk factors our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events 
drilling management services we provide drilling management services primarily on a turnkey basis through applied drilling technology inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  which primarily operates in the us gulf of mexico  and through adt international  a division of one of our uk subsidiaries  which primarily operates in the north sea together  adti 
as part of our turnkey drilling services  we provide planning  engineering and management services beyond the scope of our traditional contract drilling business and  thereby  assume greater risk 
under turnkey arrangements  we typically assume responsibility for the design and execution of a well and deliver a logged or cased hole to an agreed depth for a guaranteed price for which payment is contingent upon successful completion of the well program 
in addition to turnkey drilling services  we participate in project management operations that include providing certain planning  management and engineering services  purchasing equipment and providing personnel and other logistical services to customers 
our project management services differ from turnkey drilling services in that the customer assumes control of the drilling operations and thereby retains the risks associated with the project 
these drilling management services revenues represented less than three percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  in the course of providing drilling management services  adti may use a drilling rig in our fleet or contract for a rig owned by another contract driller 
integrated services from time to time  we provide well and logistics services in addition to our normal drilling services through third party contractors and our employees 
we refer to these other services as integrated services  which are generally subject to individual contractual agreements executed to meet specific customer needs and may be provided on either a dayrate  cost plus or fixed price basis  depending on the daily activity 
as of february   we were only performing such services in india 
these integrated services revenues represented less than two percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  oil and gas properties we conduct oil and gas exploration  development and production activities through our oil and gas subsidiaries 
we acquire interests in oil and gas properties principally in order to facilitate the awarding of turnkey contracts for our drilling management services operations 
our oil and gas activities are conducted through challenger minerals inc and challenger minerals north sea limited together  cmi  which holds property interests primarily in the us offshore louisiana and texas and in the uk sector of the north sea 
the oil and gas properties revenues represented less than one percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  joint venture  agency and sponsorship relationships and other investments in some areas of the world  local customs and practice or governmental requirements necessitate the formation of joint ventures with local participation  which we may or may not control 
we are an active participant in several joint venture drilling companies  principally in angola  india  indonesia  malaysia and nigeria 
local laws or customs in some areas of the world also effectively mandate establishment of a relationship with a local agent or sponsor 
when appropriate in these areas  we enter into agency or sponsorship agreements 

index we hold a percent interest in transocean pacific drilling inc tpdi  a british virgin islands joint venture company formed by us and pacific drilling limited pacific drilling  a liberian company  to own two ultra deepwater drillships named dhirubhai deepwater kg and dhirubhai deepwater kg  the latter of which is currently under construction and expected to be completed in the first quarter of under a management services agreement with tpdi  we currently provide construction management services for the dhirubhai deepwater kg and operating management services for the dhirubhai deepwater kg  and we have agreed to provide operating management services for the dhirubhai deepwater kg after the drillship commences operations 
beginning on october   pacific drilling will have the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for our shares or cash at a purchase price based on an appraisal of the fair value of the drillships  subject to various adjustments 
we hold a percent interest in angola deepwater drilling company limited addcl  a cayman islands joint venture company formed to construct  own and operate an ultra deepwater drillship to be named discoverer luanda 
angco cayman limited  a cayman islands company  holds the remaining percent interest in addcl 
under a management services agreement with addcl  we provide construction management services and have agreed to provide operating management services once the drillship begins operations  which is currently expected to be in the third quarter of beginning on the fifth anniversary of the first well commencement date  angco cayman limited will have the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for cash at a purchase price based on an appraisal of the fair value of the drillship  subject to various adjustments 
we hold a percent interest in overseas drilling limited odl  an unconsolidated cayman islands joint venture company  which owns the drillship joides resolution 
the drillship is contracted to perform drilling and coring operations in deep waters worldwide for the purpose of scientific research 
we manage and operate the vessel on behalf of odl 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations related party transactions 
significant customers we engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates  as well as for many government controlled and independent oil companies 
our most significant customer in was bp  accounting for percent of our operating revenues 
the loss of this significant customer could  at least in the short term  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
no other customer accounted for percent or more of our operating revenues 
employees we require highly skilled personnel to operate our drilling units 
we conduct extensive personnel recruiting  training and safety programs 
at december   we had approximately  employees  and we had engaged approximately  persons through contract labor providers 
some of our employees working in angola  the uk and norway  are represented by  and some of our contracted labor work under  collective bargaining agreements 
many of these represented individuals are working under agreements that are subject to ongoing salary negotiation in these negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses  other increased costs or increased operation restrictions as the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employees not just the union members 
additionally  the unions in the uk sought an interpretation of the application of the working time regulations to the offshore sector 
the employment tribunal issued its decision in favor of the unions and held  in part  that offshore workers are entitled to days of annual leave 
such decision has been overturned on appeal by the employment appeal tribunal  but the unions have appealed this decision to the court of session for a hearing in june the application of the working time regulations to the offshore sector could result in higher labor costs and could undermine our ability to obtain a sufficient number of skilled workers in the uk legislation has been introduced in the us congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the us  as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed 
additional unionization efforts  if successful  new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions 
technological innovation we are the world s largest offshore drilling contactor and leading provider of drilling management services worldwide 
our fleet is considered one of the most modern and versatile in the world due to its emphasis on technically demanding sectors of the offshore drilling business 
since launching the offshore industry s first jackup drilling rig in  we have achieved a long history of technological innovations  including the first dynamically positioned drillship  the first rig to drill year round in the north sea  the first semisubmersible rig for sub arctic  year round operations  and the latest generations of ultra deepwater drillships and semisubmersibles 
nine of our existing fleet are  and four of our newbuilds will be  equipped with our patented dual activity technology  which allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner and reduces critical path activity while improving efficiency in both exploration and development drilling 
the effective use of and continued improvements in technology are critical to the maintenance of our competitive position within the drilling services industry 
we expect to continue to develop technology internally or to acquire technology through strategic acquisitions 

index environmental regulation for a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation  see item a 
risk factors compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations 
our operations are subject to a variety of global environmental regulations 
we monitor environmental regulation in each country of operation and  while we see an increase in general environmental regulation  we have made and will continue to make the required expenditures to comply with current and future environmental requirements 
we make expenditures to further our commitment to environmental improvement and the setting of a global environmental standard as part of our wider corporate responsibility effort 
we assess the environmental impacts of our business  specifically in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions  climate change  discharges and waste management 
we report our global emissions data each year through the carbon disclosure project in addition to a description of our actions being undertaken to manage under future emissions legislation under development in a number of countries in north america and europe 
our actions are designed to reduce risk in our future operations and promote sound environmental management 
while we continue to assess further projects designed to reduce our overall emissions  to date  we have not expended material amounts in order to comply with recent legislation  and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or competitive position or materially increase our capital expenditures

item a 
risk factors risks related to our business the worldwide financial and economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  profitability and financial position 
the worldwide financial and economic downturn reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with losses in worldwide equity markets led to an extended worldwide economic recession 
a slowdown in economic activity caused by the recession reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in an extended period of lower oil and natural gas prices 
crude oil prices have declined from record levels in july and natural gas prices have also experienced sharp declines 
declines in commodity prices  along with difficult conditions in the credit markets  have had a negative impact on our business  and this impact could continue or worsen 
demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices 
demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development  and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  including national oil companies 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the immediate levels of exploration  development  and production activity 
perceptions of longer term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects 
lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
additionally  these factors may adversely impact our statement of financial position if they are determined to cause an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets or of our long lived assets or our assets held for sale 
the worldwide financial and economic downturn may also adversely affect the ability of shipyards to meet scheduled deliveries of our newbuild and other shipyard projects 
the worldwide financial and economic downturn may continue to negatively impact our business and financial condition 
the continued economic downturn and related instability in the global financial system has had  and may continue to have  an impact on our business and our financial condition 
our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the economic downturn has impacted lenders participating in our credit facilities and our customers  and an extended or worsening economic downturn may cause them to fail to meet their obligations to us 

index our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry  which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices and other factors 
our business depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration  development and production in offshore areas worldwide 
oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity 
however  higher commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased drilling activity since customers expectations of future commodity prices typically drive demand for our rigs 
also  increased competition for customers drilling budgets could come from  among other areas  land based energy markets in africa  russia  western asian countries  the middle east  the us and elsewhere 
the availability of quality drilling prospects  exploration success  relative production costs  the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect customers drilling campaigns 
worldwide military  political and economic events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future 
oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors  including the following worldwide demand for oil and gas including economic activity in the us and other energy consuming markets  the ability of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production in non opec countries  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves  advances in exploration and development technology  and the worldwide military and political environment  including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in the middle east or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the us  or elsewhere 
our industry is highly competitive and cyclical  with intense price competition 
the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants  none of which has a dominant market share 
drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job  although rig availability and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered 
our industry has historically been cyclical and is impacted by oil and gas price levels and volatility 
there have been periods of high demand  short rig supply and high dayrates  followed by periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
changes in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand  and periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time 
since the onset of the worldwide financial and economic downturn  we have experienced weakness in our midwater floater  high specification jackups and standard jackup markets 
we have idled rigs  and may in the future  idle additional rigs or enter into lower dayrate contracts in response to market conditions 
during prior periods of high utilization and dayrates  industry participants have increased the supply of rigs by ordering the construction of new units 
this has typically resulted in an oversupply of drilling units and has caused a subsequent decline in utilization and dayrates  sometimes for extended periods of time 
there are numerous high specification rigs and jackups under contract for construction 
the entry into service of these new units will increase supply and could curtail a strengthening  or trigger a reduction  in dayrates as rigs are absorbed into the active fleet 
any further increase in construction of new drilling units would likely exacerbate the negative impact on utilization and dayrates 
lower utilization and dayrates could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain classes of our drilling rigs or our goodwill balance if future cash flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying values of these rigs  goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer and or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates  as well as for many government controlled and independent oil companies 
our most significant customer in was bp  accounting for percent of our operating revenues 
the loss of this customer or another significant customer could  at least in the short term  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only semi variable regardless of the dayrate being earned 
in addition  should our rigs incur idle time between contracts  we typically will not reduce the staff on those rigs because we will use the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract 
during times of reduced activity  reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare rigs for stacking  after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed 
in addition  as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another  the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly 
in general  labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation 
equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment 
contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized 

index our shipyard projects and operations are subject to delays and cost overruns 
as of february   we had a total of five deepwater newbuild rig projects 
we also have a variety of other more limited shipyard projects at any given time 
these shipyard projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any such construction project resulting from numerous factors  including the following shipyard availability  shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment  engineering problems  including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment  work stoppages  customer acceptance delays  weather interference or storm damage  unanticipated cost increases  and difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals 
these factors may contribute to cost variations and delays in the delivery of our upgraded and newbuild units and other rigs undergoing shipyard projects 
delays in the delivery of these units would result in delay in contract commencement  resulting in a loss of revenue to us  and may also cause customers to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the rig pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses 
in the event of termination of one of these contracts  we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms  if at all 
our operations also rely on a significant supply of capital and consumable spare parts and equipment to maintain and repair our fleet 
we also rely on the supply of ancillary services  including supply boats and helicopters 
shortages in materials  delays in the delivery of necessary spare parts  equipment or other materials  or the unavailability of ancillary services could negatively impact our future operations and result in increases in rig downtime  and delays in the repair and maintenance of our fleet 
our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events 
certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment 
such payments may not  however  fully compensate us for the loss of the contract 
contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee  under various circumstances such as non performance  as a result of downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues  or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events 
many of these events are beyond our control 
during periods of depressed market conditions such as the current economic downturn  we are subject to an increased risk of our customers seeking to repudiate their contracts  including through claims of non performance 
our customers ability to perform their obligations under their drilling contracts with us may also be negatively impacted by the economic downturn 
if our customers cancel some of our contracts  and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized 
our contract backlog as of february  was approximately billion 
this amount represents the firm term of the contract multiplied by the contractual operating rate  which may be higher than other rates included in the contract such as waiting on weather rate  repair rate or force majeure rate 
our contract backlog includes signed drilling contracts and  in some cases  other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution 
we may not be able to realize the full amount of our contract backlog due to events beyond our control 
in addition  some of our customers have experienced liquidity issues  and these liquidity issues could increase if commodity prices decline to lower levels for an extended period of time 
liquidity issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate  cancel or renegotiate these agreements for various reasons  as described under our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events above 
our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

index our non us operations involve additional risks not associated with our us operations 
we operate in various regions throughout the world  which may expose us to political and other uncertainties  including risks of terrorist acts  war  piracy and civil disturbances  seizure  expropriation or nationalization of equipment  imposition of trade barriers  import export quotas  wage and price controls  unexpected changes in law and regulatory requirements  including changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing laws  damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees  including kidnappings  complications associated with supplying  repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations  and the inability to repatriate income or capital 
we are protected to some extent against loss of capital assets  but generally not loss of revenue  from most of these risks through indemnity provisions in our drilling contracts 
our assets are generally not insured against risk of loss due to perils such as terrorist acts  civil unrest  expropriation  nationalization and acts of war 
many governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these practices may adversely affect our ability to compete 
our non us contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in certain countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to the import and export  equipment and operation of drilling units  currency conversions and repatriation  oil and gas exploration and development  and taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel 
we are also subject to the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac and other us laws and regulations governing our international operations 
in addition  various state and municipal governments  universities and other investors have proposed or adopted divestment and other initiatives regarding investments including  with respect to state governments  by state retirement systems in companies that do business with countries that have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the us state department 
we had a noncontrolling interest in a libyan joint venture that operates to a limited extent in syria  which has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the us state department 
we sold our noncontrolling interest in this joint venture in november our internal compliance program has identified and we have self reported a potential ofac compliance issue involving the shipment of goods by a freight forwarder through iran  a country that has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the us state department 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook regulatory matters 
we also operate a rig in myanmar  a country that is subject to some us trading sanctions 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations  including those relating to sanctions and export restrictions  may subject us to criminal sanctions or civil remedies  including fines  denial of export privileges  injunctions or seizures of assets 
investors could view any potential violations of ofac regulations negatively  which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares 
governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions  the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries 
in addition  government action  including initiatives by opec  may continue to cause oil or gas price volatility 
in some areas of the world  this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil companies and may continue to do so 
a substantial portion of our drilling contracts are partially payable in local currency 
those amounts may exceed our local currency needs  leading to the accumulation of excess local currency  which  in certain instances  may be subject to either temporary blocking or other difficulties converting to us dollars 
excess amounts of local currency may be exposed to the risk of currency exchange losses 
the shipment of goods  services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations 
our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate 
moreover  many countries  including the us  control the import and export of certain goods  services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations 
governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries  persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries  persons and entities  and we are also subject to the us anti boycott law 
the laws and regulations concerning import and export activity  recordkeeping and reporting  import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing 
these laws and regulations may be enacted  amended  enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations 
the adverse impact of the global economic crisis may increase some foreign government s efforts to enact  enforce  amend or interpret laws and regulations as a method to increase revenue 
shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons  some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes 
shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime 
any failure to comply with these applicable legal and regulatory obligations also could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions  such as fines  imprisonment  debarment from government contracts  seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges 

index an inability to obtain visas and work permits for our employees on a timely basis could hurt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 
our ability to operate worldwide depends on our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel to travel in and out of  and to work in  the jurisdictions in which we operate 
governmental actions in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate may make it difficult for us to move our personnel in and out of these jurisdictions by delaying or withholding the approval of these permits 
as a result of a change in government enforcement of the immigration policy in angola  we have recently experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining the necessary visas and work permits for our employees to work in angola  where we operate a number of rigs 
if we are not able to obtain visas and work permits for the employees we need to operate our rigs on a timely basis  we might not be able to perform our obligations under our drilling contracts  which could allow our customers to cancel the contracts 
if our customers cancel some of our contracts  and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  it could adversely effect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act could result in fines  criminal penalties  drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business 
as an international company  we are subject to many laws and regulations  including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
we are currently involved in several investigations by the us department of justice and the sec involving our operations and whether or not we or any of our employees have violated the fcpa 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any current or future investigations  the total costs to be incurred in completing such investigations  the potential impact on personnel  the effect of implementing any further measures that may be necessary to ensure full compliance with applicable laws or to what extent  if at all  we could be subject to fines  sanctions or other penalties which could be material under certain circumstances 
our current investigations include a review of amounts paid to and by customs brokers in connection with the obtaining of permits for the temporary importation of vessels and the clearance of goods and materials 
these permits and clearances are necessary in order for us to operate our vessels in certain jurisdictions 
there is a risk that we may not be able to obtain import permits or renew temporary importation permits in west african countries  including nigeria  in a manner that complies with the fcpa 
as a result  we may not have the means to renew temporary importation permits for rigs located in the relevant jurisdictions as they expire or to send goods and equipment into those jurisdictions  in which event we may be forced to terminate the pending drilling contracts and relocate the rigs or leave the rigs in these countries and risk permanent importation issues  either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  termination of drilling contracts could result in damage claims by customers 
following the completion of existing investigations  we will continue to be subject to the fcpa and these risks 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook regulatory matters 
our labor costs and the operating restrictions under which we operate could increase as a result of collective bargaining negotiations and changes in labor laws and regulations 
some of our employees working in angola  the uk and norway  are represented by  and some of our contracted labor work under  collective bargaining agreements 
many of these represented individuals are working under agreements that are subject to ongoing salary negotiation in these negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses  other increased costs or increased operation restrictions as the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employees not just the union members 
additionally  the unions in the uk sought an interpretation of the application of the working time regulations to the offshore sector 
the employment tribunal issued its decision in favor of the unions and held  in part  that offshore workers are entitled to days of annual leave 
such decision has been overturned on appeal by the employment appeal tribunal  but the unions have appealed this decision of the court of session for a hearing in june the application of the working time regulations to the offshore sector could result in higher labor costs and could undermine our ability to obtain a sufficient number of skilled workers in the uk legislation has been introduced in the uk congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the us  as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed 
additional unionization efforts  if successful  new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions 
our business involves numerous operating hazards 
our operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  punch throughs  craterings  fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms 
in particular  the south china sea  the northwest coast of australia and the gulf of mexico area are subject to typhoons  hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis  and our drilling rigs in these regions may be exposed to damage or total loss by these storms  some of which may not be covered by insurance 
the occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations  damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury to or death of rig personnel 
some experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of these extreme weather conditions 
we are also subject to personal injury and other claims by rig personnel as a result of our drilling operations 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal drilling conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services  or personnel shortages 
in addition  offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
damage to the environment could also result from our operations  particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires 
we may also be subject to property  environmental 
index and other damage claims by oil and gas companies 
our insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses  and we do not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks 
consistent with standard industry practice  our customers generally assume  and indemnify us against  well control and subsurface risks under dayrate contracts 
these are risks associated with the loss of control of a well  such as blowout or cratering  the cost to regain control of or redrill the well and associated pollution 
however  there can be no assurance that these customers will be financially able to indemnify us against all these risks 
we maintain insurance coverage for property damage  occupational injury and illness  and general and marine third party liabilities 
we generally have no coverage for named storms in the us gulf of mexico and war perils worldwide 
also  pollution and environmental risks generally are not totally insurable 
we maintain large self insured deductibles for damage to our offshore drilling equipment and third party liabilities 
we also self insure coverage for expenses to adti and cmi related to well control and redrill liability for well blowouts 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on enterprise value after a loss 
our insurance coverage will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations 
our coverage includes annual aggregate policy limits 
as a result  we retain the risk through self insurance for any losses in excess of these limits 
we generally do not carry insurance for loss of revenue unless contractually required  and certain other claims may also not be reimbursed by insurance carriers 
any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to incur substantial costs 
in addition  we could decide to retain substantially more risk through self insurance in the future 
moreover  no assurance can be made that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks 
as of february   all of the rigs that we owned or operated were covered by existing insurance policies 
regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business 
some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases ghgs and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
in response to such studies  the issue of climate change and the effect of ghg emissions  in particular emissions from fossil fuels  is attracting increasing attention worldwide 
on october   the us environmental protection agency epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large sources in the us beginning in for emissions occurring in in addition  on december   the epa published a final rule finding that current and projected concentrations of six key ghgs in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations 
the epa also found that the combined emissions of these ghgs from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to the ghg pollution that threatens public health and welfare 
this final rule  also known as epa s endangerment finding  does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities directly  however  after the rule s january  effective date  the epa will be able to finalize motor vehicle ghg standards  the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil 
finally  according to the epa  the final motor vehicle ghg standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources 
as a result  the epa has proposed to tailor these programs such that only stationary sources  including refineries that emit over  tons of ghg emissions per year  will be subject to air permitting requirements 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule 
this rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent ghgs to inventory and report their ghg emissions annually on a facility by facility basis 
further  proposed legislation has been introduced in the us congress that would establish an economy wide cap on emissions of ghgs in the us and would require most sources of ghg emissions to obtain ghg emission allowances corresponding to their annual emissions of ghgs 
moreover  in  the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  which establishes a binding set of emission targets for greenhouse gases  became binding on all those countries that had ratified it 
international discussions are currently underway to develop a treaty to replace the kyoto protocol after its expiration in because our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry  existing or future laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements related to ghgs and climate change  including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources  could have a negative impact on our business if such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas 
in addition  such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  which may have a negative impact on our business 
failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations 
we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business worldwide 
over the last few years  competition for the labor required for drilling operations  including for turnkey drilling and drilling management services businesses and construction projects  intensified as the number of rigs activated  added to worldwide fleets or under construction increased  leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward pressure on wages and higher 
index turnover 
we may experience a reduction in the experience level of our personnel as a result of any increased turnover  which could lead to higher downtime and more operating incidents  which in turn could decrease revenues and increase costs 
in response to these historical labor market conditions  we increased efforts in our recruitment  training  development and retention programs as required to meet our anticipated personnel needs 
although we expect current market conditions to slow employee turnover  if increased competition for labor were to intensify in the future we may experience further increases in costs or limits on operations 
we have a substantial amount of debt  and we may lose the ability to obtain future financing and suffer competitive disadvantages 
our overall debt level was billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
this substantial level of debt and other obligations could have significant adverse consequences on our business and future prospects  including the following we may not be able to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other purposes  we may not be able to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt  we could become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  including increases in interest rates  particularly given our substantial indebtedness  some of which bears interest at variable rates  we may not be able to meet financial ratios included in our bank credit agreements due to market conditions or other events beyond our control  which could result in a default under these agreements and trigger cross default provisions in our other debt instruments  less levered competitors could have a competitive advantage because they have lower debt service requirements  and we may be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions than our competitors 
our overall debt level and or market conditions could lead the credit rating agencies to lower our corporate credit ratings below currently expected levels and possibly below investment grade 
our high leverage level and or market conditions could lead the credit rating agencies to downgrade our credit ratings below currently expected levels and possibly to non investment grade levels 
such ratings levels could limit our ability to refinance our existing debt  cause us to issue debt with unfavorable terms and conditions and increase certain fees we pay under our credit facilities 
in addition  such ratings levels could negatively impact current and prospective customers willingness to transact business with us 
suppliers may lower or eliminate the level of credit provided through payment terms when dealing with us thereby increasing the need for higher levels of cash on hand  which would decrease our ability to repay debt balances 
our credit ratings are currently bbb and baa by standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
we are subject to litigation that  if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to a variety of litigation and may be sued in additional cases 
certain of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos or toxic fumes or resulting from other occupational diseases  such as silicosis  and various other medical issues that can remain undiscovered for a considerable amount of time 
some of these subsidiaries that have been put on notice of potential liabilities have no assets 
our patent for dual activity technology has been challenged  and we have been accused of infringing other patents 
other subsidiaries are subject to litigation relating to environmental damage 
we cannot predict the outcome of the cases involving those subsidiaries or the potential costs to resolve them 
insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases  insurers may not remain solvent  and policies may not be located 
suits against non asset owning subsidiaries have and may in the future give rise to alter ego or successor in interest claims against us and our asset owning subsidiaries to the extent a subsidiary is unable to pay a claim or insurance is not available or sufficient to cover the claims 
to the extent that one or more pending or future litigation matters is not resolved in our favor and is not covered by insurance  a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition could result 
public health threats could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial results 
public health threats  such as the hn flu virus  severe acute respiratory syndrome  and other highly communicable diseases  outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate  could adversely impact our operations  the operations of our customers and the global economy  including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for our services 
any quarantine of personnel or inability to access our offices or rigs could adversely affect our operations 
travel restrictions or operational problems in any part of the world in which we operate  or any reduction in the demand for drilling services caused by public health threats in the future  may materially impact operations and adversely affect our financial results 
compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations 
our operations are subject to regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment  requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
for example  as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable us waters and some offshore areas  we may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills or waste disposals related to those operations 
laws and regulations protecting the environment 
index have become more stringent in recent years  and may in some cases impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
the application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have generally been able to obtain some degree of contractual indemnification pursuant to which our customers agree to protect and indemnify us against liability for pollution  well and environmental damages  however  there is no assurance that we can obtain such indemnities in all of our contracts or that  in the event of extensive pollution and environmental damages  our customers will have the financial capability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
also  these indemnities may not be enforceable in all instances 
our ability to operate our rigs in the us gulf of mexico could be restricted by governmental regulation 
hurricanes ivan  katrina and rita in and hurricanes gustav and ike in caused damage to a number of rigs in the us gulf of mexico 
rigs that were moved off location by the storms damaged platforms  pipelines  wellheads and other drilling rigs 
in  the minerals management service of the us department of the interior mms issued interim guidelines requiring that semisubmersibles operating in the us gulf of mexico assess their mooring systems against stricter criteria 
in  additional guidelines were issued which impose stricter criteria  requiring rigs to meet year storm conditions 
although all of our semisubmersibles currently operating in the us gulf of mexico meet the requirements  these guidelines may negatively impact our ability to operate other semisubmersibles in the us gulf of mexico in the future 
moreover  the mms may issue additional regulations that could increase the cost of operations or reduce the area of operations for our rigs in the future  thus reducing their marketability 
implementation of additional mms regulations may subject us to increased costs or limit the operational capabilities of our rigs and could materially and adversely affect our operations in the us gulf of mexico 
acts of terrorism and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services 
acts of terrorism and social unrest  brought about by world political events or otherwise  have caused instability in the world s financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future 
such acts could be directed against companies such as ours 
in addition  acts of terrorism and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for drilling services 
insurance premiums could increase and coverages may be unavailable in the future 
us government regulations may effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries 
these regulations could be amended to cover countries where we currently operate or where we may wish to operate in the future 
other risks a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we operate worldwide through our various subsidiaries 
consequently  we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws  treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate  which could include laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates 
a material change in the tax laws or policies  or their interpretation  of any country in which we have significant operations  or in which we are incorporated or resident  could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results 
tax legislative proposals intending to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies that have legal domiciles outside the us but have certain us connections have repeatedly been introduced in the us congress 
recent examples include  but are not limited to  legislative proposals that would broaden the circumstances in which a non us company would be considered a non us resident and proposals that could override certain tax treaties and limit treaty benefits on certain payments by us subsidiaries to us affiliates 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook tax matters 
us tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company  which could have adverse us federal income tax consequences to us holders 
a foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes if either at least percent of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income or at least percent of the average value of the corporation s assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income 
for purposes of these tests  passive income includes dividends  interest and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties  but does not include income derived from the performance of services 
we believe that we have not been and will not be a pfic with respect to any taxable year 
based upon our operations as described herein  our income from offshore contract drilling services should be treated as services income for purposes of determining whether we are a pfic 
accordingly  we believe that our income from our offshore contract drilling services should not constitute passive income  and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income should not constitute passive assets 

index there is significant legal authority supporting this position  including statutory provisions  legislative history  case law and us internal revenue service irs pronouncements concerning the characterization  for other tax purposes  of income derived from services where a substantial component of such income is attributable to the value of the property or equipment used in connection with providing such services 
it should be noted  however  that a recent case and an irs pronouncement which relies on the recent case characterize income from time chartering of vessels as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes 
however  we believe that the terms of the time charters in the recent case differ in material respects from the terms of our drilling contracts with customers 
no assurance can be given that the irs or a court will accept our position  and there is a risk that the irs or a court could determine that we are a pfic 
if we were to be treated as a pfic for any taxable year  our us shareholders would face adverse us tax consequences 
under the pfic rules  unless a shareholder makes certain elections available under the internal revenue code of  as amended which elections could themselves have adverse consequences for such shareholder  such shareholder would be liable to pay us federal income tax at the highest applicable income tax rates on ordinary income upon the receipt of excess distributions as defined for us tax purposes and upon any gain from the disposition of our shares  plus interest on such amounts  as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder s holding period of our shares 
in addition  under applicable statutory provisions  the preferential percent tax rate on qualified dividend income  which applies to dividends paid to non corporate shareholders prior to  does not apply to dividends paid by a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation is a pfic for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year 
a loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our operating structure  intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we are a swiss corporation that operates through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
consequently  we are subject to tax laws  treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate 
our income taxes are based upon the applicable tax laws and tax rates in effect in the countries in which we operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in these countries 
our income tax returns are subject to review and examination 
we do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority 
if any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure  intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries  or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure  or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country  particularly in the us  norway or brazil  our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected 
for example  there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the us or maintaining a permanent establishment under an applicable treaty  so we cannot be certain that the irs will not contend successfully that we or any of our key subsidiaries were or are engaged in a trade or business in the us or  when applicable  maintained or maintains a permanent establishment in the us if we or any of our key subsidiaries were considered to have been engaged in a trade or business in the us when applicable  through a permanent establishment  we could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of our earnings effectively connected to such us business during the period in which this was considered to have occurred  in which case our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings for that period could increase substantially  and our earnings and cash flows from operations for that period could be adversely affected 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook tax matters 
we may be limited in our use of net operating losses 
our ability to benefit from our deferred tax assets depends on us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our net operating loss nol carryforwards before they expire 
we have established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit for a number of our foreign nol carryforwards  and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our foreign or us deferred tax assets if market conditions change materially and  as a result  our future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly less than we currently estimate 
our nol carryforwards are subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the tax authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols are incurred 
our status as a swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax 
swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval  but this authorization is limited to percent of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years 
additionally  subject to specified exceptions  swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares 
swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions 
in the event we need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares currently swiss francs  equivalent to us 
index based on a foreign exchange rate of swiss francs to on february   we will need to obtain approval of shareholders to decrease the par value of our shares or issue another class of shares with a lower par value 
any reduction in par value would decrease our par value available for future repayment of share capital not subject to swiss withholding tax 
swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions 
for example  dividends must be approved by shareholders 
these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility  and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 
if we are not successful in our efforts to make distributions  if any  through a reduction of par value or  after january   make distributions  if any  out of qualifying additional paid in capital as shown on transocean ltd 
s standalone swiss statutory financial statements  then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of percent 
payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction is not subject to swiss withholding tax 
on february   we announced that our board of directors has decided to recommend that shareholders at our may annual general meeting approve a distribution in the form of a par value reduction denominated in swiss francs for an amount equivalent to approximately us billion  payable in four installments 
however  our shareholders may not approve the proposal  or we may not be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value 
the swiss withholding tax rules could also be changed in the future 
in addition  over the long term  the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions or the amount of qualifying additional paid in capital available for us to pay out as distributions will be limited 
if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or  after january   make a distribution out of qualifying additional paid in capital as shown on transocean ltd 
s standalone swiss statutory financial statements  we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
under present swiss tax law  repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to a percent swiss withholding tax on the difference between the repurchase price and the par value 
at our annual general meeting  our shareholders approved the repurchase of up to billion swiss francs of our registered shares for cancellation the share repurchase program 
on february   our board of directors authorized our management to implement the share repurchase program 
in addition  we announced our intention to list our shares on the six in the second quarter of should we complete the listing of our shares on the six  we may repurchase shares under the share repurchase program via a second trading line on the six from institutional investors who are generally able to receive a full refund of the swiss withholding tax 
alternatively  in relation to the us market  we may repurchase shares under the share repurchase program using an alternative procedure pursuant to which we can repurchase shares under the share repurchase program via a virtual second trading line from market players in particular  banks and institutional investors who are generally entitled to receive a full refund of the swiss withholding tax 
if we complete the listing of our shares on the six  there may not be sufficient liquidity in our shares on the six to repurchase the amount of shares that we would like to repurchase using the second trading line on the six 
in addition  following the listing of our shares on the six our ability to use the virtual second trading line will be limited to the share repurchase program currently approved by our shareholders  and any use of the virtual second trading line with respect to future shares programs will require the approval of the competent swiss tax and other authorities 
we may not be able to repurchase as many shares as we would like to repurchase for purposes of capital reduction on either the virtual second trading line or  in the future  a six second trading line without subjecting the selling shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions 
our articles of association and swiss law contain provisions that could prevent or delay an acquisition of the company by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions may also adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares 
these provisions  among other things classify our board into three classes of directors  each of which serve for staggered three year periods  provide that the board of directors is authorized  at any time during a maximum two year period  to issue a number of shares of up to percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register and to limit or withdraw the preemptive rights of existing shareholders in various circumstances  including following a shareholder or group of shareholders acting in concert having acquired in excess of percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register without having submitted a takeover proposal to shareholders that is recommended by the board of directors or for purposes of the defense of an actual  threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid  in relation to which the board of directors has  upon consultation with an independent financial adviser retained by the board of directors  not recommended acceptance to the shareholders  provide that any shareholder who wishes to propose any business or to nominate a person or persons for election as director at any annual meeting may only do so if advance notice is given to the secretary of transocean  provide that directors can be removed from office only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least percent of the shares entitled to vote  provide that a merger or demerger transaction requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least percent of the shares represented at the meeting and provide for the possibility of a so called cashout or squeezeout merger if the acquirer controls percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting  provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of shares must be taken at a duly called annual or extraordinary general meeting of shareholders  limit the ability of our shareholders to amend or repeal some provisions of our articles of association  and limit transactions between us and an interested shareholder  which is generally defined as a shareholder that  together with its affiliates and associates  beneficially  directly or indirectly  owns percent or more of our shares entitled to vote at a general meeting

item legal proceedings asbestos litigation in  several of our subsidiaries were named  along with numerous other unaffiliated defendants  in complaints filed on behalf of plaintiffs in the circuit courts of the state of mississippi and which claimed injuries arising out of exposure to asbestos allegedly contained in drilling mud during these plaintiffs employment in drilling activities between and a special master  appointed to administer these cases pre trial  subsequently required that each individual plaintiff file a separate lawsuit  and the original multi plaintiff complaints were then dismissed by the circuit courts 
the amended complaints resulted in one of our subsidiaries being named as a direct defendant in seven cases 
we have or may have an indirect interest in an additional cases 
the complaints generally allege that the defendants used or manufactured asbestos containing products in connection with drilling operations and have included allegations of negligence  products liability  strict liability and claims allowed under the jones act and general maritime law 
the plaintiffs generally seek awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages 
in each of these cases  the complaints have named other unaffiliated defendant companies  including companies that allegedly manufactured the drilling related products that contained asbestos 
none of the cases in which one of our subsidiaries is a named defendant has been scheduled for trial in  and the preliminary information available on these claims is not sufficient to determine if there is an identifiable period for alleged exposure to asbestos  whether any asbestos exposure in fact occurred  the vessels potentially involved in the claims  or the basis on which the plaintiffs would support claims that their injuries were related to exposure to asbestos 
however  the initial evidence available would suggest that we would have significant defenses to liability and damages 
in  two cases that were part of the original multi plaintiff suits went to trial in mississippi against unaffiliated defendant companies which allegedly manufactured drilling related products containing asbestos 
we were not a defendant in either of these cases 
one of the cases resulted in a substantial jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff  and this verdict was subsequently vacated by the trial judge on the basis that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof 
while the court s decision is consistent with our general evaluation of the strength of these cases  it has not been reviewed on appeal 
the second case resulted in a verdict completely in favor of the defendants 
there have been no other trials involving any of the parties to the original complaints 
we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously  although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome 
we historically have maintained broad liability insurance  although we are not certain whether insurance will cover the liabilities  if any  arising out of these claims 
based on our evaluation of the exposure to date  we do not expect the liability  if any  resulting from these claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
one of our subsidiaries is involved in lawsuits arising out of the subsidiary s involvement in the design  construction and refurbishment of major industrial complexes 
the operating assets of the subsidiary were sold and its operations discontinued in  and the subsidiary has no remaining assets other than the insurance policies involved in its litigation  fundings from settlements with the primary insurers and funds received from the cancellation of certain insurance policies 
the subsidiary has been named as a defendant  along with numerous other companies  in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos 
as of december   the subsidiary was a defendant in approximately  lawsuits 
some of these lawsuits include multiple plaintiffs and we estimate that there are approximately  plaintiffs in these lawsuits 
for many of these lawsuits  we have not been provided with sufficient information from the plaintiffs to determine whether all or some of the plaintiffs have claims against the subsidiary  the basis of any such claims  or the nature of their alleged injuries 
the first of the asbestos related lawsuits was filed against this subsidiary in through december   the amounts expended to resolve claims including both attorneys fees and expenses  and settlement costs have not been material  and all deductibles with respect to the primary insurance have been satisfied 
the subsidiary continues to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits and we cannot predict the number of additional cases in which it may be named a defendant nor can we predict the potential costs to resolve such additional cases or to resolve the pending cases 
however  the subsidiary has in excess of billion in insurance limits potentially available to the subsidiary 
although not all of the policies may be fully available due to the insolvency of certain insurers  we believe that the subsidiary will have sufficient insurance and funds from the settlements of litigation with insurance carriers available to respond to these claims 
while we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these matters  we do not believe that the current value of the claims where we have been identified will have a material impact on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sedco litigation one of our subsidiaries was involved in an action with respect to a customs matter relating to the sedco semisubmersible drilling rig 
prior to our merger with sedco forex  this drilling rig  which was working for petrobras in brazil at the time  had been admitted into the country on a temporary basis under authority granted to a schlumberger entity 
when the drilling contract with petrobras was transferred from schlumberger to us in the merger  the temporary import permit was not 
index transferred 
when the temporary import permit granted to schlumberger expired in  renewal filings were not immediately made and the brazilian authorities threatened to cancel the temporary import permit and to collect customs duties as if the rig had been nationalized in brazil 
together with schlumberger  we jointly filed an action for the purpose of avoiding cancellation of  and extending  the temporary import permit and to avoid collection of any customs duty 
other proceedings were also initiated to secure the transfer of the temporary import permit to us 
the court initially permitted the transfer of the temporary import permit but did not rule on whether the temporary admission could be extended without the payment of a financial penalty in the form of brazilian customs duties 
in  the brazilian authorities issued an assessment totaling approximately million based on the initial assessment amount  accrued interest and current exchange rate against our subsidiary based on the expiration of the temporary import permit 
this amount continued to grow as a result of interest and changes in the exchange rate 
the first level brazilian court also ruled in that the financial penalties were appropriate and this ruling was subsequently upheld at the next level 
we continued to contest this decision but ultimately decided to participate in november in a brazilian tax amnesty program and paid million to settle all tax claims by the brazilian authorities in this matter 
in addition  we reached a settlement with schlumberger with respect to our allegation that schlumberger should be responsible for the assessment 
rio de janeiro tax assessment in the third quarter of  we received tax assessments of approximately million from the state tax authorities of rio de janeiro in brazil against one of our brazilian subsidiaries for taxes on equipment imported into the state in connection with our operations 
the assessments resulted from a preliminary finding by these authorities that our subsidiary s record keeping practices were deficient 
we currently believe that the substantial majority of these assessments are without merit 
we filed an initial response with the rio de janeiro tax authorities on september  refuting these additional tax assessments 
in september  we received confirmation from the state tax authorities that they believe the additional tax assessments are valid  and as a result  we filed an appeal on september  to the state taxpayer s council contesting these assessments 
while we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these proceedings  we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
patent litigation several of our subsidiaries have been sued by heerema engineering services heerema in the us district court for the southern district of texas for patent infringement  claiming that we infringe their us patent entitled method and device for drilling oil and gas 
heerema claims that our enterprise class  advanced enterprise class  express class and development driller class of drilling rigs operating in the us gulf of mexico infringe on this patent 
they seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief 
the court has held a hearing on construction of their patent but has not yet issued a decision 
we deny liability for patent infringement  believe that their patent is invalid and intend to vigorously defend against the claim 
we do not expect the liability  if any  resulting from this claim to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other matters we are involved in various tax matters as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook tax matters and various regulatory matters as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook regulatory matters 
we are also involved in lawsuits relating to damage claims arising out of hurricanes katrina and rita  all of which are insured and which are not material to us 
in addition  we are involved in a number of other lawsuits  including a dispute for municipal tax payments in brazil and a dispute involving customs procedures in india  neither of which is material to us  and all of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we do not expect the liability  if any  resulting from these other matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any of the litigation matters specifically described above or of any such other pending or threatened litigation 
there can be no assurance that our beliefs or expectations as to the outcome or effect of any lawsuit or other litigation matter will prove correct and the eventual outcome of these matters could materially differ from management s current estimates 
environmental matters we have certain potential liabilities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and similar state acts regulating cleanup of various hazardous waste disposal sites  including those described below 
cercla is intended to expedite the remediation of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
we have been named as a prp in connection with a site located in santa fe springs  california  known as the waste disposal  inc site 
we and other prps have agreed with the us epa and the us department of justice doj to settle our potential liabilities for this site by agreeing to perform the remaining remediation required by the epa 
the form of the agreement is a consent decree  which has been entered by the court 
the parties to the settlement have entered into a participation agreement  which makes us liable for approximately eight percent of the remediation and related costs 
the remediation is complete  and we believe our share of the future operation and maintenance costs of the site is not material 
there are additional potential liabilities related to the site  but these cannot be quantified  and we have no reason at this time to believe that they will be material 

index one of our subsidiaries has been ordered by the california regional water quality control board crwqcb to develop a testing plan for a site known as campus fremont in alhambra  california 
this site was formerly owned and operated by certain of our subsidiaries 
it is presently owned by an unrelated party  which has received an order to test the property 
we have also been advised that one or more of our subsidiaries is likely to be named by the epa as a prp for the san gabriel valley  area  superfund site  which includes this property 
testing has been completed at the property but no contaminants of concern were detected 
in discussions with crwqcb staff we were advised of their intent to issue us a no further action letter but it has not yet been received 
based on the test results  we would contest any potential liability 
we have no knowledge at this time of the potential cost of any remediation  who else will be named as prps  and whether in fact any of our subsidiaries is a responsible party 
the subsidiaries in question do not own any operating assets and have limited ability to respond to any liabilities 
resolutions of other claims by the epa  the involved state agency or prps are at various stages of investigation 
these investigations involve determinations of the actual responsibility attributed to us and the other prps at the site  appropriate investigatory and or remedial actions  and allocation of the costs of such activities among the prps and other site users 
our ultimate financial responsibility in connection with those sites may depend on many factors  including the volume and nature of material  if any  contributed to the site for which we are responsible  the numbers of other prps and their financial viability  and the remediation methods and technology to be used 
it is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential cost of these environmental matters  particularly in respect of remediation obligations 
nevertheless  based upon the information currently available  we believe that our ultimate liability arising from all environmental matters  including the liability for all other related pending legal proceedings  asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted  is adequately accrued and should not have a material effect on our financial position or ongoing results of operations 
estimated costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
contamination litigation on july   one of our subsidiaries was served with a lawsuit filed on behalf of three landowners in louisiana in the th judicial district court for the parish of avoyelles  state of louisiana 
the lawsuit named other defendants  all of which were alleged to have contaminated the plaintiffs property with naturally occurring radioactive material  produced water  drilling fluids  chlorides  hydrocarbons  heavy metals and other contaminants as a result of oil and gas exploration activities 
experts retained by the plaintiffs issued a report suggesting significant contamination in the area operated by the subsidiary and another codefendant  and claimed that over million would be required to properly remediate the contamination 
the experts retained by the defendants conducted their own investigation and concluded that the remediation costs would amount to no more than million 
the plaintiffs and the codefendant threatened to add globalsantafe as a defendant in the lawsuit under the single business enterprise doctrine contained in louisiana law 
the single business enterprise doctrine is similar to corporate veil piercing doctrines 
on august   our subsidiary and its immediate parent company  each of which is an entity that no longer conducts operations or holds assets  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
later that day  the plaintiffs dismissed our subsidiary from the lawsuit 
subsequently  the codefendant filed various motions in the lawsuit and in the delaware bankruptcies attempting to assert alter ego and single business enterprise claims against globalsantafe and two other subsidiaries in the lawsuit 
the efforts to assert alter ego and single business enterprise theory claims against globalsantafe were rejected by the court in avoyelles parish  and the lawsuit against the other defendant went to trial on february  this lawsuit was resolved at trial with a settlement by the codefendant that included a million payment and certain cleanup activities to be conducted by the codefendant 
the codefendant sought to dismiss the bankruptcies 
in addition  the codefendant filed proofs of claim against both our subsidiary and its parent with regard to its claims arising out of the settlement of the lawsuit 
on february   the bankruptcy court denied the codefendant s request to dismiss the bankruptcy case but modified the automatic stay to allow the codefendant to proceed on its claims against the debtors  our subsidiary and its parent  and their insurance companies 
the codefendant subsequently filed suit against the debtors and certain of its insurers in the court of avoyelles parish to determine their liability for the settlement 
the codefendant filed a notice of appeal of the rulings of the bankruptcy court 
globalsantafe and its two subsidiaries also filed notices of appeal to the us district court for the district of delaware 
on january   the codefendant s appeal was granted by the district court and the bankruptcy case was remanded to the bankruptcy court with instructions to have the case dismissed 
on february   the bankruptcy court entered an order dismissing the bankruptcy case 
the debtors  globalsantafe and the two subsidiaries have filed notices of appeal of the district court s ruling with the us court of appeals for the third circuit 
on february   the district court stayed its ruling which instructed the bankruptcy court to dismiss the case 
the appeal was heard on september  on december   the court of appeals affirmed the ruling of the district court 
on january   we petitioned the third circuit for a rehearing of that ruling 
on january   the third circuit declined the petitions for rehearing 

index we believe that these legal theories should not be applied against globalsantafe or these other two subsidiaries  and that in any event the manner in which the parent and its subsidiaries conducted their businesses does not meet the requirements of these theories for imposition of liability 
our subsidiary  its parent and globalsantafe intend to continue to vigorously defend against any action taken in an attempt to impose liability against them under the theories discussed above or otherwise and believe they have good and valid defenses thereto 
we do not believe that these claims will have a material impact on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows
