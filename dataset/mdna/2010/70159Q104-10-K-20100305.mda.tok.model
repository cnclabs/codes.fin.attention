item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview parkway is a self administered and self managed reit specializing in the acquisition  operations  leasing and ownership of office properties 
the company is geographically focused on the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
at january   parkway owned or had an interest in office properties located in states with an aggregate of approximately million square feet of leasable space 
included in the portfolio are properties totaling million square feet that are owned jointly with other investors  representing of the portfolio 
the company s goal is to transform itself from being an owner operator to being an operator owner 
the company will continue executing on this strategy  which highlights the company s strength in providing excellent service in the operation of office properties in addition to its direct ownership of real estate assets 
fee based real estate services are offered through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  parkway realty services llc  which also manages and or leases approximately million square feet for third party owners at january  the company generates revenue primarily by leasing office space to its customers and providing management and leasing services to third party office property owners including joint venture interests 
the primary drivers behind parkway s revenues are occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
occupancy 
parkway s revenues are dependent on the occupancy of its office buildings 
at january   occupancy of parkway s office portfolio was compared to at october  and at january  to combat rising vacancy  parkway utilizes innovative approaches to produce new leases 
these include the broker bill of rights  a short form service agreement and customer advocacy programs which are models in the industry and have helped the company maintain occupancy at a premium above the national occupancy rate of approximately 
parkway currently projects an average annual occupancy range of approximately to during for its office properties 
rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates has the effect of reducing market rental rates and vice versa 
parkway s leases typically have three to seven year terms 
as leases expire  the company replaces the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate 
at january   parkway had per square foot in rental rate embedded loss in its office property leases 
embedded loss is defined as the difference between the weighted average in place cash rents and the weighted average market rental rate 
parkway currently expects embedded rent loss per square foot to increase in customer retention 
keeping existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
parkway estimates that it costs five to six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one than to retain the customer 
in making this estimate  parkway takes into account the sum of revenue lost during downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  parkway focuses a great deal of energy on customer retention 
parkway s operating philosophy is based on the premise that it is in the customer retention business 
parkway seeks to retain its customers by continually focusing on operations at its office properties 
the company believes in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with customers and stockholders 
over the past ten years  parkway maintained an average customer retention rate 
parkway s customer retention for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  lower customer retention in was driven by the loss of customers totaling approximately  square feet due to financial distress and the company s decision to take back approximately  square feet in connection with early lease renewals 
these two factors contributed to the decline in occupancy in and had a negative impact on customer retention for the year

the company used its existing line of credit to pay the million difference on the maturing loan 
the company expects to continue seeking fixed rate  non recourse mortgage financing with maturities from five to ten years typically amortizing over to years on select office building investments as additional capital is needed 
the company monitors the total debt to total asset value ratio as defined in the loan agreements for the million unsecured line of credit 
in addition to the total debt to total asset value ratio  the company monitors interest  fixed charge and modified fixed charge coverage ratios and the debt to ebitda multiple 
the interest coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued to ebitda 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued  principal payments made on mortgage loans and preferred dividends paid to ebitda 
the modified fixed charge coverage ratio is computed by comparing cash interest accrued and preferred dividends paid to ebitda 
the debt to ebitda multiple is computed by comparing parkway s share of total debt to ebitda computed for a trailing month period 
management believes the total debt to total asset value  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage and modified fixed charge coverage ratios and debt to ebitda multiple provide useful information on total debt levels as well as the company s ability to cover interest  principal and or preferred dividend payments with current income 
page of the computation of the company s proportionate share of the interest  fixed charge  modified fixed charge coverage ratios  the debt to ebitda multiple and the reconciliation of net income to ebitda are as follows for the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income loss adjustments to net income loss interest expense amortization of financing costs prepayment expenses early extinguishment of debt depreciation and amortization amortization of share based compensation net gain loss on real estate investments and involuntary conversion tax expense ebitda adjustments unconsolidated joint ventures ebitda adjustments noncontrolling interest in real estate partnerships ebitda interest coverage ratio ebitda interest expense interest expense capitalized interest interest expense unconsolidated joint ventures interest expense noncontrolling interest in real estate partnerships total interest expense interest coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda fixed charges interest expense preferred dividends principal payments excluding early extinguishment of debt principal payments unconsolidated joint ventures principal payments noncontrolling interest in real estate partnerships total fixed charges fixed charge coverage ratio modified fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda modified fixed charges interest expense preferred dividends total fixed charges modified fixed charge coverage ratio debt to ebitda multiple ebitda trailing months parkway s share of total debt mortgage notes payable notes payable to banks adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures adjustments for noncontrolling interest in real estate partnerships parkway s share of total debt debt to ebitda multiple parkway defines ebitda  a non generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measure  as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  losses on early extinguishment of debt and other gains and losses 
ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
page of the company believes that ebitda helps investors and parkway s management analyze the company s ability to service debt and pay cash distributions 
however  the material limitations associated with using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities are that ebitda does not reflect the company s historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures or the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the company s outstanding debt 
although ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  the company compensates for the limitations by only using ebitda to supplement gaap financial measures 
additionally  the company believes that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required gaap measures of its performance and liquidity to improve their understanding of parkway s operating results and liquidity 
parkway views ebitda primarily as a liquidity measure and  as such  the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is cash flows provided by operating activities 
because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap

off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company was invested in four unconsolidated joint ventures with unrelated investors 
these joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  as parkway does not control  but has the ability to significantly influence the operations of the joint ventures and is not the primary beneficiary 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures are not included in parkway s consolidated balance sheet 
information relating to the unconsolidated joint ventures at december  is detailed below

parkway provides management  construction and leasing services for all of the unconsolidated joint ventures except for the wink parkway partnership  and receives market based fees for these services 
the portion of fees earned on unconsolidated joint ventures attributable to parkway s ownership interest is eliminated in consolidation

mbalp is primarily funded with financing from a third party lender  which is secured by a first lien on the rental property of the partnership 
the creditors of mbalp do not have recourse to parkway 
in acting as the general partner  parkway is committed to providing additional funding to partnership deficits up to an aggregate amount of million 
to date parkway has not been required to provide any additional funding to mbalp

critical accounting estimates general 
parkway s investments are generally made in office properties 
therefore  the company is generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or tenants for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc  its majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the company has a controlling interest 
parkway also consolidates subsidiaries where the entity is a variable interest entity and parkway is the primary beneficiary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of the company s significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
parkway considers critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following revenue recognition  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
the cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized under this method and contractual lease payment terms is recorded as straight line rent receivable on the accompanying balance sheets 
when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements  the leased space is ready for its intended use when the tenant improvements are substantially completed 
in limited instances  when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements  straight line rent is recognized when the tenant takes possession of the unimproved space 
page of the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursement of a portion of common area maintenance and other operating expenses 
property operating cost recoveries from customers expense reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
the computation of expense reimbursements is dependent on the provisions of individual customer leases 
most customers make monthly fixed payments of estimated expense reimbursements 
the company makes adjustments  positive or negative  to expense reimbursement income quarterly to adjust the recorded amounts to the company s best estimate of the final property operating costs based on the most recent quarterly budget 
after the end of the calendar year  the company computes each customer s final expense reimbursements and issues a bill or credit for the difference between the actual amount and the amounts billed monthly during the year 
management company income represents market based fees earned from providing management  construction  leasing  brokerage and acquisition services to third parties 
management fee income is computed and recorded monthly in accordance with the terms set forth in the stand alone management service agreements 
leasing and brokerage commissions are recognized pursuant to the terms of the stand alone agreements at the time underlying leases are signed  which is the point at which the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
fees relating to the purchase or sale of property are recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured  which usually occurs at closing 
all fees on company owned properties and consolidated joint ventures are eliminated in consolidation 
the portion of fees earned on unconsolidated joint ventures attributable to parkway s ownership interest is eliminated in consolidation 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
we classify certain assets as held for sale based on management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions to close in the next twelve months 
we consider an office property as held for sale once we have executed a contract for sale  allowed the buyer to complete its due diligence review and received substantial non refundable deposit 
until a buyer has completed its due diligence review of the asset  necessary approvals have been received and substantive conditions to the buyer s obligation to perform have been satisfied  we do not consider a sale to be probable 
when the company identifies an asset as held for sale  we estimate the net realizable value of such asset and discontinue recording depreciation on the asset 
the company records assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
fair value is based on the estimated and realizable contract sales price if available for the asset less estimated costs to sell 
if a sales price is not available  the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset for the remaining useful life are used to determine if the carrying value is recoverable 
the cash flow estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  the company would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
the estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions prove incorrect or if the assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease to net income 
in  parkway recorded non cash other than temporary impairment losses totaling million in connection with the valuation of two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  rubiconpark i  llc and rubiconpark ii  llc 
the impairment is principally due to two customers totaling over  square feet in the office properties that are unable to meet their rent obligations due to financial difficulty 
of the total square footage   square feet has been vacated and another  square feet is expected to be vacated during additionally  on january   the company s joint venture partner  rubicon us reit  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection  rendering our partner unable to support their continuing share of the joint venture obligations 
in  parkway recorded an impairment loss of two contracted office property sales in the amount of million  and an impairment loss on acres of land in new orleans  louisiana in the amount of  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in an increase or decrease in earnings 
page of initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate by allocating the fair value of real estate to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above and below market debt assumed with the acquisition 
parkway allocates the purchase price of properties to tangible and intangible assets based on fair values 
the company determines the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from customers 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our customers ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectability of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our customers  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for customer balances that are over days past due and for specific customer receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense

the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asu  which will become the source of authoritative united states gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
asu brings together in one place all authoritative gaap previously in levels a through d of the gaap hierarchy that has been issued by a standard setter  for example  fasb statements  fasb interpretations  eitf abstracts  fasb staff positions and aicpa accounting and auditing guides 
asu is effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin after september  at december   the company has adopted asu funds from operations management believes that funds from operations available to common shareholders ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the nareit definition of ffo 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments to derive the company s pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures 
further  the company does not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges 
the company believes that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
however  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization  among other items  from net income  as defined by gaap 
the company believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required gaap presentations  has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful 
ffo as reported by parkway may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the company s net income to ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income loss for parkway properties  inc adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations noncontrolling interest depreciation and amortization adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures preferred dividends gain on sale of real estate funds from operations available to common shareholders funds from operations available to common shareholders for the years ended december  and include the following items in thousands year ended december gain on involuntary conversion non cash impairment losses non cash purchase accounting adjustment loss on extinguishment of debt gear up restricted stock expense lease termination fee income page of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
additionally  most of the leases require the customers to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate
