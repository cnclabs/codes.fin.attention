index to financial statements description of noteworthy properties we are the operator of properties containing approximately of our proved oil and gas reserves 
as operator we are able to directly influence exploration  development and production operations 
our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows  subject to commodity price fluctuations  and thus provide a foundation for our technical staff to further develop our existing properties and also generate new projects that we believe have the potential to increase our share value 
we believe that many of our existing fields have additional exploration and exploitation opportunities 
as common in the industry we participate in non operated properties but are selective  our non operating participation decisions are dependent on the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators 
the following is a description of certain of our noteworthy operated and non operated producing oil and gas properties 
bakken shale trend  williston basin our williston basin  bakken trend properties are located in mountrail county and the adjacent counties of north dakota 
as of december   we owned working interests in about  gross acres 
to date  our principal drilling has been conducted through a joint venture with slawson exploration company  but we also participate in this area with several other operators 
we have varying working interests in the properties ranging from to 
through the end of  we have realized a success rate with joint venture wells drilled by the operator 
we also have nominal interests in over wells that are producing or are in various stages of completion with other operators 
our joint venture continues to acquire acreage in this expanding play and is currently running five drilling rigs 
pending economic conditions we expect to continue to run drilling rigs 
the majority of our wells have been and are expected to be drilled on acre spacing units 
in our view  the economics are attractive and acreage can be proved up and placed on production on an expedited basis 
however  we are scheduling  acre and some larger spacing units and have numerous locations which may result in or require larger spacing units 
in addition  consistent with our business strategy of expanding acreage positions with growth  beginning in october  we initiated a significant leasing program in williams county  north dakota with the objective of establishing a significant operated drilling program 
we also solicited industry partners to participate in the project on a promoted basis 
as of march   we have acquired approximately  gross  net acres and entered into agreements with industry partners to participate in future drilling and development activities 
we expect to retain a working interest  amounting to approximately  net acres to the company  in a contractually specified area of mutual interest  with an average net revenue interest 
we are continuing to lease additional acreage in this area 
initial drilling is expected to commence in the summer of for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interest in the bakken trend was approximately boe day and was approximately oil 
riprap coulee field this field is a bakken shale play in eastern montana 
it involves horizontal drilling at vertical depths of about  feet 
currently  we own gross net acres in this prospect 
starbuck madison unit and southwest starbuck madison unit these properties are located in bottineau county  north dakota 
the starbuck madison unit includes  gross  net acres and water flood operations are underway 
this unit includes gross producing wells producing from the mississippian madison interval and six active injection wells 
we operate the unit and have an average working interest of and an average net revenue interest of 
recent production increases are believed to be initial secondary recovery responses 
the flood design includes two productive zones  the midale mississippian charles and the berentson mississippian charles b zone  which are being flooded separately 
the starbuck midale has produced  barrels of oil and the berentson has produced  barrels on primary recovery  for total field production of  barrels of oil 
we also have successfully unitized the southwest starbuck madison unit which includes gross acres 
in this unit  we have a working interest  a net revenue interest and have completed the initial phase of water flood operations in connection with phase two of the larger starbuck madison unit 
for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interest from these two units was approximately boe day and was oil 
production is expected to increase should flood response be successful 
chittim field we have  gross  net acres in this field  located in maverick county  texas 
the field presently produces out of the glen rose interval and the upside potential includes an additional three proved and probable undeveloped locations 
the maverick basin  however  has additional plays and targets including the page

index to financial statements pearsall and eagle ford shale 
we have included in our capital budget one horizontal offset well to a vertical pearsall well that produced 
we believe horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques offer the potential to make the pearsall meaningful to us 
the commercial viability of the eagle ford shale is currently unknown but there is significant activity in the area 
we will monitor the drilling and development efforts of other operators before we commit drilling dollars to development 
our acreage is held by production and therefore  we have no pending lease obligations or expirations 
for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interest in this field was approximately mcfe day and was approximately natural gas 
giddings field our giddings field properties are located in brazos  burleson  fayette  grimes  lee  montgomery and washington counties  texas 
we operate all of these properties  which consist of gross wells that are producing from the cretaceous austin chalk interval 
all of these wells are horizontal producers that initially flow at high rates and subsequently produce through rod pumps  compression  and other production methods 
we have an average direct working interest of and a net revenue interest of in this field 
in grimes county  however  where the majority of our production and development activity is  we have an average direct working interest of and net revenue interest of 
in addition  we are the general partner and hold an interest of in an affiliated limited partnership which owns an average working interest with an average net revenue interest in giddings field 
our acreage position is  net acres  with approximately  net acres held directly and approximately  net acres held through our interest in the limited partnership 
for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interest in giddings field was approximately  mcfe day and was approximately natural gas 
an additional  mcfe day which was approximately gas was attributable to our share of the limited partnership 
the net quantities of oil and gas produced and sold by us in giddings field for each of the three years ended december  the average sales price per unit sold and the average production cost per unit are presented below oil production mbbls gas production mmcf total production mmcfe average sales price net of hedging oil per bbl gas per mcf mcfe production cost per mcfe mcfe have been calculated on the basis of one barrel of oil is equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
in november  we recommenced our successful exploitation of the austin chalk formation in giddings field  in grimes county  texas 
the hutto unit h  which was a planned  foot single lateral location  was spud on november  we are the operator and hold a working interest in this well 
this location and the next two or three planned drilling locations will be on the northwest side of our acreage block where we expect the reserves to be more oily and produce approximately oil and liquids 
through december   we have drilled austin chalk wells and achieved a success rate of 
our present drilling inventory for this field includes proved undeveloped and probable locations 
we continue to acquire additional acreage 
our direct working interest in our inventory of planned drilling location varies from to 
at present  we expect to sequentially drill all locations with a single drilling rig  but we may accelerate development pending continued success and favorable commodity prices

index to financial statements there has been significant exploration activity in regional proximity to our large acreage position in grimes county  texas  including a shallow yegua formation gas discovery  which we believe would be prospective to our acreage and justify a d seismic program 
we believe that the deeper eagle ford shale which underlies the austin chalk may present us with similar opportunities 
the eagle ford shale is being drilled and evaluated by a number of substantially larger independents 
south texas our south texas fields include odem field  located in san patricio county and driscoll field  located in duval county 
productive formations include the frio miocene and jackson yegua intervals 
the fields produce with the aid of rod pumps  gas lift and low pressure gathering systems 
we operate these fields and our working interests in them range from to  our net revenue interests range from to 
for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interest in these fields was approximately boe day oil 
west texas our west texas and new mexico fields include harris field located in gaines county  texas  our mak field  located in andrews county  texas  and other fields located in eddy and lea counties  new mexico

we operate these fields and our working interests in them range from to and our net revenue interests range from to 
for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interests from these properties was approximately boe day and was approximately oil 
eloi bay field complex our eloi bay complex is located in louisiana state waters offshore st 
bernard parish  louisiana in to feet of water 
this non operated complex has gross producing wells 
at present   gross  net acres are held by production 
our working interests in these wells vary between and 
across the complex as a whole  our average working interest is and our average net revenue interest is 
in addition to the proved production  this field has numerous behind pipe opportunities due to multiple stacked sand reservoirs along with four proved undeveloped locations  which are above existing production 
other operators have had drilling success and established deeper production in the area 
we have budgeted funds for the acquisition and reprocessing of d seismic throughout the field and certain surrounding acreage to define prospective opportunities which may exist 
for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interests in the complex was approximately boe day and was approximately oil 
quarantine bay field our quarantine bay field is located in louisiana state waters offshore plaquemines parish  louisiana in to feet of water 
this non operated field has gross producing wells completed above  foot depth 
all of the wells produce with the aid of gas lift equipment 
we have an average working interest in these wells and production facilities of and an average net revenue interest of 
for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interest in this field was approximately boe day and was approximately oil 
while our current share of production is negligible  the production is holding a considerable amount of acreage with exploration potential 
we hold  gross  net acres above  feet and  net acres below that depth 
upside in the shallow reservoirs in this field consists of numerous behind pipe opportunities due to the multiple stacked sand reservoirs  along with proved undeveloped and rate acceleration locations in the depths above  feet 
we believe deeper formations provide exploration potential and we have a working interest  with a net revenue interest below  feet 
the operator acquired square miles of d seismic data to image and define prospect leads primarily below  feet 
schlumberger was engaged to reprocess the d seismic data and provide initial interpretive geological and geophysical services 
geophysical and subsurface evaluation is continuing and several prospects have been defined  the majority of which are on acreage that is held by production operations

index to financial statements title to properties it is customary in the oil and gas industry to make a limited review of title to undeveloped oil and gas leases at the time they are acquired 
it is also customary to obtain more extensive title examinations prior to the commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped leases or prior to the acquisition of producing oil and gas properties 
with respect to the future acquisition of both undeveloped and proved properties  we plan to conduct title examinations on such properties in a manner consistent with industry and banking practices 
we have obtained title opinions  title reports or otherwise conducted title investigations covering substantially all of our producing properties and believe we have satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  overriding royalty interests  and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of such properties

index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto reflected in the index to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
merger change in management  control and business strategy as discussed elsewhere in this report  we underwent a substantial change in ownership  management  voting control  assets and business strategy as a result of the acquisition of southern bay and chandler via the merger and a purchase of working interests in a chandler operated project  which closed in april for financial reporting purposes  the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of georesources  inc by southern bay 
general we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and gas reserves through an active and diversified program which includes purchases of reserves  re engineering  development  and exploration activities 
as further discussed in this report  future growth in assets  earnings  cash flows and share values will be dependent upon our ability to effectively compete for capital and acquire  discover and develop commercial quantities of oil and gas reserves that can be produced at a profit  and assemble an oil and gas reserve base with a market value exceeding its acquisition  development and production costs 
we continue to implement our business strategy to acquire  discover and develop oil and gas reserves and achieve continued growth 
management continues to focus on reducing operating and administrative costs on a per unit basis 
in addition  we have attempted to mitigate downward price volatility by the use of commodity price hedging 
the current volatile price environment for oil and natural gas is significant  and management cannot predict the prices that will be available during the life of our current business plan 
following is a brief outline of our current plans acquire oil and gas properties with significant producing reserves and development and exploration potential  solicit industry partners in acquisitions  on a promoted basis  in order to diversify  reduce average cost and generate operating fees  implement re engineering and development programs within existing fields  pursue exploration projects and increase direct participation in projects over time 
solicit industry partners  on a promoted basis  for internally generated projects  selectively divest assets to upgrade our producing property portfolio and to lower corporate wide per unit operating and administrative costs  and focus on existing fields and new projects with greater development and exploitation potential  continue activities directed toward reducing per unit operating and general and administrative costs on a long term sustained basis  and obtain additional capital through the issuance of equity securities and or through debt financing 
while the impact and success of our corporate plans cannot be predicted with accuracy  our goal is to replace production and further increase our reserve base at an acquisition or finding cost that will yield attractive rates of return 
in addition to our fundamental business strategy  we intend to actively pursue corporate acquisitions and mergers 
management believes that opportunities may become available to acquire corporate entities or otherwise effect business combinations  particularly as a result of the contraction in equity and debt financing markets 
we intend to consider any such opportunities which may become available and are beneficial to stockholders 
the primary financial considerations in the evaluation of any such potential transactions include  but are not limited to the ability of small cap oil and gas companies to gain recognition and favor in the public markets  share appreciation potential  shareholder liquidity  and capital formation and cost of capital to effect growth

index to financial statements recent property acquisitions and divestitures during  we continued to expand our acreage positions  drilling inventory and our drilling programs 
we also acquired producing and undeveloped properties  principally in the bakken shale trend of the williston basin  north dakota and in giddings field  texas 
a summary of this activity is as follows in january  we sold a producing property located in louisiana to an unaffiliated party for million 
we recognized a gain of million in conjunction with this sale 
in may  we acquired producing wells and acreage in the bakken shale trend of the williston basin through an existing joint venture where we participate as a non operator 
we acquired a interest in approximately  net acres  and also acquired of varying working interests in producing and productive wells 
our share of producing wells and undeveloped locations added approximately  boe of proved reserves and numerous prospective locations 
including subsequent leasehold acquisitions  we now have working interests in the joint venture ranging from to in approximately  net acres 
the acquisition cost was approximately million  and was funded with borrowings from our senior secured revolving credit facility 
in may  we acquired certain oil and gas producing properties in giddings field  texas from an affiliated limited partnership for which we serve as the general partner 
prior to the acquisition  we had direct working interests in the properties ranging from about to 
we now hold direct working interests in the producing wells ranging from approximately to 
the acquired direct working interests totaled an estimated bcfe of proved reserves  natural gas and developed  with daily production  at the time of the transaction  totaling  mcf and bbls of associated liquids 
in addition  we increased our partnership interest from to amounting to an estimated bcfe 
we remain the general partner of the partnership and operator of the properties 
the acquisition also provided additional development opportunities and exposure to the potential upside associated with the yegua  georgetown and eagle ford shale formations 
the interests were purchased for a net cash purchase price of million 
in addition  we acquired rights to certain post closing severance tax refunds which amounted to million 
we funded the acquisition with borrowings from our senior secured revolving credit facility 
in august  we received a distribution of proved undeveloped property and unproved acreage in the giddings field from an affiliated partnership 
the property was recorded at an estimated fair market value of million

re engineering and workover 
our re engineering and workover costs decreased by  or  from  in to  in  due to a cost containment strategy during the lower pricing environment of production taxes 
our severance taxes decreased by  or  due to decreased oil and gas revenues as well as to tax exemptions granted by the state of texas for certain high cost drilling wells

hedging activities in an attempt to reduce our sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility and secure favorable debt financing  we have and will likely continue to enter into hedging transactions which may include fixed price swaps  price collars  puts and other derivatives 
we believe our hedging strategy should result in greater predictability of internally generated funds  which in turn can be dedicated to capital development projects and corporate obligations

index to financial statements based on the estimated fair market value of our derivatives  designated as hedges at december   we expect to reclassify net losses on commodity derivatives of million into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income during the next twelve months  however  actual cash settlement gains and losses recognized may differ materially 
at december   a increase in per unit commodity prices would cause the total fair value liability of our commodity derivative financial instruments to increase by to million 
a decrease in per unit commodity prices would cause the fair value liability to change to an asset due to an estimated to million decrease in the net liability 
there would also be a similar increase or decrease in other comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity in the balance sheet 
since we have designated all of our commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges and therefore the change in market value of the effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income  a change in fair value would not have a significant effect on net income 
however  if our hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  our net income for would have decreased by million 
additionally  should commodity prices increase or decrease in the future periods by  our realized settlement gains losses on commodity derivatives  which are included in oil and gas revenues  would increase or decrease by approximately to million in in connection with the borrowing from our bank to fund the october   aroc acquisition  we also entered into a two year interest rate swap contract on million of the debt  designed to protect us against interest rate increases 
during  we extended the term of this interest rate swap through october   and broke the swap up into two pieces  a million swap and a million swap 
we account for the million swap as a cash flow hedge while the million swap is accounted for as a trading security 
the value of these swaps at december  was a liability of  all of which is classified as a current liability 
the value of these swaps at december   was  of which  is classified as a current liability

based on the estimated fair market value of our derivatives designated as hedges at december   we expect to reclassify net losses on our million interest rate swap derivative of million into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income during the next twelve months  however  actual cash settlements may differ materially 
we do not engage in speculative commodity trading activities and do not hedge all available or anticipated quantities of our production 
in implementing our hedging strategy we seek to effectively manage cash flow to minimize price volatility and generate internal funds available for capital development projects and additional acquisitions  ensure our ability to support our exploration activities as well as administrative and debt service obligation  and allow certain quantities to float  particularly in months with historically increased price potential 
we believe that commodity speculation and commodity trading activities are inappropriate for us  but also that management of realized prices is a necessary part of our strategy 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires complex calculations  including the use of a discounted cash flow technique  estimates of risk and volatility  and subjective judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the calculations use future market commodity prices which  although posted for trading purposes  are merely the market consensus of forecasted price trends 
the results of the fair value calculation cannot be expected to represent exactly the fair value of our commodity hedges 
we currently obtain fair value positions from our counterparties and compare that value to our internally calculated value 
we believe that our practice of comparing our value to that of our counterparties  who are more specialized and knowledgeable in preparing these complex calculations  reduces our risk of error and approximates the fair value of the contracts  as the fair value obtained from our counterparties would be the cost to us to terminate a contract at that point in time

index to financial statements capital budget we continue to expand our portfolio of drilling and development projects and therefore have recently increased our projected drilling and development expenditures 
as of december   we have identified approximately million of diversified exploration and development projects  which are summarized in the table below 
from this list of identified projects  we currently have budgeted capital expenditures of to million for and while the table includes the bulk of our currently identified projects  we are constantly working on developing and acquiring new opportunities 
in addition  seismic and acreage expenditures as well as drilling results will likely lead to modifications of our estimates 
a benefit of our portfolio is that it includes both gas and oil opportunities  much of which are held by production and therefore not subject to lease expiration or significant future incremental carrying costs 
accordingly  we have some ability to adjust our capital spending as our financial position and industry circumstances dictate 
generally  we are committed to limiting our capital spending to our cash flow  although in certain limited circumstances  we may utilize our borrowing capacity for development or lease saving operations 
we do not intend to use our borrowing capacity for exploratory drilling 
we may  however  shift our expenditures between geographic areas and projects such as development versus exploration in an attempt to maximize cash flow and take advantage of regional differences in net commodity prices and service costs 
furthermore  our budget may be accelerated or deferred  pending commodity prices  drilling and service rig availability and cost  and adequate staffing to effectively manage activities and control costs 
while financial conditions and industry circumstances may require us to make adjustments  it is our current intent to continue our bakken and austin chalk drilling programs and certain other projects in the gulf coast  west texas and the williston basin 
generally  management undertakes a complete budget review in the spring of each year  but modifies the budget and actual expenditures throughout the year as deemed appropriate 
the projects  estimated costs and timing of actual expenditures are subject to significant change as we continue to technically and economically evaluate existing and alternative projects  as we further expand our portfolio  and as industry conditions dictate 
estimated expenditures are also subject to significant change 
there can be no assurance that all of the projects identified and summarized in the table below will remain viable and therefore certain projects may be sold or abandoned by us 
however  in the opinion of management  at present  we have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to fulfill lease obligations or otherwise maintain all material mineral leases

index to financial statements for further information on the effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncements  refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations 
under this method  costs to acquire oil and gas properties  drill successful exploratory wells  drill and equip development wells  and install production facilities are capitalized 
exploration costs  including unsuccessful exploratory wells  geological  geophysical as well as cost of carrying and retaining unproved properties are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of the capitalized costs associated with proved oil and gas properties are computed using the units of production method  at the field level  based on total proved reserves and proved developed reserves  respectively  as estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group 
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  generally on a field by field basis 
long lived assets committed by management for disposal are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell 
all of our properties are located within the continental united states and the gulf of mexico 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion  impairment of our oil and natural gas properties  and asset retirement obligations 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserve quantities and future cash flows included in this report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and the fasb 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 
our proved reserves information included in this report is based on estimates prepared by our independent petroleum engineers  cawley  gillespie associates  inc the independent petroleum engineers evaluated of our estimated proved reserve quantities and their related future net cash flows as of december  estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ substantially from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
we make revisions to reserve estimates throughout the year as additional information becomes available 
we make changes to depletion rates  impairment calculations  and asset retirement obligations in the same period that changes to reserve estimates are made 
page 
table of contents 
index to financial statements depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves  which estimates incorporate various assumptions and future projections 
if the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
impairment of oil and gas properties we review the value of our oil and gas properties whenever management judges that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable 
impairments of producing properties are determined by comparing the pretax future net undiscounted cash flows to the net book value at the end of each period 
if the net capitalized cost exceeds undiscounted future cash flows  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined based on expected future cash flows using discounted rates commensurate with the risks involved  using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal decision making 
different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment 
we provide for impairments on significant undeveloped properties when we determine that the property will not be developed or a permanent impairment in value has occurred 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligations aros consist primarily of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells  removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage  and land restoration in accordance with applicable local  state and federal laws 
the discounted fair value of an aro liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a over the life of the oil and gas field 
derivative instruments and hedging activity we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we use hedging to help ensure that we have adequate cash flows to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based  in part  on our view of current and future market conditions 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
we primarily utilize swaps and costless collars  which are placed with major financial institutions 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivative contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the fair value gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective and is reclassified to gain page

index to financial statements loss on oil and natural gas hedging activities line item in our consolidated statements of income in the period that the hedged production is delivered 
hedge effectiveness is measured quarterly based on the relative changes in the fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
our costless collars are valued based on the counterparty s marked to market statements  which are validated by observable transactions for the same or similar commodity options using the nymex futures index 
our swaps are valued based on a discounted future cash flow model 
our primary input for the model is the nymex futures index 
our model is validated by the counterparty s marked to market statements 
the discount rate used in determining the fair values of these instruments includes a measure of nonperformance risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations each period can be impacted by our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our derivative contracts would not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment  then our consolidated statements of income could include large non cash fluctuations  particularly in volatile pricing environments  as our contracts are marked to their period end market values 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
we evaluate the ability of our counterparties to perform at the inception of a hedging relationship and on a periodic basis as appropriate 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
we will consider a tax position settled if the taxing authority has completed its examination  we do not plan to appeal  and it is remote that the taxing authority would reexamine the tax position in the future 
we use the benefit recognition model which contains a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criteria and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  then we will not record the tax benefit 
the amount of interest expense that we recognize related to uncertain tax positions is computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be

index to financial statements revenue recognition we predominantly derive our revenue from the sale of produced oil and gas 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received 
historically  however  differences have been insignificant 
accounting for business combinations our business has grown substantially through acquisitions  and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations to date using the purchase method 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests acquired are measured at their fair value including the recognition of acquisition related costs and anticipated restructuring costs that are separate from the acquired net assets 
the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
certain contingent assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if we can reasonably estimate a fair value during the measurement period 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities  and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available

index to financial statements effects of inflation and pricing we experienced increased costs during and due to increased demand for oil field products and services 
in  these all time high prices for services decreased somewhat 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry put significant pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
conversely  in a period of declining prices  associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion 
material changes in prices also impact our current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans  impairment assessments of oil and gas properties  and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
impact of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions the operations of and use of the products produced by the natural gas and oil industry are sources of emissions of certain greenhouse gases ghg s  namely carbon dioxide and methane 
regulation of ghg emissions has not had an impact on our operations in the past  and the regulation of our ghg emissions as such has not occurred 
however  there is a trend towards government imposed limitation of ghg emissions at the state  regional  and federal level 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  by virtue of a recent supreme court decision  was deemed to have authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other ghg emissions under the clean air act  and they are drafting and preparing to implement regulations 
it is possible that legislation will be proposed to amend the clean air act to exclude ghg s  but we believe the probability of the enactment of such legislation is uncertain 
in addition  in there was a significant effort in the united states congress to enact legislation to establish a cap and trade system as a means to regulate ghg emissions 
a cap and trade bill was approved by the house of representatives  but it appears uncertain that similar legislation will pass in the senate 
therefore  it appears that the probability of enactment of a cap and trade bill in may be relatively low at this time  but is fairly unpredictable 
because of the uncertainty of the nature of any potential future federal ghg regulations at this time  we are unable to forecast how future regulation of ghg emissions would negatively impact our operations 
we will continue to monitor regulatory developments and to assess our ability to reasonably predict the economic impact of these developments on our business 
the commercial risk associated with the exploration and production of fossil fuels lies in the uncertainty of government imposed climate change legislation  including cap and trade schemes  and regulations that may affect our customers  which could affect the demand for crude oil and natural gas 
such an impact on demand could have an adverse impact on the demand for our services  and could have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
on the other hand  natural gas produces less greenhouse gas emissions when burned than other fossil fuels  such as refined petroleum products or coal 
as a result  climate change legislation could create an increased demand for natural gas 
to what extent climate change may result in an increase in extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes  thunderstorms  tornados and snow and ice storms  as well as rising sea levels is uncertain 
extreme weather conditions could increase our costs and damages resulting from extreme weather  for which we may not be fully insured 
however  to what extent climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards or affect our operations  is difficult to determine at this time 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  financing partnerships or guarantees
