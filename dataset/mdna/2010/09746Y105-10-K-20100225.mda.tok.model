we consume chemicals in the manufacturing of our packaging segment products 
important chemicals we use include pulping and bleaching chemicals such as caustic  starch  sulfuric acid  and sodium chlorate 
during the year ended december   chemical costs accounted for approximately of materials  labor  and other operating expenses in this segment 
many of our chemicals are purchased under long term contracts  which provide more stability than open market purchases 
however  many of these contracts are negotiated at the end of each year at prevailing rates 
higher prevailing rates may result in increases to overall chemical costs 

table of contents sales  marketing  and distribution our containerboard linerboard and corrugated containers and sheets are sold by our own sales personnel or brokers 
abitibi consolidated sales corporation acsc purchased all of our newsprint production until late february  when we terminated the arrangement with acsc 
since that time  we have sold newsprint through our own sales personnel 
the following table sets forth sales volumes of containerboard linerboard and newsprint in thousands of short tons and corrugated containers and sheets in millions of square feet for the periods indicated boise inc predecessor year ended december  year ended december  january through february  year ended december containerboard linerboard newsprint corrugated containers and sheets customers during the year ended december   approximately of our linerboard volume was sold in the open market  both domestically and internationally 
the remaining volume was used in our operations 
we sell our finished corrugated containers to over  active customers  including large agricultural producers and food and beverage processors 
we sell corrugated sheets to over converters  who use the sheets to manufacture corrugated containers for a variety of customers 
we have a focused position in the agricultural and food markets for corrugated boxes 
we service these less cyclical end markets with our five strategically located corrugated container plants  one sheet feeder plant  and one sheet plant 
with our regional focus and footprint  we are able to service our customers needs from multiple plants  schedule operating runs to maximize productivity  and reduce waste and better utilize different paper roll sizes 
we believe this position in favorable end markets has contributed to increases in our profitability and has made us more resistant to economic downturns 
we sell to newspaper publishers located in regional markets near our deridder  louisiana  manufacturing facility and to export markets primarily in south america 
corporate and other our corporate and other segment includes primarily corporate support services  related assets and liabilities  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
during the predecessor periods presented  the corporate and other segment included primarily an allocation of boise cascade corporate support services and related assets and liabilities 
these support services included  but were not limited to  finance  accounting  legal  information technology  and human resource functions 
this segment also includes transportation assets  such as rail cars and trucks  which we use to transport our products from our manufacturing sites 
rail cars and trucks are generally leased 
we provide transportation services not only to our own facilities but also  on a limited basis  to third parties when geographic proximity and logistics are favorable 
during the year ended december   segment sales related primarily to our rail and truck business were million 
during the year ended december   and the predecessor period of january through february   and for the year ended december   these sales were million  million  and million  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a services agreement under which we provide a number of corporate staff services to boise cascade at our cost 
these services include 
table of contents information technology  accounting  and human resource services 
the initial term of the agreement is for three years and will expire on february  it will automatically renew for one year terms unless either party provides notice of termination to the other party at least months in advance of the applicable term

competition the markets in which we operate are large and highly competitive 
our products and services compete with similar products manufactured and distributed by others both domestically and globally 
many factors influence our competitive position in each of our operating segments 
those factors include price  service  quality  product selection  and convenience of location as well as our manufacturing and overhead costs 
some of our competitors in each of our segments are larger than we are and have greater financial resources 
these resources afford those competitors greater purchasing power  increased financial flexibility  and more capital resources for expansion and improvement  which may enable those competitors to compete more effectively than we can 
paper 
the markets in which our paper segment competes are large and highly competitive 
commodity grades of uncoated freesheet are globally traded  with numerous worldwide manufacturers  and as a result  these products compete primarily on the basis of price 
all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states  and although we compete largely in the domestic market  we do face competition from foreign producers  some of which have lower operating costs than we do 
the level of this competition varies  depending on domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates 
in general  paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas  except in highly specialized or custom grades 
the north american uncoated freesheet producers shipped million short tons in and has four major manufacturers that account for approximately of capacity  according to resource information systems inc risi and our estimates 
as of december   we believe 
table of contents that we are the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet paper in north america 
our competitors include domtar corporation the largest producer  international paper  and georgia pacific llc 
although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades  quality and service are important competitive determinants  especially in premium and specialty grades 
our uncoated freesheet papers compete with electronic data transmission  document storage alternatives  and paper grades we do not produce 
increasing shifts to these alternatives and increasing use of the internet have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage 
these secular trends are in addition to the current demand decline driven by a weak economy and reduced white collar employment 
major uncoated freesheet producers  including boise inc  have responded to declining demand by closing or significantly curtailing capacity to match lower demand 
in december  we permanently restructured our mill in st 
helens  oregon  by permanently closing the pulp mill and two of our three paper machines at that facility 
during  we elected to take economic downtime and slowed production on selected machines to balance production with demand 
we may continue to take additional downtime or slow production if market conditions warrant 
packaging 
the north american containerboard corrugating medium and linerboard manufacturers produced million short tons in  and five major manufacturers account for approximately of capacity  according to risi and our estimates 
our largest competitors include international paper company  smurfit stone container corporation  georgia pacific llc  temple inland  inc  and packaging corporation of america 
containerboard corrugating medium and linerboard and newsprint are globally traded commodities with numerous worldwide manufacturers 
these products compete primarily on the basis of price 
the intensity of competition in these industries fluctuates based on demand and supply levels as well as prevailing foreign currency exchange rates 
our corrugated container operations in the pacific northwest have a leading regional market position and compete with several national and regional manufacturers 
our plant in waco  texas  known as central texas corrugated  or ctc  produces corrugated sheets that are sold to sheet plants in the southwest  where they are converted into corrugated containers for a variety of customers 
some of our competitors have lower operating costs and or enjoy greater integration between their containerboard production and corrugated container production than we do 
the north american newsprint producers shipped million metric tonnes a metric tonne is equal to  pounds in and has three major manufacturers that account for approximately of capacity  according to risi and our estimates 
our largest competitors include abitibibowater inc  white birch paper  and kruger 
in april  abitibibowater inc  north america s largest maker of newsprint  sought bankruptcy protection in the us and canada 
demand for newsprint has declined dramatically in the last several years and may continue to decline as electronic media replaces newspapers 
major producers have closed capacity and taken downtime  including abitibibowater  which announced in december a total of approximately  metric tonnes of permanent and temporary curtailments for in april  we announced that we had indefinitely idled the d newsprint machine at our mill in deridder  louisiana 
depending on demand and our ability to sell newsprint through our own sales personnel  we may be required to take economic downtime or slow production on our newsprint machine to balance production with demand  as market conditions warrant

seasonality our businesses experience some seasonality  based primarily on buying patterns associated with particular products 
for example  the demand for our corrugated containers is influenced by changes in agricultural demand in the pacific northwest 
in addition  seasonally cold weather increases costs  especially energy consumption  at all of our manufacturing facilities 
seasonality also affects working capital levels as described below 
working capital working capital levels fluctuate throughout the year and are affected by seasonality  maintenance shutdowns  and changing sales patterns 
typically  we build working capital in our paper segment at the end of the fourth quarter as we build finished goods inventory in preparation for first quarter sales 
finished goods inventories are also increased prior to scheduled annual maintenance shutdowns to maintain sales volumes while production is stopped 
inventories for some raw materials  such as fiber  exhibit seasonal swings as we increase log and chip inventories to ensure ample supply of fiber to our mills throughout the winter 
in our packaging segment  agricultural demand influences working capital as finished good inventory levels are increased in preparation for the harvest season in third and fourth quarters 
changes in sales volumes can affect accounts receivable levels in both our paper and packaging segments  influencing overall working capital levels 
we believe our management practices with respect to working capital conform to common business practices in the us acquisitions and divestitures we may engage in acquisition and divestiture discussions with other companies and make acquisitions and divestitures from time to time 
we review our operations and dispose of assets that fail to meet our criteria for return on investment or cease to warrant retention for other reasons

item a 
risk factors in addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this form k particularly in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in our other filings with the sec  the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forward looking statement 
we cannot guarantee that our actual results will be consistent with the forward looking statements we make in this report  and we do not assume an obligation to update any forward looking statement 
adverse business and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial position 
general economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods  employment levels  the availability and cost of credit  and ultimately  the profitability of our business 
high unemployment rates  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment  and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products 
these conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
risks related to industry conditions the paper industry experiences cyclicality  changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
historically  macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity have created cyclical changes in 
table of contents prices  sales volumes  and margins for our products 
changing industry conditions can influence paper and packaging producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to continue to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which could prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply in these markets can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable short term pricing trends 
industry supply is also influenced by overseas production capacity  which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow 
a weak us dollar tends to mitigate the levels of imports  while a strong us dollar tends to increase imports of commodity paper products from overseas  putting downward pressure on prices 
prices for all of our products are driven by many factors outside our control  and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our commodity products  and as a result  the price for any one or more of these products may fall below our cash production costs  requiring us to either incur short term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities 
from time to time  we have taken downtime or slowed production at some of our mills to balance our production with the market demand for our products  and we may continue to do so in the future 
some of our competitors may also close or reduce production at their operating facilities  some of which could reopen and increase production capacity 
this potential supply and demand imbalance could cause prices to fall 
therefore  our ability to achieve acceptable operating performance and margins is principally dependent on managing our cost structure  managing changes in raw materials prices which represent a large component of our operating costs and fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control  and general conditions in the paper market 
if the prices for our products decline or if our raw material costs increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
some of our paper products are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 
our uncoated freesheet papers and newsprint compete with electronic data transmission  document storage alternatives  and paper grades we do not produce 
increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage 
neither the timing nor the extent of this shift can be predicted with certainty 
because of these trends  demand for paper products may shift from one grade of paper to another or be eliminated altogether 
we face strong competition in our markets 
the paper and packaging and newsprint industries are highly competitive 
we face competition from numerous competitors  domestic as well as foreign 
some of our competitors are large  vertically integrated companies that have greater financial and other resources  greater manufacturing economies of scale  greater energy self sufficiency  or lower operating costs  compared with our company 
we may be unable to compete with other companies in the market during the various stages of the business cycle and particularly during any downturns 
some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors including foreign producers into the markets we serve  our competitors pricing strategies  our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences  and our inability to maintain the cost efficiency of our facilities 
increases in the cost of our raw materials  including wood fiber  chemicals  and energy could affect our profitability 
we rely heavily on raw materials  including wood fiber and chemicals  and energy sources  including natural gas and electricity 
our profitability has been  and will continue to be  affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials 
for most of our products  the relationship between industry supply and demand  rather than changes in the cost of raw materials  determines our ability to increase prices 
consequently  we may be unable to pass 
table of contents increases in our operating costs on to our customers in the short term 
any sustained increase in raw material costs  coupled with our inability to increase prices  would reduce our operating margins and potentially require us to limit or cease operations of one or more of our machines or facilities 
wood fiber is our principal raw material  accounting for approximately and  respectively  of the aggregate amount of materials  labor  and other operating expenses  including fiber costs  for our paper and packaging segments for the year ended december  wood fiber is a commodity  and prices have historically been cyclical 
in addition  wood fiber  including wood chips  sawdust  and shavings  is a byproduct in the manufacture of building products  and the availability of wood fiber is often negatively affected if demand for building products declines 
severe or sustained shortages of fiber could cause us to curtail our own operations  resulting in material and adverse effects on our sales and profitability 
future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands  the protection of endangered species  and forest health can also affect log and fiber supply 
energy accounts for approximately and  respectively  of the aggregate amount of materials  labor  and other operating expenses  including fiber costs  for our paper and packaging segments for the year ended december  energy prices  particularly for electricity  natural gas  and fuel oil  have been volatile in recent years 
these fluctuations affect our manufacturing costs and can contribute significantly to earnings volatility 
other raw materials we use include various chemical compounds  such as starch  caustic soda  precipitated calcium carbonate  sodium chlorate  and dyes 
purchases of chemicals accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the aggregate amount of materials  labor  and other operating expenses  including fiber costs  for our paper and packaging segments for the year ended december  the costs of these chemicals have been volatile historically and are influenced by capacity utilization  energy prices  and other factors beyond our control 
risks related to our operations we depend on officemax for a significant portion of our business 
our largest customer  officemax  accounted for approximately of our total sales for the year ended december  in october  officemax agreed to purchase  from our predecessor  its full north american requirements for cut size office paper  to the extent boise chooses to supply such paper to them  through december if this contract is not renewed or not renewed on terms similar to the existing terms  our future business operations may be adversely affected 
if officemax were unable to pay  our financial performance could be affected significantly and negatively 
any significant deterioration in the financial condition of officemax or a significant change in its business that would affect its willingness to continue to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales  or negatively affect our net income 
any of our manufacturing facilities  or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including the following maintenance outages 
prolonged power failures 
equipment failure 
disruption in the supply of raw materials  such as wood fiber  energy  or chemicals 
a chemical spill or release 
closure because of environmental related concerns 

table of contents explosion of a boiler 
the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on our water supply 
disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railroad tracks  and tunnels 
fires  floods  earthquakes  hurricanes  or other catastrophes 
terrorism or threats of terrorism 
labor difficulties 
other operational problems 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if our machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime  our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired  resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our financial results 
labor disruptions or increased labor costs could materially adversely affect our business 
while we believe we have good labor relations  we could experience a material labor disruption  strike  or significantly increased labor costs at one or more of our facilities  either in the course of negotiations of a labor agreement or otherwise 
either of these situations could prevent us from meeting customer demands or result in increased costs  thereby reducing our sales and profitability 
as of january   we had approximately  employees 
approximately of these employees work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements 
as of january   approximately of our employees were working pursuant to collective bargaining agreements that have expired or will expire within one year  including agreements at the following facility locations wallula  washington  deridder  louisiana  jackson  alabama  st 
helens  oregon  and nampa  idaho 
the labor contract at our paper mill in wallula  washington employees represented by the awppw expired in march and was terminated by the awppw on october  in early february  the union employees at wallula rejected a new collective bargaining agreement that union leadership had recommended unanimously 
on february   the company declared an impasse in the bargaining process and implemented the terms of the last contract offer 
our potential inability to reach a mutually acceptable labor contract at wallula  or at any of our other facilities  could result in  among other things  strikes or other work stoppages or slowdowns by the affected employees 
while the company has in place contingency plans to address labor disturbances  we could experience disruption to our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
future labor agreements could increase our costs of healthcare  retirement benefits  wages  and other employee benefits 
additionally  labor issues that affect our suppliers could also have a material adverse effect on us if those issues interfere with our ability to obtain raw materials on a cost effective and timely basis 
we are subject to significant environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  and the cost of compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operation 
we are subject to a wide range of general and industry specific environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we may face civil or criminal fines  penalties  or enforcement actions  including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment  or other remedial actions 
we anticipate that governmental regulation of our operations will continue to become more burdensome and that we will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures in order to maintain compliance with applicable laws 
for example  we may be affected if laws concerning 
table of contents climate change are enacted that regulate greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
such laws may require buying allowances for mill ghg emissions or capital expenditures to reduce ghg emissions 
because environmental regulations are not consistent worldwide  our capital and operating expenditures for environmental compliance may adversely affect our ability to compete 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures for environmental compliance were million 
we expect to spend approximately million on environmental items in enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant additional expenditures 
we may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could materially affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may seek to acquire other businesses  products  or assets 
however  we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates  and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms  if at all 
if we do complete acquisitions  we may not strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals 
acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day responsibilities  increase our expenses  and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage the integration of acquired businesses effectively or be able to retain and motivate key personnel from those businesses 
any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks related to economic and financial factors we have substantial indebtedness  and our ability to repay our debt is dependent on our ability to generate cash from operations 
as of december   our total indebtedness was million 
our ability to repay our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from future operations 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that are beyond our control 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  to obtain additional debt  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our operations require substantial capital  and we may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of our capital requirements 
our businesses are capital intensive  and we regularly incur capital expenditures to maintain our equipment  increase our operating efficiency  and comply with environmental laws 
in addition  significant amounts of capital are required to modify our equipment to produce alternative or additional products or to make significant improvements in the characteristics of our current products 
during the year ended december   our total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million 
we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures for we currently expect our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  to be between million and million annually over the next five years 
if we require funds for operating needs and capital expenditures beyond those generated from operations  we may not be able to obtain them on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  our debt service obligations will reduce our available cash flows 
if we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as necessary for our continued operations or as needed to ensure environmental compliance  we could be required to cease or curtail some of our manufacturing operations  or we may become unable to manufacture products that can compete effectively in one or more of our markets 

table of contents our indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us  and a default under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our credit facilities require bz intermediate holdings llc holdings and its subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial tests 
these tests include  in the case of our credit facilities  an interest coverage ratio test  a first lien secured leverage ratio test  and a total leverage ratio test 
in addition  our credit facilities restrict  and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict  among other things  the ability of holdings and its subsidiaries to create additional liens on assets  make investments or acquisitions  pay dividends  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  including capital stock of subsidiaries  make capital expenditures  place restrictions on the ability of such subsidiaries to make distributions  enter into transactions with our affiliates  enter into new lines of business  and engage in consolidations  mergers  or sales of substantially all of our assets 
we will need to seek permission from the lenders under our indebtedness to engage in specified corporate actions 
the lenders interests may be different from our interests  and no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the lenders permission when needed 
various risks  uncertainties  and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants 
failure to comply with these covenants or similar covenants contained in future financing agreements could result in a default under the credit facilities  the indenture governing the senior notes  and other agreements containing cross default provisions  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
a default would permit lenders or holders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements  to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt  and to terminate any commitments to lend 
under these circumstances  we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations  including the obligations of boise paper holdings  llc  and boise finance company under the senior notes 
in addition  the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing 
we anticipate significant future funding obligations for pension benefits 
in december  we enacted a freeze on our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees the salaried plan  however  we continue to maintain defined benefit pension plans for most of our union employees 
despite the freeze of the salaried plan  we will continue to have significant obligations for pension benefits
