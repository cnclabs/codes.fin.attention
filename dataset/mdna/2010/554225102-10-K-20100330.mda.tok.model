overview macatawa bank corporation is a michigan corporation and a registered holding company 
it wholly owns macatawa bank  macatawa statutory trust i and macatawa statutory trust ii 
macatawa bank is a michigan chartered bank with depository accounts insured by the fdic 
the bank operates twenty six branch offices and a lending and operational service facility  providing a full range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services in kent county  ottawa county  and northern allegan county  michigan 
macatawa statutory trusts i and ii are grantor trusts and issued million each of pooled trust preferred securities 
these trusts are not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
for further information regarding consolidation  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effective june   the operations of macatawa bank mortgage company were consolidated with and into macatawa bank  and the mortgage company was subsequently dissolved and liquidated 
all products and services previously provided by the mortgage company are now provided by macatawa bank 
the reorganization is intended to enhance earnings through reduced operating expenses as a result of efficiencies gained 
prior to june   macatawa bank mortgage company was a wholly owned subsidiary of macatawa bank that primarily originated and sold residential mortgage loans into the secondary market on a servicing released basis 
at december   macatawa had total assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and shareholders equity of million 
the weak local and national economic conditions that have persisted over the past few years have contributed to the million and million of operating losses reported by macatawa during and the losses for each year were largely attributable to loan losses  lost interest on non performing assets and rising costs of administering problem assets associated with the rapid increase in problem loans and other real estate assets 
the results for also included a non cash charge of million included in federal income tax expense associated with a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the results for included non cash  after tax impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets of million 
there will be no further affect on the company s results of operations associated with deferred tax assets or goodwill  as these assets have been written off in their entirety 
as of the date of this report  the bank was categorized as adequately capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines 
as a result of our losses  the board of directors of macatawa has significantly changed the strategic direction and focus of the bank to improve its internal operations and to work out of its problem loans and assets 
the macatawa bank board of directors has implemented additional corporate governance practices and disciplined business and banking principles including more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards 
the focus of our management team has turned from growth in our business to executing these disciplined business and banking procedures and policies designed to limit future losses  preserve capital and improve operational efficiencies 
these steps have already resulted in the removal of approximately million from the company s annualized operating costs 
macatawa has also worked closely with its regulators at the frb and macatawa bank s regulators at the fdic and the ofir to put in place improved controls and procedures 
on february   macatawa bank entered into a consent order with the fdic and ofir  the primary banking regulators of the bank 
additional information further describing changes in the company s business  including those in response to its recent losses and to the consent order  are described in detail in item of this report under the heading recent business developments 
results of operations summary net loss available to common shares was million or loss per common share for compared to net loss of million or loss per common share for and net income of million or per common share for the results for included the following a non cash charge of million included in federal income tax expense associated with a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  a million charge associated with the settlement of the trade partners lawsuit  and a  industry wide special fdic assessment 
the results for included a non cash  after tax impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets of million 
these items are discussed more fully below 
the remaining decline in earnings for and compared to was largely from an increase in costs associated with problem loans and non performing assets 
the provision for loan losses was million and million for and compared to million for costs associated with nonperforming assets were million  million and million for  and lost interest from rising balances of non performing assets was approximately million  million and million for  and each of these items is discussed more fully below 
more information regarding the steps designed to limit future losses including complying with the requirements of the consent order may be found below in this item of the report under the headings noninterest expense and loan portfolio and asset quality  and in item of this report under the heading recent business developments 
net interest income net interest income totaled million during compared to million during and million during the decrease in net interest income during compared to was due to both a million decrease in average earning assets and a basis point decline in net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets ie net interest margin or margin 
as is customary in the banking industry  interest income on tax exempt securities is adjusted in the computation of the yield on tax exempt securities and net interest margin using a tax rate to report these items on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
average interest earning assets decreased from billion to billion from a focus on reducing credit exposure within certain segments throughout  liquidity improvement and capital preservation 
the net interest margin declined to for from for lost interest from higher balances of non performing assets resulted in approximately basis points of the decline 
a million increase in average non interest checking accounts partially offset this decline 
despite the annual decline in the net interest margin and pressure from higher balances of non performing assets  the margin steadily improved during  from in the first quarter to in the second quarter to in the third quarter to in the fourth quarter 
the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to for from for the decline was from a decrease in the yield on our variable rate loan portfolio  an increase in the balance of lower yielding liquid investments and higher balances of non accrual loans 
the basis point decline in the prime rate that occurred during caused a decrease in the yield on our variable rate loan portfolio and was the primary reason for the decline in the yield on earning assets 
higher balances of nonperforming loans in compared to resulted in a decline of approximately basis points in the yield on assets 
the decline was also impacted by an increase in lower yielding short term investments 
the company has chosen to hold excess investable funds in these lower yielding short term investments to improve its balance sheet liquidity during the current economic downturn 
the cost of funds decreased basis points to in from in a decrease in the rates paid on our deposit accounts in response to declining market rates and the rollover of time deposits and other borrowings at lower rates within the lower rate environment were the primary reasons for the decrease in the cost of funds 
the decrease in net interest income during compared to was due to a basis point decline in the net interest margin partially offset by a million increase in average earning assets 
the net interest margin decreased to for from for approximately half of the decline in margin was from rising balances of non performing assets throughout the remaining decline was largely driven by the federal funds and prime rate cuts that began in  resulting in a more rapid decline in the yield on assets compared to the cost of funds 
the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to for from for the basis point decline in the prime rate that began in the third quarter of and continued throughout caused a decrease in the yield on our variable rate loan portfolio and was the primary reason for the decrease in yield on earning assets 
the impact of rising balances of non performing loans during the period resulted in approximately basis points of the decline 
the cost of funds decreased basis points to in from in from a decrease in rates paid on deposits and the rollover of time deposits and other borrowings at lower rates within the declining rate environment during the period 
the level of earning assets is expected to continue to decline in the near term due to the persistent weak economic conditions in michigan 
further  in response to the losses incurred by the company and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  management remains focused on reducing asset balances  including earning assets  in order to maintain or improve capital ratios 
due to our being categorized as adequately capitalized under regulatory standards  we are not able to accept  renew or roll over any brokered deposits unless we apply for and are granted a waiver from this prohibition from the fdic 
the continued decline in the level of earning assets is expected to have a negative impact on net interest income in a continued decline in the cost of funds  primarily from the repricing of term funding at lower costs  is  however  expected to offset the impact of lower earning asset levels and have a positive impact on net interest income in the following table shows an analysis of net interest margin for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost assets taxable securities tax exempt securities loans federal home loan bank stock federal funds sold and other short term investments total interest earning assets noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks other total assets liabilities and shareholders equity deposits interest bearing demand savings and money market accounts time deposits borrowings other borrowed funds long term debt subordinated debt federal funds purchased total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing demand accounts other noninterest bearing liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income net interest spread net interest margin ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities yields are presented on a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate

the increases in the provision for loan losses for over and over were the result of an increase in net charge offs during each year and additional reserves considered necessary for a general deterioration in the quality of outstanding loans at each period end 
net charge offs were million in  million in and million in the higher charge offs each year were mostly associated with significant declines in the value of collateral securing collateral dependent  real estate loans primarily for residential land development 
in response to these elevated loan losses and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  macatawa bank s board of directors has increased the governance over the lending function and  working directly with the management team  has taken tangible steps to reduce the bank s exposure within certain credit concentrations  establish more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards and implement new lending and compliance procedures and policies and new problem loan identification and resolution plans 
more information regarding these steps may be found in item of this report under the heading recent business developments and in this item of the report under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality 
the ultimate amount of the loan loss provision in all periods is a byproduct of establishing our allowance for loan losses at levels believed to be adequate under our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance 
more information about our allowance for loan losses and our methodology for establishing its level may be found in this item of the report under the heading allowance for loan losses below 
noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in compared to million in and million in noninterest income for included approximately  and  of gains on the sale of securities and gains on the settlement of interest rate swaps  reflecting transactions that accomplished a shift to a more balanced sensitivity to interest rate changes 
revenue from deposit services decreased  to million in compared to million in and million in the decline was related to a decrease in non sufficient fund fees  consistent with a decline across the entire banking industry 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue from other deposit services due to continued growth in core checking accounts and expansion of services to business customers 
the increase in primarily reflected an expansion of our deposit customer account base 
gains on sales of loans include gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
we sell the majority of the fixed rate mortgage loans we originate 
we do not retain the servicing rights for the loans we sell 
a summary of gain on sales of loans and related volume was as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december gain on sales of loans real estate mortgage loans originated for sale real estate mortgage loans sold net gain on the sale of real estate mortgage loans as a percent of real estate mortgage loans sold loan sales margin gains on sales of loans increased million to million in from million in and the decline in mortgage rates that began in the first quarter of led to a significant increase in refinancing 
this favorable rate environment for mortgage refinancing and the company s focus on shrinking its loan portfolio and preserving capital  are the primary reasons for the increase in loans originated for sale and the resulting increase in gains on sales of loans in the increase due to volume was slightly offset by a decline in the loan sales margin 
during and  mortgage interest rate levels generally increased  which led to a lower level of residential refinancing and new loan originations during these periods 
the company also chose to hold more of its mortgage loan volume in its portfolio during these periods 
mortgage interest rate levels have stabilized since early and resulted in a slower pace of refinancing activity during the latter half of in addition  the weak economic conditions that have persisted throughout have resulted in a lower level of new loan originations and more stringent underwriting requirements in the secondary market 
we expect these conditions to continue to result in a slower pace of mortgage loan activity as we enter  which would lead to lower gains on sales of loans 
trust service revenue declined  to million in due to both a challenging market for account growth and retention and volatility in equity market valuations 
revenues from trust services decreased  or to million in from million in general declines in customer stock portfolio values associated with the significant decline in the stock market during were the primary reason for the decrease in trust income in the consent order may impact how the company is perceived in the marketplace  resulting in challenges to retain trust customers and maintain current levels of trust revenue in atm and debit card processing income increased  in to million compared to million in and million in the increase reflected a continued increase in usage from current customers and overall growth in the number of debit and atm card customers 
promotional efforts to increase volume in these low cost transaction alternatives continued to be successful 
other income was million in compared to million in and million in the amount for included a  gain on the termination of certain borrowings and the amount for included a  unrealized gain on the company s interest rate swaps  both associated with the company s overall management of interest rate risk 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million for compared to million for and million for noninterest expense for included a million charge associated with the settlement of the trade partners lawsuit 
noninterest expense for included a non recurring impairment charge of million for goodwill and an impairment charge of million for intangible assets 
each of these items is discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
costs associated with nonperforming assets increased million in to million compared to million in and million in these costs included legal costs  repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense and losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties 
repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense included survey and appraisal  property maintenance and management and other disposition and carrying costs 
losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties included both net losses on the sale of properties and subsequent reductions from value declines for outstanding properties 
costs associated with nonperforming assets are itemized in the following table in thousands legal and professional repossessed and foreclosed property administration losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties total in response to the elevated problem asset levels  the related costs to administer these assets and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  the board of directors and management have taken tangible steps to reduce problem asset levels 
these steps are discussed further in item of this report under the heading recent business developments and in this item under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality below 
because of these additional steps and as problems loans move through the collection process  we expect these costs associated with nonperforming assets to remain elevated during beyond  however  we expect these steps to ultimately stabilize and reduce costs associated with administering nonperforming assets 
fdic assessments increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase for included an industry wide special assessment of  the remaining increase in fdic assessments was from higher assessment rates implemented by the fdic in late  including additional risk based assessments applicable to the company 
the company expects its fdic assessments for to remain elevated as a result of these higher assessment rates 
further discussion regarding the determination of fdic assessments for macatawa bank may be found in item of this report under the heading supervision and regulation 
when excluding the trade partners litigation settlement charge in  the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in and the nonperforming asset costs and fdic assessments for each year  other non interest expense items would have been approximately million in  down from million in and down from million in although we have removed the nonperforming asset costs and fdic assessments noted above to allow for comparison of the company s remaining other non interest expense items  we expect these costs and assessments to continue as discussed in the previous two paragraphs 
the company continues to aggressively manage costs in all controllable areas of non interest expense to offset the increases driven by higher nonperforming asset levels 
salaries and benefit expense decreased million  or  to million from million in largely due to staff reductions and a curtailment of bonuses and wage increases in response to the deteriorating economic conditions 
the staff reductions were primarily in product sales positions as the company continued to scale its business to a more appropriate level within the current environment 
staff reductions in the loan origination function are discussed more fully below under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality 
salaries and benefit expense are expected to continue to decline in from the staff reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of and from the elimination or reduction in certain employee benefits 
merit increases have again been suspended for salaries and benefit expense increased million in from million in primarily due to staff additions and merit increases 
staff additions occurred primarily in the first half of the year in varied positions throughout the company  including risk management  credit administration and problem asset departments  and selective sales personnel to support growth in deposits and commercial and industrial lending 
during the second half of  salary and benefit levels began to experience a decline primarily from staff reduction initiatives in certain operational and sales functions and the elimination or outsourcing of certain backroom functions associated with expense reduction initiatives 
occupancy expense declined  in after an increase of  in furniture and equipment expense was down  in after an increase of  in marketing and data processing expenses both declined slightly in and other expense was down million in and down  in the stabilization in and the declines in within these expense areas were the direct result of initiatives to reduce controllable costs  including the curtailment of certain growth activities as a result of the difficult economic conditions that have impacted the company s results 
in addition to eliminating or outsourcing certain backroom functions  these initiatives included restructuring third party contracts  acceleration of electronic delivery for certain customers and trimming controllable costs 
legal and professional fees decreased  in after an increase of million in the increase in primarily related to invoices received over time in connection with the trade partners litigation which were expected to be paid by the company s insurance carrier  but were since deemed unreimbursable 
the trade partners litigation was settled during resulting in the decline in legal and professional fees during the trade partners litigation is further discussed in item of this report in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects efficiency  excluding fdic assessments and the additional costs necessary to manage non performing assets  to continue to improve in as a result of the expense reduction initiatives that occurred in federal income tax expense benefit the company recorded a federal income tax benefit of million and million in and and federal income tax expense of million in a million tax benefit in  primarily associated with the million loss before income taxes  was offset by the need to establish an million valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the reason for the valuation allowance is described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred tax assets are realized or the valuation allowance is no longer required 
the realization of the company s deferred tax assets is largely dependent upon its ability to generate future taxable income 
during the fourth quarter of  a tax law change extended the carry back of and net operating losses to five years from the previous two year carry back period 
as a result the company recorded an million favorable tax benefit that reduced the company s net operating loss for this carry back extension is only available to financial institutions  such as macatawa  that did not receive capital under the us treasury s troubled asset relief program tarp 
this change will allow the company to carry back and recover the full tax benefit of its net operating loss 
accordingly  the company had no net operating loss carryforward as of december  the million tax benefit in was primarily associated with the million loss before income taxes  exclusive of the million non taxable impairment charge for goodwill 
the million federal income tax expense in was primarily associated with the million income before income taxes 
the income tax benefit or expense for each year differs from the amount computed by applying our statutory federal income tax rate of to our pre tax earnings primarily due to tax exempt interest income and income from bank owned life insurance  and the non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million in financial condition summary total assets were billion at december   a decrease of million from billion at december  the decrease in total assets was largely from a decline of million in the company s loan portfolio from efforts to reduce concentration in certain loan types and improve on balance sheet liquidity 
part of the decline in the loan portfolio was from million of net loan charge offs primarily associated with valuation declines on collateral dependent real estate loans 
a million decline in investment securities also contributed to the decline in total assets 
the reduction in assets since december  allowed the company to reduce wholesale funding  including out of market deposits from brokers by million  and higher costing deposits 
total deposits were billion at december   down million  from billion at december  in addition to the decline in brokered deposits  local jumbo time deposits were down million 
total shareholders equity declined by million primarily from the net loss recorded for as a result of our losses and the resulting decline in shareholders equity of the company  the bank s regulatory capital ratios fell below levels required to be categorized as well capitalized 
as of the date of this report  the bank was categorized as adequately capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines 
in addition  because the bank is subject to the consent order  the bank cannot be categorized as well capitalized  regardless of actual capital levels 
as a result  the bank cannot accept  renew or rollover any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the fdic 
in order to meet the requirements of the consent order and the limitations associated with the bank being categorized as adequately capitalized  the board of directors and management of the company are committed to continuing to reduce our loan portfolio and brokered deposit levels to maintain or improve our capital ratios 
cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents  which include federal funds sold and short term investments  were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was from liquid money market investments held in large  money center banks to improve the liquidity of the balance sheet during this period of economic slowdown 
the company expects to maintain these higher balances until conditions improve and more attractive investment opportunities emerge 
securities securities decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to calls and maturities of government agency bonds  partially offset by purchases of us government agency bonds 
the additional cash flow generated from this decline has been used primarily to support a reduction in wholesale funding and increase liquid money market investments as discussed above 
as conditions improve  the company expects to reinvest excess liquidity and selectively build its investment portfolio to diversify its balance sheet 
we desire to maintain our securities portfolio at a level to provide diversity in the level of credit risk within our asset base  to support our liquidity needs and to balance our interest rate risk 
our portfolio consists primarily of high quality u 
s government agency and state and local municipal bonds classified as available for sale 
these securities are generally purchased at fixed rates to help offset the interest sensitivity of our variable rate loan portfolio 
the company has not experienced any credit losses within its investment portfolio 
loan portfolio and asset quality in response to the losses incurred by the company and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  our board of directors has increased the governance over the lending function and has taken tangible steps to reduce its loan portfolio  including its exposure within certain credit concentrations 
more discussion regarding these steps may be found in item of this report under the heading recent business developments 
in order to comply with the requirements of the consent order  we expect to continue to shrink our loan portfolio in our total loan portfolio decreased million to billion at december  from billion at december  during  residential mortgage loans decreased by million  consumer loans decreased million  commercial and industrial loans decreased million and commercial real estate loans declined million 
our residential mortgage loan portfolio  which also includes residential construction loans made to individual homeowners  comprised approximately and of portfolio loans at the end of and  respectively 
our residential real estate portfolio represents only a portion of our residential origination loan volume  as we sell a large portion of our fixed rate residential mortgages on the secondary market with servicing released 
while we have seen a decline in our residential mortgage portfolio  the volume of activity in this segment remained relatively strong during much of the decline in the residential mortgage portfolio was from customers refinancing and our subsequent sale of these loans in the secondary market 
the company s focus on shrinking its loan portfolio and preserving capital are the primary reasons for the increase in loans originated for sale in mortgage loans originated for sale were million in compared to million in and million in mortgage interest rates declined in the first half of  as the government responded to weak economic conditions through efforts to stimulate the residential home market 
accordingly  the company experienced a significant increase in refinancing activity 
as refinancing activity slowed and underwriting in the secondary markets became more stringent  volumes generally declined over the remainder of we expect these conditions to co ntinue to result in a slower pace of mortgage loan origination and sales activity during our consumer loan portfolio includes loans secured by personal property and home equity fixed term and line of credit loans 
our consumer loan portfolio decreased to million at december  from million at december  consumer loans comprised approximately and of our portfolio loans at the end of and the decline in the commercial loan portfolio during reflected the continuing weak economic conditions in west michigan  efforts to reduce our exposure within certain credit concentrations and our focus on improving the quality of our loan portfolio 
in particular  deterioration in residential land development has continued to impact both asset growth and asset quality 
the company focused its efforts throughout on reducing its exposure to residential land development loans  diversifying its commercial loan portfolio and improving asset quality 
the company expects continued shrinkage in in its real estate portfolios to maintain or improve our capital ratios and comply with the consent order 
total commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans were billion at december  and billion at december  this portfolio remains our largest loan segment and accounted for approximately of the total loan portfolio at both december  and our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are made up of loans to small and mid sized business 
our commercial and industrial loan portfolio decreased by million to million at december  and represented of our commercial portfolio 
the decrease was primarily from a general decline in business activity 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio declined by million  primarily in construction and land development loans  due to charge offs and substantial effort to reduce exposure in these segments 
a further breakdown of the composition of the commercial loan portfolio is shown in the table below in thousands december  december  construction and land development nonfarm  nonresidential farmland and agriculture multi family total commercial real estate loans commercial and industrial total commercial loans of the decline in commercial real estate  million was from loans to residential developers  the portfolio that has caused the majority of stress within the company s loan portfolio 
loans to residential developers involved in the development or sale of family residential properties were approximately million and million at december  and as the company enters  it remains focused on efforts to continue to reduce the commercial loan portfolio in order to improve its asset quality  reduce concentrations in certain loan types  maintain or improve our capital ratios and comply with the consent order 
initiatives intended to achieve these results are described in more detail in item of this report under the heading recent business developments and include the following 
downsized the loan origination team  including termination of loan officers whose loan portfolios included a majority of the company s non performing assets 
curtailed the origination of residential land development loans  the portfolio primarily responsible for loan losses in and established goals for the reduction of credit concentrations in the broader commercial real estate portfolio and implemented reporting requirements for accountability 
established individual lender scorecards which are monitored on an ongoing basis 
lenders are apprised monthly of these targets scorecards and held accountable 
when reasonable doubt exists concerning collectibility of interest or principal of one of our loans  that loan is considered impaired and placed in nonaccrual status 
any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings 
nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans  foreclosed assets and repossessed assets 
nonperforming loans include loans on non accrual status and loans delinquent more than days but still accruing 
foreclosed and repossessed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans 
nonperforming loans as of december  totaled million or of total portfolio loans compared to million or of total portfolio loans at december  nonperforming loans at the end of and were primarily on nonaccrual and were considered to be either well collateralized or adequately reserved 
nonperforming loans for the development or sale of family residential properties were approximately million or of total non performing loans at december  compared to million or of total non performing loans at december  the remaining balance of non performing loans at december  consisted of million of commercial real estate loans secured by non residential real estate  million of commercial and industrial loans  and million of consumer and residential mortgage loans 
foreclosed assets totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was the result of the migration of non performing loans secured by real estate into foreclosed assets through the foreclosure process 
of the million  there were commercial real estate properties totaling million 
the remaining balance was comprised of residential real estate properties totaling million 
all properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure are initially transferred at their fair value less costs to sell and then evaluated for impairment after transfer using a lower of cost or market approach 
proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties were million  million and million for  and total nonperforming assets amounted to million or of total assets at december  compared to million or as of december  the following table shows the composition and amount of our nonperforming assets

interest is being accrued on these loans under their restructured terms as they are less than days past due 
loans rated a or worse per the company s internal risk rating system are considered substandard  doubtful or loss 
additional information regarding the company s internal rating system is included in this item under the heading allowance for loan losses below 
loans classified as substandard or worse were as follows at year end dollars in thousands loans less than  loans greater than  not classified as impaired classified as impaired total loans classified substandard or worse loans classified substandard or worse as a percent of total loans at december   approximately million of the million of loans classified as substandard or worse were on nonaccrual status while the remaining million of these loans were on accrual status 
additional information regarding the company s impaired loans may be found in item of this report under the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and is here incorporated by reference 
the levels of nonperforming assets and loans classified as substandard or worse remained elevated throughout as the persistently weak economic conditions continued to impact many of the company s commercial loan customers 
the company s residential developer customers continued to be the segment impacted most severely 
the local economy remains weak as evidenced by elevated unemployment levels 
these conditions are expected to continue to put pressure on loan customers 
accordingly  we expect an increase in the balance of foreclosed assets and a continued elevated level of nonperforming loans in in response to the elevated levels of nonperforming assets and loans classified substandard or worse  and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  our board of directors has taken the following steps intended to stabilize and ultimately reduce the bank s problem asset levels 
realigned departments in the lending function 
the special asset group responsible for the disposition of problem assets and the credit administration department responsible for loan policy and credit monitoring are led by recently appointed senior officers who now report directly to the audit committee 
the risk management department also reports directly to the audit committee 
the risk management department is now administratively responsible for the loan review function and is in process of expanding this team with senior loan review specialists to support its goal of completing an independent  annual review of the entire commercial loan portfolio 
as discussed above  certain loan officers were terminated whose loan portfolios included a majority of the company s non performing assets 
curtailed the origination of residential land development loans  the portfolio primarily responsible for loan losses in and in addition the special assets group has set specific objectives and targets for the reduction in nonperforming asset levels 
to accomplish these reductions  the special assets group is pursuing various strategies 
these strategies include the use of troubled debt restructures for viable businesses  attachment of additional collateral where possible  active communication and workout plans with loan customers under stress and accelerated disposition strategies for certain loan types and foreclosed assets 
although these activities are designed to stabilize and ultimately reduce our substandard loans  impaired loans and nonperforming asset levels  there can be no assurance that these levels will decline in allowance for loan losses determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective 
as loan losses escalated over and and the pace of credit deterioration increased  we have had to continually re evaluate and refine our approach to determining the allowance for loan losses 
timely identification of risk rating changes within the commercial loan portfolio is key to our process of establishing an appropriate allowance balance 
the internal risk rating systems is discussed below 
to accomplish effective risk rating  additional efforts took place in the latter half of our special assets group reviewed all credits rated a or worse under our internal risk rating system 
accelerated downgrading of credits took place as a result of this review 
although we are comfortable with risk rating results as of december   additional measures are being taken in to further enhance the risk rating system 
beginning in early  our loan review function now reports functionally to the audit committee 
the risk management department is now responsible administratively for the loan review function and is in process of expanding this team to include a senior loan review manager and additional resources 
under our new framework  all commercial loan risk ratings are to be independently evaluated by our internal loan review function upon origination or renewal 
in addition  all commercial loans are to be independently reviewed by our internal loan review function at least annually to monitor the accuracy and completeness of the watch list and all risk ratings 
also  we have now moved to a monthly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses versus the quarterly approach previously used 
these actions are intended to further strengthen our process for establishing  in a timely fashion  the amount of the allowance for loan losses that management believes to be appropriate in light of changes in the c ondition of our loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses at december  was million  or of total portfolio loans  compared to million or of total portfolio loans at december  the following is a summary of our portfolio loan balances and changes in the allowance for loan losses and related ratios 
dollars in thousands december portfolio loans average daily balance of loans for the year amount of loans outstanding at end of period allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year addition to allowance charged to operations loans charged off real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial and industrial total commercial residential mortgage consumer recoveries real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial and industrial total commercial residential mortgage consumer net charge offs balance at end of year ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at year end allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans at year end net charge offs totaled million or of average loans for compared to million or of average loans for and million  or of average loans for the majority of the net charge offs in each year were largely associated with impaired real estate loans  which migrated to loss as persistent deterioration in the economy and resulting significant declines in the value of collateral securing these loans occurred throughout these years 
the majority of the charge offs in and were loans associated with residential land development 
for these loans  cash flow to service the debt is primarily expected from sales of lots and properties securing these loans  which has declined markedly throughout and this significant deterioration in cash flows and resulting expected future cash flows is the primary reason for the declines in the value of the real estate securing these loans 
our allowance for loan losses was maintained at a level considered appropriate based upon our quarterly assessment of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of allowance and related provision for loan losses relies on several key elements  which include specific allowances for loans considered impaired  formula allowance for commercial loans based upon applying the company s loan rating system  and general allocations based on historical trends for homogeneous loan groups with similar risk characteristics 
specific allowances are established on individually impaired credits where we believe it is probable that a loss may be incurred 
the formula allowance allocated to commercial loans that are not considered to be impaired is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk rating of such loans 
we use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system 
loans rated a or better are considered of acceptable risk 
loans rated a exhibit above normal risk to the company and warrant a greater level of attention by management 
these loans are subject to on going review and assessment by the company s administrative loan committee 
loans rated a or worse are considered substandard  doubtful or loss  exhibit a greater relative risk of loss to the company based upon the rating and warrant an active workout plan administered by the company s special asset group  as discussed above 
loans are assigned a loss allocation factor for each loan classification category based principally on the loss history for each risk rating within each loan category 
commercial real estate loans are stratified and grouped by the type of real estate securing such loans for determining the loan classification category 
the loss history is based upon the latest month period  as this period is considered most representative within the current economic cycle 
the loss allocation factor is adjusted for consideration of significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the analysis date 
the worse the grade assigned to a loan category  the greater the allocation percentage that is applied 
the qualitative factors assessed and used to adjust historical loss experience are our best assessment of the impact economic trends  delinquency and other problem loan trends  trends in valuations supporting underlying collateral  changes in loan portfolio concentrations and changes in internal credit administration practices have on probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
qualitative adjustments are inherently subjective and there can be no assurance that these adjustments have properly identified probable losses in our loan portfolio 
more information regarding the subjectivity involved in determining the estimate of the allowance for loan losses may be found in this item of the report under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates 
groups of homogeneous loans  such as residential real estate  open and closed end consumer loans  etc  receive general allowance allocations based on a review of loss trends by specific loan segments 
these loss allocations are then adjusted based upon past due status  and consideration for general economic and business conditions  collateral values  seasoning of the portfolios and most recent loss experience for similar pools of loans 
the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type at the dates indicated 
as of december dollars in thousands allowance amount of each category to total loans allowance amount of each category to total loans allowance amount of each category to total loans commercial and commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer total the components of the allowance for loan losses associated were as follows as of december dollars in thousands balance of loans allowance amount balance of loans allowance amount commercial and commercial real estate specific reserves on impaired loans formula allowance on non impaired loans residential mortgage and consumer reserves on residential mortgage troubled debt restructurings general allowance allocations total of the million of impaired commercial loans  million were classified as substandard or worse per the company s internal risk rating system 
the million of residential mortgage troubled debt restructurings were associated with new programs approved by the us government during to minimize the number of consumer foreclosures 
these loans involved the restructuring of terms on consumer mortgages to allow customers to mitigate foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow 
the company has been active at utilizing these programs and working with its customers to reduce the risk of foreclosure 
additional information regarding impaired loans at december  and may be found in item of this report in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in the level of the allowance for was primarily related to an increase in reserves associated with commercial loans 
the increase of million in reserves on commercial loans was primarily related to a million increase in the formula allowance on non impaired loans 
the increase in the historical loss experience incurred by the company during this period and a general deterioration in the credit quality from a decline in the overall risk ratings of commercial loans is the primary reason for this increase 
the general allowance for residential real estate and consumer loans was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was largely related to a decline in the balance of consumer loans and a slight decline in the past due status of these loans 
of the million allowance at december   related to specific allocations on impaired loans  related to the formula allowance on commercial loans and related to general allocations for homogeneous loans 
the above allocations are not intended to imply limitations on usage of the allowance 
the entire allowance is available for any loan losses without regard to loan type 
more information regarding steps to address the elevated levels of substandard  impaired and nonperforming loans  which have largely resulted in the need to increase the allowance for loan losses  may be found in item of this report under the heading recent business developments and this item of the report under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality above 
although the company believes its allowance for loan losses has captured the losses that are probable in its portfolio as of december   there can be no assurance that all losses have been identified or that the allowance is sufficient 
the additional efforts by management to accelerate the identification and disposition of problem assets discussed above  and the impact of the lasting economic slowdown may result in additional losses in premises and equipment premises and equipment totaled million at december   representing a decrease of million from million at december  the decline was largely from depreciation of current facilities in excess of capital additions during because the company has slowed its overall asset growth amidst the weak economic conditions in west michigan  it has suspended its branch expansion initiatives 
accordingly  there were no new facilities constructed during when economic conditions and financial performance improve  the company will assess the prospects for future branch expansion 
deposits total deposits decreased million to billion at december   as compared to billion at december  because of the decline in assets during  the company decreased some of its higher costing deposits 
the decline in deposits was primarily from a million decrease in out of market deposits generated from brokers and an million decrease in local jumbo time deposits 
the remainder of the decline was from a million decrease in institutional money market accounts related to planned distributions by these customers 
a maturity table of deposits issued through brokers may be found in item of this report in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the overall declines in deposit categories noted above were partially offset by growth in balances of personal and business checking and savings accounts 
these increases are particularly noteworthy considering the lack of economic expansion in western michigan and the intense competition for core deposit growth in the company s markets 
the company believes its growth in balances of personal and business checking and savings accounts was primarily attributable to its focus on quality customer service  the desire of customers to deal with a local bank  the convenience of its maturing branch network and the breadth and depth of its expanding and sophisticated product line 
noninterest bearing demand accounts comprised of total deposits at december  compared to of total deposits at december  part of the reason for the increase in noninterest bearing demand accounts was associated with temporary insurance programs provided for these account types by the u 
s government 
because of the generally low rates paid on interest bearing account alternatives  many of the company s business customers chose to keep their balances in these more liquid and insured account types 
interest bearing demand  including money market and savings accounts  comprised of total deposits at december  compared to at the end of time accounts as a percentage of total deposits were at december  compared to at the end of additional information about the restrictions on the bank s deposit gathering activities may be found in item of this report under the heading recent business developments deposits and other funding activities  and is here incorporated by reference

critical accounting policies and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and future results could differ 
the allowance for loan loss  the status of contingencies  income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets are deemed critical due to the required level of management judgment and the use of estimates  making them particularly subject to change 
our methodology for determining the allowance for loan loss and the related provision for loan losses is described above in the allowance for loan losses discussion 
this area of accounting requires significant judgment due to the number of factors which can influence the collectibility of a loan 
unanticipated changes in these factors could significantly change the level of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses 
although  based upon our internal analysis  and in our judgment  we have provided an adequate allowance for loan losses  there can be no assurance that our analysis has properly identified all of the probable losses in our loan portfolio 
as a result  we could record future provisions for loan losses that may be significantly different than the levels that we recorded in loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
this  too  is an accounting area that involves significant judgment 
although  based upon our judgment and internal analysis we have properly accounted for loss contingencies  future changes in the status of such contingencies could result in a significant change in the level of contingent liabilities and a related impact to operating earnings 
our accounting for income taxes involves the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with differences in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million  gross deferred tax liabilities of million and a valuation allowance of million for the entire amount of net deferred tax assets 
accounting standards require that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
based upon a number of factors including our net operating loss for and and the challenging environment currently confronting banks that could negatively impact future operating results  we concluded the need for a valuation allowance during for the entire amount of our net deferred tax assets 
changes in tax laws  changes in tax rates and our future level of earnings can impact the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax asset as well as the valuation allowance that we established in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable
