item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and other information in this report  including risk factors set forth in item a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates  is our one reportable operating segment 
although we analyze revenue by commodity group  we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network 
executive summary results safety during  we continued our positive  multi year trend in safety performance by setting records in many of our safety metrics 
the employee injury incident rate per  man hours declined from to its lowest level ever 
our continued focus on derailment prevention resulted in a reduction in our incident rate in  with associated costs declining 
with respect to public safety  we closed grade crossings to reduce our exposure to incidents 
we also continued installing video cameras on our road locomotives  which assist us in reviewing grade crossing incidents  and we now have camera equipped locomotives in the lead position of over of our road trains 
during  we had the lowest number of crossing incidents on record  and the rate of grade crossing incidents per million train miles decreased 
also  we have implemented extensive trespass reduction programs  and trespasser incidents declined during the year 
these improvements reflect comprehensive efforts to enhance employee training  increase public education  make targeted capital investments  and eliminate or reduce safety risks 
financial performance in  we generated operating income of billion despite economic conditions that significantly reduced demand for our services across almost all market sectors 
while a reduction in volume drove the decrease in operating income  core pricing gains  improved productivity  and cost savings from demand driven resource adjustments translated into an all time record operating ratio of for  outpacing our previous record of set in net income of billion declined from billion in  but resulted in earnings of per diluted share for  surpassed only by financial results in freight revenues our freight revenues declined year over year to billion 
freight revenues and volumes for all six commodity groups decreased  reflecting adverse economic conditions 
overall  volume decreased in  with the largest declines in automotive and industrial products shipments 
lower fuel surcharges due to lower fuel prices also reduced freight revenues for the year  partially offset by core pricing gains 
we continued to focus on improving the reinvestibility of our business and we have repriced approximately of our business since network operations in  we built upon operational improvements achieved during by significantly improving the fluidity and efficiency of our transportation network  setting records in numerous operational metrics  including velocity  average terminal dwell  freight car utilization and service delivery 
lower volume levels  network management initiatives  and efforts to improve asset utilization were key drivers of our operational improvement 
we increased average train speed by and improved car utilization by with ongoing enhancements to our transportation plan and continued efforts to improve train processing at our terminals 
in  customer satisfaction improved to record levels  surpassing records established in  an indication that our ongoing efforts to improve operations again translated into better customer service 

table of contents asset utilization in response to economic conditions and lower revenue in  we implemented productivity initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce costs  in addition to adjusting our resources to reflect lower demand 
although varying throughout the year  our resource reductions included removing from service approximately of our road locomotives and of our freight car inventory by year end 
we also reduced shift levels at most rail facilities and closed or significantly reduced operations in of our principal rail yards 
these demand driven resource adjustments and our productivity initiatives combined to reduce our workforce by 
fuel prices as the economy worsened during the third and fourth quarters of  fuel prices dropped dramatically  reaching per barrel in december  a near five year low 
throughout  crude oil prices generally increased  ending the year around per barrel 
overall  our average fuel price decreased by in  reducing operating expenses by billion compared to we also reduced our consumption rate by during the year  saving approximately million gallons of fuel 
the use of newer  more fuel efficient locomotives  increased use of distributed locomotive power  fuel conservation programs  and improved network operations and asset utilization all contributed to this improvement 
free cash flow cash generated by operating activities totaled billion  yielding free cash flow of million in free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities  less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 
free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap by sec regulation g and item of sec regulation s k 
we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities dividends paid free cash flow outlook safety operating a safe railroad benefits our employees  our customers  our shareholders  and the public 
we will continue using a multi faceted approach to safety  utilizing technology  risk assessment  quality control  and training  and by engaging our employees 
we will continue implementing total safety culture tsc throughout our operations 
tsc is designed to establish  maintain  reinforce  and promote safe practices among co workers 
this process allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety 
reducing grade crossing incidents is a critical aspect of our safety programs  and we will continue our efforts to maintain  upgrade  and close crossings  install video cameras on locomotives  and educate the public about crossing safety through our own programs  various industry programs  and other activities 
transportation plan to build upon our success in recent years  we will continue evaluating traffic flows and network logistic patterns  which can be quite dynamic from year to year  to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations  remove network variability and improve network efficiency and asset utilization 
we plan to adjust manpower and our locomotive and rail car fleets to 
table of contents meet customer needs and put us in a position to handle demand changes 
we will also continue utilizing industrial engineering techniques to improve productivity 
fuel prices uncertainty about the economy makes fuel price projections difficult  and we could see volatile fuel prices during the year  as they are sensitive to global and us domestic demand  refining capacity  geopolitical issues and events  weather conditions and other factors 
to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings  we will continue to seek recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and to expand our fuel conservation efforts 
capital plan in  we plan to make total capital investments of approximately billion  including expenditures for ptc  which may be revised if business conditions or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments 
see further discussion in this item under liquidity and capital resources capital plan 
positive train control ptc in response to a legislative mandate to implement ptc by the end of  we expect to spend approximately million during on the development of ptc 
we currently estimate that ptc will cost us approximately billion to implement by the end of  in accordance with rules issued by the fra 
this includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks  upgrading locomotives to work with the new system  and adding digital data communication equipment so all the parts of the system can communicate with each other 
financial expectations we remain cautious about economic conditions but expect volume to increase from levels 
in addition  we anticipate continued pricing opportunities and further productivity improvements 
results of operations operating revenues millions of dollars change v change v freight revenues other revenues total freight revenues are revenues generated by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups 
freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc 
changes in price  traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc 
we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations  which we record as a reduction to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments 
we recognize freight revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 
other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries  revenues from our commuter rail operations  and accessorial revenues  which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage 
we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 
freight revenues and volume levels for all six commodity groups decreased during  reflecting continued economic weakness 
we experienced the largest volume declines in automotive and industrial 
table of contents products shipments 
lower fuel surcharges due to lower fuel prices also reduced freight revenues in compared to arc decreased during the full year  driven by lower fuel cost recoveries  partially offset by core pricing gain of approximately 
fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic  which is described below in more detail 
freight revenues from five of the six commodity groups increased during  with particularly strong growth from agricultural and energy shipments 
while revenues generated from chemical and industrial products shipments grew in compared to  hurricanes gustav and ike reduced shipments of these commodities 
revenues generated from automotive shipments declined versus greater fuel cost recoveries and core pricing improvement combined to increase arc during the severe economic downturn during the fourth quarter compounded already declining volumes experienced during the first nine months of due to ongoing weakness in certain market sectors 
as a result  we moved fewer intermodal  automotive  industrial products  and chemical shipments  which more than offset volume growth from agricultural and energy shipments 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated freight revenues of million  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
declines in both fuel prices and volume levels drove the lower fuel surcharge amounts in fuel surcharge revenues are not comparable across years due to implementation of new mileage based fuel surcharge programs 
as disclosed in our annual report on form k  the stb issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the stb 
in april  we converted regulated traffic  which represents approximately of our current revenue base  to mileage based fuel surcharge programs 
in addition  we continue to convert portions of our non regulated traffic to mileage based fuel surcharge programs 
at the time of introduction  we also reset the base fuel price at which the new mileage based fuel surcharges take effect 
resetting the fuel price at which the fuel surcharge begins  in conjunction with rebasing the affected transportation rate to include a portion of what had been in the fuel surcharge  did not materially change our freight revenue as higher base rates offset lower fuel surcharge revenue 
in  other revenues decreased from due primarily to lower revenues at our subsidiary that brokers intermodal and automotive services 
accessorial revenues also decreased in reflecting lower volume levels during the year 
the following tables summarize the year over year changes in freight revenues  revenue carloads  and arc by commodity type freight revenues millions of dollars change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total 
table of contents revenue carloads thousands change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total average revenue per car change v change v agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal average agricultural products lower volume and fuel surcharges decreased agricultural freight revenue in versus price improvements partially offset these declines 
lower demand in both export and domestic markets led to fewer shipments of corn and feed grains  down in compared to weaker worldwide demand also reduced export shipments of wheat and food grains in versus agricultural revenue logo price improvements  fuel surcharges  and volume growth generated higher agricultural freight revenue in versus strong global demand for grain and a weak dollar drove higher shipments of corn and feed grains and shipments of wheat and food grains for shipments of ethanol  a grain product used as an alternative fuel and fuel additive  and its co products primarily livestock feed also increased 

table of contents automotive declines in shipments of finished vehicles and auto parts and lower fuel surcharges reduced freight revenue in compared to vehicle shipments were down and parts were down 
core pricing gains partially offset these declines 
these volume declines resulted from economic conditions that reduced sales and vehicle production 
in addition  two major domestic automotive manufacturers declared bankruptcy in the second quarter of  affecting production levels 
although the federal car allowance rebate system the cash for clunkers program helped stimulate vehicle sales and shipments in the third quarter of  production cuts and soft demand throughout the year more than offset the program s benefits 
double digit declines in shipments of both finished vehicles and auto parts drove freight revenue lower in compared to automotive revenue logo price improvements and fuel surcharges partially offset these lower volumes 
the manufacturers experienced poor sales and reduced vehicle production during due to the recessionary economy  which in turn reduced shipments of finished vehicles and parts 
in addition  a major parts supplier strike reduced volume levels compared to shipments of finished vehicles decreased in versus chemicals reduced volume and fuel surcharges decreased freight revenue from chemical shipments in versus pricing improvements partially offset these declines 
weak market conditions reduced shipments of industrial chemicals in compared to  driving volume levels down 
high inventories  production curtailments  and delayed purchases combined to reduce fertilizer shipments by in additionally  business interruptions resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike lowered volume levels in the third quarter of  contributing to a more favorable year over year comparison 
chemicals revenue logo price improvements and increased fuel surcharges drove higher revenue from chemicals shipments during  which were partially offset by a decrease in volume levels compared to weak market conditions and business interruptions in chemical producing areas resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike all contributed to lower industrial chemicals shipments 
plastics shipments also declined in part due to the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike 

table of contents energy lower volume and fuel surcharges reduced freight revenue from energy shipments in versus price increases partially offset these declines 
shipments from the southern powder river basin of wyoming sprb and the colorado and utah mines decreased and  respectively  in compared to continued economic weakness and high coal inventories resulted in reduced demand at our utility customers  resulting in lower volumes 
production problems at the colorado and utah mines and the loss of sprb customer contracts also contributed to the volume declines 
energy revenue logo price increases  fuel surcharges  and higher volume produced revenue growth in versus shipments from the sprb were up compared to despite mine flooding and network interruptions caused by extensive flooding in the midwest in june of conversely  shipments from the colorado and utah mines were down in versus  due to mine production problems 
industrial products reduced volume and fuel surcharges resulted in lower freight revenue from industrial products shipments in versus price improvements partially offset these declines 
weak demand and inventory reductions resulting from the economic downturn drove a decline in steel shipments in compared to the continued weakness in the housing market reduced lumber shipments  while surplus production and overall market uncertainty resulted in lower paper and newsprint shipments in versus in addition  cement and stone shipments declined during the year due to high inventories and weak commercial and residential construction activity 
industrial products revenue logo price improvements and fuel surcharges contributed to higher freight revenue in compared to lower volume partially offset these increases 
continued softening of the housing market and weak market conditions resulted in lower lumber shipments 
in addition  cement and stone shipments declined due to a weak overall residential and commercial construction market 
business interruptions resulting from the hurricanes also reduced various construction related shipments  primarily stone 
conversely  we shipped more steel in than in as the weak dollar increased the cost of steel imports during most of the year  creating a strong demand for domestic steel 

table of contents intermodal decreased volumes and fuel surcharges reduced freight revenue from intermodal shipments in versus volume from international traffic decreased in compared to  reflecting economic conditions  continued weak imports from asia  and diversions to non uprr served ports 
additionally  continued weakness in the domestic housing and automotive sectors translated into weak demand in large sectors of the international intermodal market  which also contributed to the volume decline 
conversely  domestic traffic increased in compared to a new contract with hub group  inc  which included additional shipments  was executed in the second quarter of and more than offset the impact of weak market conditions in the second half of intermodal revenue logo price increases and fuel surcharges generated higher revenue in  partially offset by lower volume levels 
international traffic declined in  reflecting continued softening of imports from china and the loss of a customer contract 
notably  the peak intermodal shipping season  which usually starts in the third quarter  was particularly weak in additionally  continued weakness in domestic housing and automotive sectors translated into weak demand in large sectors of the international intermodal market  which also contributed to lower volumes 
domestic traffic declined in due to the loss of a customer contract and lower volumes from less than truckload shippers 
additionally  the flood related embargo on traffic in the midwest during the second quarter hindered intermodal volume levels in mexico business each of our commodity groups include revenue from shipments to and from mexico 
revenue from mexico business decreased in versus to billion 
volume declined in five of our six commodity groups  down in  driven by and reductions in industrial products and automotive shipments  respectively 
conversely  energy shipments increased in versus  partially offsetting these declines 
revenue from mexico business increased to billion in compared to price improvements and fuel surcharges contributed to these increases  partially offset by a decline in volume in compared to operating expenses millions of dollars change v change v compensation and benefits fuel purchased services and materials depreciation equipment and other rents other total 
table of contents operating expenses decreased billion in versus our fuel price per gallon declined during the year  decreasing operating expenses by billion compared to cost savings from lower volume  productivity improvements  and better resource utilization also decreased operating expenses in in addition  lower casualty expense resulting primarily from improving trends in safety performance decreased operating expenses in the year 
conversely  wage and benefit inflation partially offset these reductions 
operating expenses logo operating expenses increased million in our fuel price per gallon rose during the year  increasing operating expenses by billion compared to wage  benefit  and materials inflation  higher depreciation  and costs associated with the january cascade mudslide and hurricanes gustav and ike also increased expenses during the year 
cost savings from productivity improvements  better resource utilization  and lower volume helped offset these increases 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits include wages  payroll taxes  health and welfare costs  pension costs  other postretirement benefits  and incentive costs 
lower volume and productivity initiatives led to a decline in our workforce in compared to  saving million during the year 
conversely  general wage and benefit inflation increased expenses  partially offsetting these savings 
productivity initiatives in all areas  combined with lower volume  led to a decline in our workforce for  saving million compared to conversely  general wage and benefit inflation and higher pension and postretirement benefits increased expenses in  partially offsetting these reductions 
fuel fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non highway vehicles and heavy equipment 
lower diesel fuel prices  which averaged per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in compared to per gallon in  reduced expenses by billion 
volume  as measured by gross ton miles  decreased in the year  lowering expenses by million compared to our fuel consumption rate improved in  resulting in million of cost savings versus newer  more fuel efficient locomotives reflecting locomotive acquisitions in recent years and the impact of a smaller fleet due to storage of some of our older locomotives  increased use of distributed locomotive power  our fuel conservation programs  and improved network operations all drove this improvement 
distributed locomotive power is the practice of distributing locomotives throughout a train rather than positioning all of them in the lead resulting in safer and more efficient train operations 
diesel fuel prices  which averaged per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in compared to per gallon in  increased expenses by billion 
a improvement in our fuel consumption rate resulted in million of cost savings due to the use of newer  more fuel efficient locomotives  our fuel conservation programs  improved network operations  and a shift in commodity mix  primarily due to growth in bulk shipments 
volume  as measured by gross ton miles  decreased in the year  lowering expenses by million compared to purchased services and materials purchased services and materials expense includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors  materials used to maintain the railroad s lines  structures  and equipment  costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads  transportation and 
table of contents lodging for train crew employees  trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers  leased automobile maintenance expenses  and tools and supplies 
contract services expense including equipment maintenance decreased million in versus due to lower volume levels and a favorable year over year comparison due to expenses incurred in resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike 
in addition  lower volume levels drove cost reductions of million in transportation and lodging costs and million in expenses associated with operating jointly owned facilities in versus we also performed fewer locomotive and freight car repairs as a result of lower volumes and having portions of these fleets stored  which reduced related materials expenses by million in versus clean up and restoration expenses related to the cascade mudslide in january  flooding in the midwest in june  and the two september hurricanes also increased expenses in  creating a favorable year over year comparison 
in  higher contract costs including restoration costs related to the january cascade mudslide  june midwest flooding  and september hurricanes increased expenses million compared to higher material costs for freight car wheel sets during the year and an increase in the number of wheel sets required to repair flood damaged freight cars also contributed to higher materials expense in conversely  rail scrap proceeds associated with our rail replacement program partially offset these increases for the year 
depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to track structure  including rail  ties  and other track material 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting higher capital spending in recent years  increased depreciation expense in versus costs also increased million in due to the restructuring of certain locomotive leases see further discussion in this item under liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
lower depreciation rates for rail and other track material partially offset the increases 
the lower rates  which became effective january   resulted from longer asset lives as determined by service life studies and reduced track usage based on lower gross ton miles 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting higher capital spending in recent years  increased depreciation expense in versus equipment and other rents equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal  and locomotive leases  other specialty equipment leases  and office and other rentals 
fewer shipments of industrial products and intermodal containers primarily contributed to the million reduction in our short term freight car rental expense in versus in addition  the restructuring of locomotive leases reduced lease expense by million in compared to see further discussion in this item under liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
lower lease expense for freight cars  intermodal containers  and fleet vehicles also decreased costs in versus fewer shipments of finished vehicles  industrial products and intermodal containers reduced our short term freight car rental expense by million in compared to lower lease expense for freight cars  intermodal containers  and locomotives also decreased costs 
conversely  lease expense for fleet vehicles increased costs in compared to other other expenses include personal injury  freight and property damage  insurance  environmental  bad debt  state and local taxes  utilities  telephone and cellular  employee travel  computer software  and other general expenses 
other costs were lower in compared to driven by a reduction in personal injury expense including asbestos related claims 
we completed actuarial studies of personal injury expenses in both the second and fourth quarters of and and annual reviews of asbestos related claims in both years  which resulted in a net reduction of million in casualty expense in versus the reduction reflects improvements in our safety experience and lower estimated costs to resolve claims 
in addition  the year over year comparison was favorably impacted by million due to 
table of contents an adverse development with respect to one claim in and favorable developments in three cases in other costs were also lower in compared to  driven by a decrease in expenses for freight and property damages  employee travel  and utilities 
in addition  higher bad debt expense in due to the uncertain impact of the recessionary economy drove a favorable year over year comparison 
conversely  an additional expense of million related to a transaction with pacer international  inc and higher property taxes partially offset lower costs in other costs were higher in compared to due to an increase in bad debts  state and local taxes  loss and damage expenses  utility costs  and other miscellaneous expenses totaling million 
conversely  personal injury costs including asbestos related claims were million lower in compared to the reduction reflects improvements in our safety experience and lower estimated costs to resolve claims as indicated in the actuarial studies of our personal injury expense and annual reviews of asbestos related claims in both and the year over year comparison also includes the negative impact of adverse development associated with one claim in in addition  environmental and toxic tort expenses were million lower in compared to non operating items millions of dollars change v change v other income interest expense income taxes other income other income increased million in compared to primarily due to higher gains from real estate sales  which included the million pre tax gain from a land sale to the regional transportation district rtd in colorado and lower interest expense on our sale of receivables program  resulting from lower interest rates and a lower outstanding balance 
reduced rental and licensing income and lower returns on cash investments  reflecting lower interest rates  partially offset these increases 
other income decreased in compared to due to lower gains from real estate sales and decreased returns on cash investments reflecting lower interest rates 
higher rental and licensing income and lower interest expense on our sale of receivables program partially offset the decreases 
interest expense interest expense increased in versus due primarily to higher weighted average debt levels 
in  the weighted average debt level was billion including the restructuring of locomotive leases in may of  compared to billion in our effective interest rate was in  compared to in interest expense increased in versus due to a higher weighted average debt level of billion  compared to billion in a lower effective interest rate of in  compared to in  partially offset the effects of the higher weighted average debt level 
income taxes income taxes were lower in compared to  driven by lower pre tax income 
our effective tax rate for the year was compared to in income taxes were higher in compared to  driven by higher pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in resulted from several reductions in tax expense related to federal audits and state tax law changes 
in addition  the effective tax rate in was increased by illinois legislation that increased deferred tax expense in the third quarter of

average terminal dwell time average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals 
lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service 
average terminal dwell time improved slightly in compared to and improved in versus lower volumes combined with initiatives to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers improved dwell time in both periods 
gross and revenue ton miles gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled 
revenue ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles 
gross and revenue ton miles decreased and in compared to due to a decrease in carloads 
commodity mix changes notably automotive shipments  which were lower in compared to drove the difference in declines between gross ton miles and revenue ton miles 
gross ton miles decreased  while revenue ton miles were flat in compared to with commodity mix changes notably autos and coal explaining the variance in year over year growth between the two metrics 
operating ratio operating ratio is defined as our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue 
our operating ratios improved points to in and points to in core pricing gains  lower fuel prices  network management initiatives  and improved productivity drove the improvement in and more than offset the volume decline

if our bond rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity 
access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability

higher debt issuances of million partially offset these increases 
credit facilities on december   we had billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper 
we did not draw on the facility during commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated  investment grade borrowers 
the facility allows borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates  plus a spread  depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the facility requires union pacific corporation to maintain a debt to net worth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing 
at december   and december  and at all times during these periods  we were in compliance with this covenant 
the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt to net worth coverage ratio includes  among other things  certain credit arrangements  capital leases  guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa 
at december   the debt to net worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to billion of debt as defined in the facility  and we had billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date 
under our current capital plans  we expect to continue to satisfy the debt to net worth coverage ratio  however  many factors beyond our reasonable control including the risk factors in item a of this report could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future 
the facility does not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers other than rating dependent pricing  or any other provision that could require us to post collateral 
the facility also includes a million cross default provision and a change of control provision 
the facility will expire in april in accordance with its terms  and we currently intend to replace the facility with a substantially similar credit agreement on or before the expiration date  which is consistent with our past practices with respect to our credit facilities 
at december   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
our commercial paper balance is supported by our revolving credit facility but does not reduce the amount of borrowings available under the facility 
during  we issued million of commercial paper and repaid million 
at december   we reclassified as long term debt approximately million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance 
this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any short term borrowings and certain current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis 
at december   we reclassified as long term debt approximately million of debt due within one year that we intended to refinance at that time 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the years ended december    and  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was   and  respectively 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations  less equity earnings net of distributions  plus fixed charges and income taxes 
fixed charges represent interest charges  amortization of debt discount  and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 
see exhibit to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges

stock split on may   we completed a two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock split entitled all shareholders of record at the close of business on may   to receive one additional share of our common stock  par value per share  for each share of common stock held on that date 
share repurchase program on january   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of union pacific corporation common stock through the end of on may   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million common shares by march  management s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases 
during  we did not repurchase shares under this program 
in  we repurchased approximately million shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
these shares were recorded in treasury stock at cost  which includes any applicable commissions and fees 
if we elect to make repurchases of our common stock under this program in  we expect to fund such repurchases through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  debt issuances  and cash on hand 
shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings under our current shelf registration statement  we may issue  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 
in july  our board of directors authorized the issuance of an additional billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 
at december   we had remaining authority to issue up to billion of debt securities 
during  we issued the following unsecured  fixed rate debt securities under our current shelf registration date description of securities february  million of notes due february  february  million of notes due february  the net proceeds from these offerings were for general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program 
these debt securities include change of control provisions 
we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities  however  we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration  and  therefore  we may issue additional debt securities at any time 
during the second quarter of  we restructured lease agreements for locomotives resulting in a change in lease classification from operating to capital 
as part of the restructuring arrangements  we received million in cash consideration 
we recorded capital lease assets of approximately million and related capital lease obligations totaling approximately million

these capital lease obligations are reported in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt at december  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commercial commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item a of part ii of this report  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity

none of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of december  off balance sheet arrangements sale of receivables the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables  inc upri  a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  as part of a sale of receivables facility 
upri sells  without recourse on a day revolving basis  an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors 
the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was million and million at december  and  respectively 
during  upri reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors due to a decrease in available receivables 
the value of the undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements 
the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by million and  million of accounts receivable held by upri at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the value of the interest retained by upri was million and million  respectively 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements 
the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value  which approximates fair value  and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and dilution 
if default or dilution ratios increase one percent  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would not change as of december  should our credit rating fall below investment grade  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 
the railroad services the sold receivables  however  the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability  as the servicing fees adequately compensate us for these responsibilities 
the railroad collected approximately billion and billion during the years ended december  and  respectively 
upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 
the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the costs include interest  which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
the decrease in the costs was primarily attributable to lower commercial paper rates and a decrease in the outstanding interest held by investors 

table of contents the investors have no recourse to the railroad s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims 
creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 
in august  the sale of receivables facility was renewed for an additional day period at comparable terms and conditions  although the capacity to sell undivided interests was reduced from million to million 
see further discussion in this item under other matters accounting pronouncements for information about recent accounting pronouncements that will have an impact on the accounting treatment of our sale of receivables program 
guarantees at december   we were contingently liable for million in guarantees 
we have recorded a liability of million and million for the fair value of these obligations as of december  and  respectively 
we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business  and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building  equipment financings  and affiliated operations 
the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees 
we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
other matters inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions  and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings 
we may use swaps  collars  futures  and or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices  however  the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 
market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december  and  we were not required to provide collateral  nor had we received collateral  relating to our hedging activities 
determination of fair value we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

table of contents at december   we had variable rate debt representing approximately of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to an increase of approximately million to the fair value of our debt at december  we estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
interest rate fair value hedges we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings 
we employ derivatives  primarily swaps  as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates 
we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  therefore  we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate cash flow hedges we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item affects earnings 
at december  and  we had reductions of million and million  respectively  recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive income loss that is being amortized on a straight line basis through september  as of december  and  we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 
accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the update provides amendments to fasb asc that require entities to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition the update requires entities to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level

 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
in addition  the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting purposes 
therefore  formerly qualifying special purpose entities as defined under previous accounting standards should be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities on and after the effective date in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
fas will be effective for us beginning in after adoption  transfers of undivided interests in accounts receivable to investors under our sale of receivables program will no longer qualify for sale treatment  but rather will be accounted for as secured borrowings

these new disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
change in accounting principle we have historically accounted for rail grinding costs as a capital asset 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will change our accounting policy for rail grinding costs from a capitalization method  under which we have capitalized the cost of rail grinding and depreciated such capitalized costs  to a direct expense method  under which we will expense rail grinding costs as incurred 
the expense as incurred method is preferable  as it eliminates the subjectivity in determining 
table of contents the period of benefit associated with rail grinding over which to depreciate the associated capitalized costs 
we will reflect this change as a change in accounting principle from an acceptable accounting principle to a preferable accounting principle 
the application of this preferable accounting principle will be presented retrospectively to all periods presented in future earnings releases and sec filings 
when the accounting principle is retrospectively applied  net income for the years ended december    and will decrease by approximately million  million  and million  or  and per share  respectively 
this change in accounting principle is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
asserted and unasserted claims various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity  however  to the extent possible  where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded a liability 
we do not expect that any known lawsuits  claims  environmental costs  commitments  contingent liabilities  or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 
indemnities our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements  including certain tax indemnifications  can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount  depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements 
due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved  we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements 
we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 
climate change although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item a of this report  we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact 
however  we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment  including investments in new technologies  using training programs to reduce fuel consumption  and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note to the financial statements and supplementary data  item these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
personal injury the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
we use third party actuaries to assist us in measuring the expense and liability  including unasserted claims 
the federal employers liability act fela governs compensation for work related accidents 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 

table of contents our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims  and approximately related to unasserted claims at december  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims  it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately million to million 
we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other 
our personal injury liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december our personal injury claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos 
we engage a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability 
this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs 
the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions the ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages 
the number of claims filed against us will decline each year 
the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages 
the percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages 

table of contents our liability for asbestos related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately related to unasserted claims at december  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claims  it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately million to million 
we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other 
in conjunction with the liability update performed in  we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries 
we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december  and our asbestos related liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals credits payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december our asbestos related claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestos related claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable 
the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates also may vary in the future if strategies  activities  and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change  federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants  and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 
environmental we are subject to federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
we identified sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 

table of contents when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned  leased  or otherwise used in our business  we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs 
we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 
at december   approximately of our environmental liability was discounted at  while approximately of our environmental liability was discounted at at december  our environmental liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december our environmental site activity was as follows open sites  beginning balance new sites closed sites open sites  ending balance at december the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws  and regulations 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal  state  and local laws governing environmental remediation 
current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
property and depreciation our railroad operations are highly capital intensive  and our large base of homogeneous  network type assets turns over on a continuous basis 
each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers 
assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria 
properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated service lives  which are measured in years  except for rail in high density traffic corridors ie  all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment  yard and switching tracks  and electronic yards  which are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track 
we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics  use  and expected life are grouped together in asset classes  and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates 
the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources  not as singular items 
we currently have more than depreciable asset classes  
table of contents and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology  asset strategies  or other factors 
we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies 
we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie  rail and other track material  ties  and ballast and other road property 
our depreciation studies take into account the following factors statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes  evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets  evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices  and expected salvage to be received upon retirement 
for rail in high density traffic corridors  we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track 
it has been our experience that the lives of rail in high density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie  the amount of weight carried over the rail 
the service lives also vary based on rail weight  rail condition  eg  new or secondhand  and rail type eg  straight or curve 
our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives 
for rail in high density traffic corridors  we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton miles carried over the rail ie  the weight of loaded and empty freight cars  locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile 
rail in high density traffic corridors accounts for approximately percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material 
based on the number of gross ton miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during  the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from years to years 
for all other depreciable assets  we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies 
changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 
estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use  technology  asset strategies  and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets 
we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets 
actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates  which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 
changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes  which did not significantly affect our annual depreciation expense 
under group depreciation  the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized 
the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful life of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies 
the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes 
because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired  we continually monitor the estimated service 
table of contents lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate 
for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business  a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual  ii is material in amount  and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies 
during the last three fiscal years  no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
for example  a increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on management s judgments using available evidence about future events 
the valuation allowance at december  was million 
there was no valuation allowance at december  at times  we may claim tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority 
we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 
pension and other postretirement benefits we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses  we must make several assumptions
