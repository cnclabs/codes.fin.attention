critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to accounting for the valuation of our short term investments  stock based compensation  long lived assets  goodwill  and valuation of net deferred tax assets have a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations discussed below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
short term investments our short term investments are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on these securities  if determined to be temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we assess the recoverability of our short term investments and  if an impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value 
other than temporary impairments are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
we invested in auction rate securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us from liquidating certain holdings of auction rate securities as the amount of securities submitted for sale during the auction has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
although an event of an auction failure does not necessarily mean that a security is impaired  we consider various factors to assess the fair value and the classification of the securities as short term assets 
fair value was determined with the assistance of an independent valuation firm using two valuation methods a discounted cash flow method and a market comparable method 
certain factors used in these methods include  but are not necessarily limited to  comparable securities traded on secondary markets  timing of the failed auction  specific security 
table of contents auction history  quality of underlying collateral  rating of the security and the bond insurer  our ability and intent to retain the securities for a period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in the market value  and other factors 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation 
this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the look back period corresponding to the expected life 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in  we estimated this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting exercise and forfeiture history 
our estimate of the risk free interest rate is based on united states treasury debt securities with maturities close to the expected term of the option as of the date of grant 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
also  the accounting estimate of stock based compensation expense is reasonably likely to change from period to period as further stock options are granted and adjustments are made for stock option forfeitures and cancellations 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
such costs include internal research and development expenditures such as salaries and benefits  raw materials and supplies and contracted services such as sponsored research  consulting and testing services of proprietary research and development activities and similar expenses associated with collaborative research agreements 
impairments of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed by performing a periodic evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of an asset should be assessed include  but are not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant physical change in an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses  and or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue 
we consider historical performance and anticipated future results in our evaluation of potential impairment 
accordingly  when indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets 
impairment losses are recognized when the sum of expected future cash flows is less than the assets carrying value 
goodwill goodwill originally resulted from a business acquisition in assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to impairment tests annually  or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
we utilize both the market approach and the income approach to determine if we have an impairment of our goodwill 
the market approach serves as the primary approach and is based on market value of invested capital 
the concluded fair value significantly exceeded the carrying 
table of contents value of our goodwill at december  and the income approach is used as a confirming look to the market approach 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we perform the required annual impairment test as of december of each year on the carrying amount of our goodwill 
given the current economic conditions and the uncertainties regarding their impact on us  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future  or that any change in the assumptions or the current economic conditions will not trigger another goodwill impairment test before december  if our assumptions are not achieved or economic conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities  and deferred tax assets and liabilities  are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not would be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  and the applicable statute of limitations 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  our net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
recently adopted accounting guidance in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc  generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the sole source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
pursuant to the provisions of asc  we have updated references to gaap in our financial statements issued beginning for the period ended september  the adoption of asc did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
effective january   we prospectively adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  with respect to fair value measurements required for our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  asc  business combinations  was amended for provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
under the amended guidance  assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies should be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
if fair value cannot be determined  companies should typically account for the acquired contingencies using existing guidance 
this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in april  asc was amended to provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
this amendment also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
this amendment was effective for the quarter ended june  and the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  asc  investments debt equity securities  was amended to provide guidance for other than temporary impairments of debt securities 
the amendment provides that financial asset impairment indicators should be based on the company s intent to sell the security instead of the company s ability to hold the security  and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
this amendment was effective for the quarter ended june  and the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date  but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  asc establishes i the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  ii the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and iii the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
we have evaluated all subsequent events through the date of issuance of our financial statements 
we adopted asc for the quarter ended june  and the adoption did not have any effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for the company beginning january  the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  was issued and will change the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted 
the impact of asu on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the nature and terms of our revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
however  based on our current customer arrangements  we do not believe the adoption of this asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which amends topic to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements related to level measurements 
asu also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the asu is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   except for the requirements to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for 
table of contents interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is permitted 
we believe the adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to the completion of our gmp pilot manufacturing facility  which was ready for use in early we used our short term investments in to help fund operations

the increase in our financing activities consists primarily of increased sales of our common stock  partially offset by the repayment of our notes in we have entered into agreements with outside providers to support our clinical development 
as of december   million remains unpaid on certain of these agreements in the event our outside providers complete their services in however  under the terms of the agreements  we have the option to terminate  but we would be obligated to pay the provider for all costs incurred through the effective date of termination

we will seek additional capital through further public or private equity offerings  debt financing  additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  non dilutive government contracts  collaborative arrangements  or some combination of these financing alternatives

changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  could impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we had previously invested in auction rate securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
short term investments at december  consist of investments in three auction rate securities with a par value of million and a fair value of million 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to these securities in  which was partially offset by realized gains of million relating to redemptions of several auction rate securities 
at december   we have recorded million in unrealized gains on the auction rate securities held by us at year end in other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet 
these investments are classified within current assets because we may need to liquidate these securities within the next year to fund our ongoing operations 
interest and dividend income is recorded when earned and included in interest income 
premiums and discounts  if any  on short term investments are amortized or accreted to maturity and included in interest income 
the specific identification method is used in computing realized gains and losses on sale of our securities 
we are headquartered in the united states where we conduct the vast majority of our business activities 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 

table of contents we do not have material debt and  as such  do not believe that we are exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of our borrowing activities
