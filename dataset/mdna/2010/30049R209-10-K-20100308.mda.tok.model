the current tax expense for the year ended december   primarily related to our uk based operations 
the deferred tax benefit was related to the intangible assets related to our uk based operations 
in conjunction with the acquisition of evolving systems uk  we recorded certain identifiable intangible assets 
since the amortization of these identifiable intangibles is not deductible for income tax purposes  we established a long term deferred tax liability of million at the acquisition date for the expected difference between what would be expensed for financial reporting purposes and what would be deductible for income tax purposes 
as of december  and  this deferred tax liability was million and million  respectively 
the deferred tax liability relates to evolving systems uk and has no impact on our ability to recover the uk based deferred tax assets 
this deferred tax liability will be recognized as the identifiable intangibles are amortized 
we recorded a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets as of december  and as we determined that it was more likely than not that we will not realize our us deferred tax assets 
such assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
we made our assessment of the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets using all available evidence 
in particular  we considered both historical results and projections of profitability for only the reasonably foreseeable future periods and any tax planning strategies 
should we continue to generate taxable income in the us  we may need to reassess our valuation allowance 
effective january   we adopted a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
there was no material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations as a result of the adoption of this adoption 
upon adoption  we recorded an adjustment consisting of a million decrease in our deferred tax assets related to research and development tax credits that was offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance 
as of december  and  we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not believe there will be any material changes to our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months 
financial condition our working capital position of million at december  reflects an increase of million from our working capital position of million at december  our working capital position increased at december  despite million in existing cash used to retire our subordinated notes  including accrued non current interest 
these payments were made from cash on hand and million in borrowings on our uk revolving credit facility 
the subordinated debt payments were unscheduled and reduced balances classified as long term as of december  these debt payments were unscheduled and reduced balances classified as long term as of december  we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of december  and liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed operations through cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity transactions 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million in cash and cash equivalents and million of unused availability under our revolving credit facilities 
the revolving credit facilities are available through february net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
our increased profitability in was offset by optional pre payments of accrued interest on our subordinated debt  which is classified as other long term obligations and the change in the timing of our unearned revenue billings 
the primary contribution to the improvement in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was due primarily to an improved net income of million compared to net income of million for the year ended december  additionally  the net change in operating assets and liabilities decreased million in versus net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

table of contents senior term loan of approximately million  net of issuance costs 
the net cash used in financing activities during is the result of million in principal payments on our senior debt facility 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  together with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in making this assessment  we considered the following our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  of million  the availability under our revolving credit facility of million at december   our improved working capital balance of million  our demonstrated ability to generate positive operating cash flows  our backlog of approximately million  including million in license fees and services and million in customer support at december   and our planned capital expenditures of less than million during our revolving credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that  if breached  could result in any outstanding amounts becoming immediately due and payable 
if we are required to pay the debt on an accelerated basis  it could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
we are exposed to foreign currency rate risks which impact the carrying amount of our foreign subsidiaries and our consolidated equity  as well as our consolidated cash position due to translation adjustments 
for the year ended december   the effect of exchange rate changes resulted in a million increase to consolidated cash 
for the year ended december   the effect of exchange rate changes resulted in a million reduction to consolidated cash 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure  but we closely monitor the rate changes and may hedge our exposures in the future

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when an agreement is signed  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we 
table of contents recognize revenue from two primary sources license fees and services  and customer support 
the majority of our license fees and services revenue is generated from fixed price contracts  which provide for licenses to our software products and services to customize such software to meet our customers use 
when the services are determined to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion for each contract based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to total estimated direct labor hours and recognize revenue based on the percent complete multiplied by the contract amount 
since estimated direct labor hours  and changes thereto  can have a significant impact on revenue recognition  these estimates are critical and we review them regularly 
we record amounts billed in advance of services being performed as unearned revenue 
unbilled work in progress represents revenue earned but not yet billable under the terms of the fixed price contracts 
all such amounts are expected to be billed and collected within months 
we may encounter budget and schedule overruns on fixed price contracts caused by increased labor or overhead costs 
we make adjustments to cost estimates in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
we record estimated losses  if any  in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
if revisions to cost estimates are obtained after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the interim or annual financial statements  we make adjustments to the interim or annual financial statements accordingly 
in arrangements where the services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software  we recognize license revenue when a license agreement has been signed  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
where applicable  we unbundle and record as revenue fees from multiple element arrangements as the elements are delivered to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements exist 
if vsoe for the undelivered elements does not exist  we defer fees from such arrangements until the earlier of the date that vsoe does exist on the undelivered elements or all of the elements have been delivered 
we recognize revenue from fixed price service contracts using the proportional performance method of accounting  which is similar to the percentage of completion method described above 
we recognize revenue from professional services provided pursuant to time and materials based contracts and training services as the services are performed  as that is when our obligation to our customers under such arrangements is fulfilled 
we recognize customer support  including maintenance revenue  ratably over the service contract period 
when maintenance is bundled with the original license fee arrangement  its fair value  based upon vsoe  is deferred and recognized during the periods when services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments related to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for receivables when their collection becomes doubtful by recording an expense 
we determine the allowance based on our assessment of the realization of receivables using historical information and current economic trends  including assessing the probability of collection from customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments owed to us  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be required 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance regularly and make adjustments accordingly 
adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income projections  historical results and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
however  adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is less or greater than the amount that we recorded 
such adjustments  if any  could have a material impact on our results of our operations 
effective january   we adopted a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
there was no material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations as a result of this adoption 
on january   we recorded a transition adjustment consisting of a million decrease in our deferred tax assets related to research and development tax credits that was offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance 
as of december  and  we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not believe there will be any material changes to our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators may include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
for purposes of the goodwill evaluation  we compare the fair value of each of our 
table of contents reporting units to its respective carrying amount 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  we would then compare the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount  and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss 
intangible assets we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill 
we amortize certain intangible assets over their estimated lives 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and or our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition and compare that to the asset s carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized would represent the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
significant estimates and judgments are required when estimating such fair values 
if we determine that the intangibles are impaired  we will record an impairment charge and the amount could be material 
amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of purchased software and licenses  customer contracts and relationships  trademarks and tradenames  and business partnerships acquired in conjunction with our purchases of cms communications  inc cms  telecom software enterprises  llc tse and tertio telecoms ltd 
evolving systems uk 
these definite life assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated lives 
capitalization of internal software development costs we expend amounts on research and development  particularly for new products and or for enhancements of existing products 
for internal development of software products that are to be licensed by us  we expense the cost of developing software prior to establishing technological feasibility and those costs are capitalized once technological feasibility has been established 
capitalization ceases upon general release of the software 
the determination of whether internal software development costs are subject to capitalization is  by its nature  highly subjective and involves significant judgments 
this decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period 
further  once capitalized  the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product 
the determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental 
finally  capitalized software costs must be assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances warrant such a review 
we did not capitalize any internal software development costs during the years ended december    or in addition  we did not have any capitalized internal software development costs included in our december  and consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that during these periods no material internal software development costs were required to be capitalized 
our conclusion is primarily based on the fact that the feature rich  pre integrated  and highly scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design  coding and testing methodologies  which include next generation software languages and development tools 
development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk 
substantially all of our internal software development efforts are of this nature  and therefore  we believe the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general release of the software to operations is so short that any costs incurred during this period are not material 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by applying a fair value based measurement method to account for share based payment transactions with employees and directors and record compensation cost for all stock awards granted after january  and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date

this model requires the use of estimates for expected term of the options and expected volatility of the price of our common stock
