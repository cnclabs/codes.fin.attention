we market our service to large business to consumer  or bc  companies in the financial services  telecommunications and media  retail and utility industries  as well as to companies in the collection industries 
our clients are located principally in the united states  but we have enhanced our service offering to enable us to deliver multi channel proactive customer communications in countries outside the united states and we plan to begin marketing our service internationally  both directly and through our partners  commencing in europe 
we sell our service primarily through our direct sales force 
we are seeking to increase our revenues from resellers  solution providers  original equipment manufacturers and international distributors both by leveraging existing relationships and by selectively recruiting additional new partners 
key components of results of operations revenues we currently derive substantially all of our revenues by providing our pcc service for use by clients in communicating with their customers through voice  text and email messages 
we provide our service under a usage based pricing model  with prices calculated on a per message or per minute basis in accordance with the terms of our pricing agreements with clients 
we invoice clients on a monthly basis 
our pricing agreements with clients typically do not require minimum levels of usage or payments 
each executed message represents a transaction from which we derive revenues  and we therefore recognize revenue based on actual usage within a calendar month 
we do not recognize revenue until we can determine that 
table of contents persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and we deem collection to be probable 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of telephony charges  as well as depreciation expenses for our telephony infrastructure and expenses related to hosting and providing support for our platform 
cost of revenues also includes compensation expense for our operations personnel 
as we continue to grow our business and add features to our platform  we expect cost of revenues will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis 
our gross margin was in  in and in we currently are targeting a quarterly gross margin of to for the foreseeable future 
our actual gross margin for a quarter may vary significantly from our target range for a number of reasons  including the mix of types of messaging campaigns executed during the quarter  as well as the extent to which we build our infrastructure through  for example  significant acquisitions of hardware or material increases in leased data center facilities 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses and depreciation expense of certain equipment related to the development of our service 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on improving and enhancing our platform  as well as developing new features and offerings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  including sales commissions  as well as the costs of our marketing programs 
we expect to further invest in developing our marketing strategy and activities to extend brand awareness and generate additional leads for our sales staff 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation expenses for executive  finance  accounting  administrative and management information systems personnel  accounting and legal professional fees and other corporate expenses 
we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with being a public company  including the costs of implementing and maintaining new financial systems to enable us to meet our financial reporting and regulatory compliance requirements 
additional key measures of financial performance we present information below with respect to cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
free cash flow is a measure of financial performance calculated as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment 
management uses these metrics to track business performance 
due to the current economic environment  management decisions are based in part  on a goal of maintaining positive cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
we believe these metrics are useful measures of the performance of our business because  in contrast to income statement metrics that rely principally on revenue and profitability  cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow capture the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year and the effect of noncash items such as depreciation and stock based compensation 
we believe that  for similar reasons  these metrics are often used by security analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of on demand and other software companies 
the term free cash flow is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
all or a portion of free cash flow may be unavailable for discretionary expenditures 
free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  you should not consider 
table of contents free cash flow in isolation from  or as a substitute for  data such as net income loss  derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
as of december  in thousands cash flows used in provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment free cash flow non gaap our operating activities used net cash in the amount of  for the year ended december  reflecting a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets of  mainly due to the timing of receipts from our clients 
these changes were partially offset by non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million  as well as an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of  due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
our operating activities generated net cash in the amount of million for the year ended december  reflecting a a net loss of million  b non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million  and c a decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets of  these changes were partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of  due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
the net loss of million includes million received in connection with the settlement of the lawsuit with universal recovery systems  offset in part by million of related expenses 
our operating activities generated net cash in the amount of million for the year ended december  reflecting a net income of  b non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million and a preferred stock warrant charge of  and c an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million 
these changes reflected the growth in our business  the timing of payments to our vendors and the addition of non cash charges related to carrying certain warrants at fair value prior to our initial public offering 
these changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables of million due to revenue growth in our business and an increase of  in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
free cash flow in each of the years presented reflects  in addition to the factors driving cash flow from operating activities  our purchases of property and equipment  which consists primarily of computer equipment and software 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
a critical accounting policy is one that both is material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess our ability to collect outstanding client invoices and in so doing must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine 
table of contents that the collection of an outstanding client receivable is not probable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  client creditworthiness  and changes in our client payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if any of these factors change  our estimates may also change  which could affect the levels of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
valuation of goodwill we have recognized goodwill from a asset acquisition in which a significant portion of the consideration is contingent on the future revenues of the acquired assets 
because of the uncertainties with respect to future revenues  the contingent consideration is recognized as additional purchase price as the consideration is determined and becomes payable 
we have remaining contingent consideration totaling million at december   which will increase the recorded carrying value of our goodwill if the contingencies result in additional payments 
recorded goodwill at december  totaled  goodwill is not amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis for impairment and have selected november as the annual impairment testing date 
the company operates as a single operating segment and has concluded that the company is comprised of one reporting unit 
during the third and fourth quarters of  as well as each of the quarters of  as a result of the economic environment impacting the company s business and operating results coupled with a material decline of the company s stock price  the company determined that impairment triggering events had occurred that would require interim impairment evaluations 
therefore  in addition to the annual november review date  the company initiated a review of the carrying value of the goodwill for possible impairment during each of these quarters 
the company determined the fair value of its reporting unit using the market approach  which was based upon the company s current market capitalization 
this review indicated that the carrying value of its goodwill may be impaired as september   december   march  and june  at each of these date  the company then compared the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill balance at each of these dates was deemed to be zero 
this resulted in impairment charges of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  no impairment was indicated at september  and december   however  our stock price is volatile and future changes in the quoted price of our stock and other judgments that underlay the fair value estimates may indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  which may result in future impairment charges 
income taxes we are subject to federal and various state income taxes in the united states  and we use estimates in determining our provision for these income taxes 
in addition  we are subject to canadian taxes for profits generated from our wholly owned subsidiary 
deferred tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities are determined separately by tax jurisdiction 
at december   our deferred tax assets consisted primarily of federal net operating loss carryforwards and state research and development credit carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized  and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately million  due to the current uncertainty related to when  if ever  these assets will be realized 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period in which such a determination is made

liquidity and capital resources resources since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from private placements of preferred stock  borrowings under credit facilities and  more recently  cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our initial public offering in november we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  our cash flow from operating activities  and our borrowings available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rates of our revenue growth  our introduction of new features for our on demand service  and our expansion of research and development and sales and marketing activities 
to the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products 
if additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or to effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all

our assets serve as collateral for any borrowings under the credit facility 
there are certain financial covenant requirements as part of the facility  including an adjusted quick ratio and certain minimum quarterly revenue requirements  none of which are restrictive to our overall operations

they were invested primarily in money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
fluctuations vary depending on cash collections  client mix and the volume of monthly usage of our service 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on an annual basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  divided by revenues for the most recent year  multiplied by b the number of days in the year 
our dso was days at december   days at december  and days at december  requirements capital expenditures in recent years  we have made capital expenditures primarily to acquire computer hardware and software and  to a lesser extent  furniture and leasehold improvements  to support the growth of our business

effects of inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business since january   and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
however  the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  cost of revenues and operating expenses  primarily employee compensation costs  may not be readily recoverable in the pricing of our service 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k of the sec 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
these amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and early adoption is permitted 
we expect to adopt the amendments beginning january  the new guidance modifies the criteria for the separation of deliverables into units of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
we have not yet determined the effect that adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements
