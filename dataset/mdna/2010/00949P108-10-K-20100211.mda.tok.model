overview all of the flight operations of airtran holdings  inc the company  airtran  or holdings are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  airtran airways  inc airtran airways or airways collectively we  our  or us 
airtran airways is one of the largest low cost scheduled airlines in the united states in terms of departures and seats offered 
we operate scheduled airline service throughout the united states and to selected international locations 
approximately half of our flights originate or terminate at our largest hub in atlanta  georgia and we serve a number of markets with non stop service from our focus cities of baltimore  maryland  milwaukee  wisconsin  and orlando  florida 
as of february   we operated boeing b aircraft b and boeing b aircraft b offering approximately scheduled flights per day to locations in the united states  including san juan  puerto rico  as well as to orangestad  aruba  cancun  mexico  and nassau  the bahamas 
our positive operating results in were based  in part  on traditional elements of our success competitive fares  superior service  an attractive network  and product value  low unit costs  adaptability  flexibility  innovation  and the enthusiasm and skills of our employees 
capacity and network changes prior to  we positioned ourselves as a growth airline 
we successfully grew our capacity as measured by available seat miles at double digit rates annually from through nevertheless  in  to respond to the challenges of a volatile fuel cost environment  a weak macroeconomic environment  and adverse capital market conditions  we recast our plans which resulted in our deferral of previously planned growth 
we reduced planned capacity  principally by deferring scheduled aircraft deliveries  and selling b aircraft 
by adjusting our business strategy and implementing revised tactics  we believe that we have positioned airtran to more effectively deal with a volatile fuel cost environment and reduced demand for air travel due to weak macroeconomic conditions 
as a result of our actions  our capacity growth slowed to percent in  we reduced capacity by percent in  and we currently expect our capacity to grow by three to four percent in during we continued to develop our route network by substantially increasing our presence in orlando  baltimore  and milwaukee  initiating service to seven domestic locations  and initiating service to three international destinations 
more specifically  during  we doubled the size of our milwaukee operations  as measured by available seat miles asms 
the new flights are part of our strategy to expand service from general mitchell international airport in milwaukee and build our presence in the midwest 
together with our marketing partner skywest airlines  in february  we will serve non stop destinations to and from milwaukee 
initiated new service to allentown bethlehem  pennsylvania  asheville  north carolina  atlantic city  new jersey  branson  missouri  charleston  west virginia  key west  florida  and knoxville  tennessee 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced that we would resume service to gulfport  mississippi in january we also announced service to lexington  kentucky  which commenced in february  and we announced service to des moines  iowa  which is expected to commence in march we also suspended service to three us cities for which the revenue performance was not meeting our expectations 
expanded our presence in the caribbean in by adding service to orangestad  aruba  cancun  mexico  and nassau  the bahamas 
in the third quarter of  we announced service to montego bay  jamaica  which commenced in february we believe that we are enhancing the airtran airways travel experience by offering flights to these popular tourist destinations 
key initiatives after six consecutive years of profitability  during  we were faced with record high jet fuel prices  an adverse macroeconomic environment  and disrupted capital markets 
during  we undertook a variety of actions to respond to these challenges including reducing capacity starting in september  deferring new aircraft deliveries  selling aircraft  reducing other capital expenditures  implementing increases in certain fares and ancillary fees  entering into a variety of derivative financial arrangements to hedge the cost of fuel  and managing our costs and employment levels 
we also completed capital market transactions in exceeding million  including issuing convertible debt and common stock  entering into a letter of credit facility to reduce our exposure to holdbacks of cash remittances by a credit card processor  and obtaining a combined letter of credit facility the letter of credit facility and revolving line of credit facility the revolving line of credit facility which combined facility is referred to as the credit facility 
during  we took additional steps to enhance our liquidity and our operating performance substantially improved 
in september  our credit facility was amended to  among other things extend the expiration date of the facility to december   increase the amount that may be borrowed under the revolving line of credit facility to million  and reduce the maximum aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit plus outstanding borrowing to million 
during october  we completed a public offering of million of our convertible senior notes due in and a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from the two offerings  which aggregated million  were used for general corporate purposes including improving our overall liquidity 
we also continued to utilize a variety of derivative financial arrangements to hedge the costs of fuel and interest rate volatility 
recent operating results as summarized below  our operating results for were substantially improved compared to the pronounced reduction in jet fuel price levels during compared to  coupled with the actions that we undertook to reduce and redeploy capacity  increase ancillary revenues  and control costs produced the improved operating results 
in thousands  unless otherwise noted selected financial and operating data operating revenue operating income loss net gain loss on derivative financial instruments net income loss available seat miles asm total revenue per asm in cents operating cost per asm in cents gallons of fuel burned average cost of aircraft fuel per gallon in dollars our operating income improved by million compared to fuel prices retreated in from the record high levels 
the reduction in the average cost of jet fuel per gallon resulted in a million decrease in our aircraft fuel expense during compared to what fuel expense would have been had jet fuel prices been at the average level experienced during the favorable impacts of lower fuel prices coupled with actions we took to reduce and redeploy capacity  increase ancillary revenues and control costs were somewhat offset by the unfavorable impacts of adverse macroeconomic conditions and higher non fuel unit operating costs 
more specifically  our total unit revenue per available seat mile decreased by percent to cents and our non fuel unit operating costs per available seat mile increased by percent to cents compared to continuing a trend which started in september  in  we reduced capacity as measured by available seat miles 
we believe that the percent reduction in capacity compared to capacity had the salutary effect of partially mitigating the unfavorable impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions on our unit revenues 
however  the capacity reduction was also a contributing factor to the increase in our non fuel unit operating costs 
as summarized below  our operating results for the second half of were impacted by increased jet fuel prices

the year was the fifth consecutive year for which airtran ranked third or higher for quality among all us carriers in this prestigious rating which is based on four major areas on time performance  denied boardings  mishandled baggage  and customer complaints 
researchers at the university of nebraska at omaha aviation institute and the w 
frank barton school of business at wichita state university conduct the study each year 
in january  airtran airways was awarded the prestigious market leadership award from leading industry publication  air transport world  for airtran s innovative combination of low cost  high quality service and response to the global financial crisis 
during  we carried million revenue passengers  became the first major airline to offer passengers wireless  broadband internet access on every flight 
airtran passengers now have full internet access including web  e mail  instant messaging and access to corporate e mail and network systems virtual private networks through their wi fi mobile communication and information devices 
the today show produced a live remote broadcast from  feet over the eastern seaboard on the day we launched our gogo in flight internet service  announced that we will commence scheduled services to des moines  iowa  gulfport  mississippi  lexington  kentucky  and montego bay  jamaica  in  initiated service to allentown bethlehem  pennsylvania  asheville  north carolina  atlantic city  new jersey  branson  missouri  charleston  west virginia  key west  florida  knoxville  tennessee  as well as orangestad  aruba  cancun  mexico  and nassau  the bahamas  launched other new non stop routes  entered into a new marketing agreement with skywest airlines inc  a subsidiary of skywest  inc  to support our milwaukee focus city 
service under this new agreement commenced in late under this new agreement  skywest airlines offers regional jet service between milwaukee and six destinations 
these flights are operated by skywest airlines and are available for customers to book through airtran s normal distribution channels 
seats on these flights are sold in conjunction with airtran airways flights with revenue shared on a pro rated basis 
once fully implemented in february  skywest airlines will offer daily non stop flights from milwaukee to six destinations  and  together with our marketing partner  we will serve non stop destinations to and from milwaukee  entered into a multi year partnership with the national football league s atlanta falcons that includes joint promotions  prominent signage at the georgia dome  a specially designed  falcons themed boeing  and billboards and other advertising featuring falcons players in full uniform  became the official airline of the national basketball association s orlando magic  entering into a multi year partnership that includes designation as a magic champion of the community  unparalleled team and facility access  brand recognition visibility  category exclusivity  and a specially designed  magic themed boeing  unveiled specially designed  baltimore ravens and indianapolis colts themed boeing aircraft  and partnered with comedian mark malkoff  who lived on an aircraft for days in june and flew flights  setting a new guinness world record 
outlook we expect to face challenges during managing costs and increasing unit revenues in the face of volatile fuel costs and a weak economy will continue to be a primary focus 
fuel prices remain volatile and may again increase in additionally  the pace and extent of the recovery of airline industry revenue are uncertain 
our pilots collective bargaining agreement became amendable in and is currently in mediation 
our flight attendants collective bargaining agreement became amendable in december and is currently the subject of negotiation 
the impact on our operating results of any new collective bargaining agreement is not known 
compared to  we expect our capacity  as measured by available seats miles asms  to increase by seven to eight percent for the first quarter and to increase by three to four percent for as a whole 
we also expect our first quarter total revenue per asm to increase by two and one half to three and one half percent compared to the first quarter of we project our unit non fuel costs per asm to increase by two and one half to three percent for the first quarter and to increase by three to four percent for as a whole 
we anticipate that our non fuel unit operating costs will increase due to increases in aircraft maintenance costs  higher employee compensation costs due to higher wage rates attributable to higher average employee seniority and wage scales  increased revenue related costs  and higher airport rents and landing fees 
the increased aircraft maintenance costs will be due to the aging of each of our aircraft types and a contractual cost increase for b engine repairs 
air travel in our markets tends to be seasonal  with the highest levels occurring during the winter months to florida and the summer months to the northeastern and western united states 
the second quarter tends to be our strongest revenue quarter 
total operating expenses less aircraft fuel expense divided by asms 
non fuel operating cost per asm is a measure of unit operating costs which is not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many factors which are out of our control  therefore  we believe that non fuel operating cost per asm provides a useful measure of an airline s unit operating expense which facilitates an understanding of operating costs over time 
results of operations compared to summary during  we reported operating income of million  net income of million  and diluted earnings per common share of 
included in our results are gains on disposition of assets of million  a non operating gain on derivative financial instruments of million  and a non operating gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
due to the pronounced reduction in the average cost of jet fuel per gallon during compared to and the actions that we have undertaken  our operating results for the year were substantially improved compared to during  we reported an operating loss of million  a net loss of million  and diluted loss per common share of 
included in our results are gains on disposition of assets of million  an impairment charge to write off goodwill of million  and a non operating loss on derivative financial instruments of million 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the year ended december  decreased million percent due to the net effect of a million decrease in passenger revenues and a million increase in other revenues compared to the year ended december  our total revenue per available seat mile for the year ended december  was cents  a decrease of percent compared to the year ended december  we believe that our capacity reductions combined with increases in ancillary fees partially mitigated the unfavorable impact of current adverse macroeconomic conditions by preventing a more pronounced erosion of total unit revenues 
the million percent decrease in passenger revenue compared to was due to lower capacity  reduced traffic  and reduced passenger yield 
we believe the reductions in traffic and yield were attributable in large part to the weak air travel demand caused by adverse macroeconomic conditions 
during  we reduced our capacity  as measured by available seat miles asms  by percent compared to the reduction in capacity was primarily the intended consequence of actions we took in to defer aircraft deliveries and sell aircraft 
the reduced capacity coupled with a percent decrease in revenue passenger miles produced an average passenger load factor of percent  which was a percentage point increase compared to the year ended december  average yield per revenue passenger mile was cents  percent lower than the decrease in average yield was in part attributable to an increase in average length of passenger haul 
during  our average length of passenger haul increased percent  an increase in average length of passenger haul tends to increase average fare and tends to reduce average yield 
other revenues for the year ended december   increased million percent compared to the year ended december   reflecting in large part pricing changes for ancillary customer services resulting from the unbundling of our service product 
other revenues include change and cancellation fees  direct booking fees  revenues derived from the sale of frequent flyer credits  baggage fees  and other miscellaneous revenues 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the year ended december   decreased million percent and decreased percent on a unit cost basis  as measured by operating cost per asm casm compared to the year ended december  our financial results were significantly affected by the price of fuel and volatility of the price of fuel during the year ended december  the decrease in total operating costs per asm was the net result of a percent decrease in fuel cost per asm and a percent increase in non fuel operating cost per asm 
in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by available seat miles asms 
the following table summarizes our unit costs  as defined by casm  for the indicated periods year ended december  percent increase decrease aircraft fuel salaries  wages and benefits aircraft rent maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents aircraft insurance and security services marketing and advertising depreciation and amortization gain loss on disposition of assets impairment of goodwill other operating total casm aircraft fuel decreased percent on a cost per asm basis because jet fuel cost per gallon decreased 
during  our average fuel cost per gallon  including taxes and into plane fees  decreased percent from during to during during  we realized million in losses on fuel related derivative financial instruments which increased fuel expense 
salaries  wages and benefits expense increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to an increase in wage rates attributable to higher average employee seniority and lower employee attrition while asms declined by percent 
maintenance  materials and repairs expense increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to increases in the number and cost of airframe checks and rate increases in certain of our power by the hour maintenance agreements 
landing fees and other rents increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to increased landing fees and higher rental rates at various airports for gate and certain terminal space 
gain loss on disposition of assets for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
gain loss on disposition of assets pertains primarily to aircraft related transactions 
during  we recognized million loss for the write off of capitalized interest related to the release of our obligation to purchase two b aircraft which boeing sold to an unrelated foreign airline  and million gain related to the deposits we previously received from the potential buyer who defaulted on its obligation to purchase two b aircraft in the third quarter 
during  we sold eight b aircraft 
other income expense other income expense  net decreased by million to million net expense for compared to million net expense for other income expense  net includes interest income  interest expense  capitalized interest  net gains losses on derivative financial instruments  and gain on extinguishment of debt 
interest income increased by million from to million for primarily due to the net effects of the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates and a million gain classified as interest income upon the redemption of all of our investments in an enhanced cash investment fund 
during  we recorded a charge of million classified as interest income for realized and unrealized losses related to our investments in available for sale securities 
interest expense  including amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs  decreased by million from to million for the decrease was primarily due to the net effects of the following the favorable impact of lower interest rates applicable to variable interest rate debt due to declines in market interest rates  the repurchase of million of our convertible notes  interest on our convertible senior notes issued in may  interest associated with our credit facility obtained in the third quarter of  and interest on our convertible senior notes issued in october capitalized interest decreased by million from to million for capitalized interest represents the interest cost to finance purchase deposits for future aircraft 
these amounts are classified as part of the cost of the aircraft upon delivery 
we reported net gains on derivative financial instruments of million for  compared to a net loss of million for net gains losses on derivative financial instruments consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel related derivatives which either did not qualify for hedge accounting or were not designated as hedges for financial accounting purposes 
during  we repurchased million of our convertible notes resulting in a gain of million 
income tax expense benefit our effective income tax rate was percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate can differ from the percent composite statutory tax rate percent federal statutory rate plus the percent effective state tax rate due to changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  certain expenses which are not deductible for income tax purposes  and non recurring discrete items related to restricted stock vesting 
non deductible expense items and discrete items tend to increase the effective tax rate when pre tax income is reported and tend to decrease the effective tax rate when a pre tax loss is reported 
income tax benefits recorded on losses result in deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes 
we are required to provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to the extent management determines that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will ultimately not be realized 
we expect to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets including a portion of the deferred tax asset associated with loss carry forwards through the reversal of existing temporary differences 
however  we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in excess of our deferred tax liabilities will not ultimately be realized  in part due to our cumulative losses over the past three years  and that we are therefore required to provide a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in excess of our deferred tax liabilities 
as a result  beginning with the third quarter of  our losses were not reduced by any tax benefit 
consequently  our effective tax rate for was substantially lower than the statutory rate 
as of december  and  we had recorded million and million of valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets  respectively 
regardless of the financial accounting for income taxes  our net operating loss carry forwards are currently available for use on our income tax returns to offset future taxable income 
the income tax expense of million is primarily attributable to income tax expense associated with the repurchase of our convertible notes 
compared to summary we reported an operating loss of million  net loss of million  and loss per diluted common share of for included in our results were gains on the sale of assets of million  an impairment charge to write off goodwill of million and a non operating loss on derivative financial instruments of million 
the losses were attributable primarily to record high fuel prices during the first nine months of however  during the fourth quarter  jet fuel prices decreased dramatically and consequently we reported a fourth quarter operating profit of million in for  we recorded operating income of million  net income of million  and diluted earnings per common share of 
included in our results for are gains on the sale of aircraft of million  a million loss on derivative financial instruments  and the write off of million of expenses related to the attempted acquisition of midwest air group midwest airlines 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the year ended december  increased million percent  primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
total revenue per available seat mile increased percent to cents compared to as a result of stronger loads and increases in ancillary revenues 
the million percent increase in passenger revenues compared to was largely due to a percent increase in passenger traffic as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms 
average yield per rpm was cents  percent higher than the year ended december  during the year ended december   our average passenger length of haul increased percent  an increase in average passenger length of haul tends to increase average fare and tends to reduce average yield 
during  we moderated our growth by taking delivery of only eight b aircraft  selling eight b aircraft  and terminating early the lease of one b aircraft  bringing our total fleet to aircraft at year end 
while the aircraft fleet size was reduced by one unit  the average fleet size was percent higher in compared to as a result  our capacity  as measured by available seat miles asms  increased percent 
load factor increased to percent  percentage points higher than the prior year  resulting in a percent increase in passenger revenue per asm versus the year ended december  other revenues for increased million percent 
other revenues include change and cancellation fees  direct booking fees  revenues derived from the sale of frequent flyer credits  additional and excess baggage fees  and other miscellaneous revenues 
the increase in other revenues was attributable primarily to increases in direct booking fees  unaccompanied minor fees  change and cancellation fees  and baggage fees 
in late  we ceased offering cargo services 
other revenues for the year ended december  included million of cargo revenue 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million percent and increased percent on an operating cost per asm basis casm 
our financial results were significantly affected by the price of fuel and volatility of the price of fuel 
in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by asms 
the following table summarizes our unit costs  defined as operating expense per asm casm  for the indicated periods year ended december  percent increase decrease aircraft fuel salaries  wages and benefits aircraft rent maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents aircraft insurance and security services marketing and advertising depreciation and amortization gain loss on disposition of assets impairment of goodwill other operating total casm aircraft fuel increased percent on a cost per asm basis due to an increase in the average price of jet fuel per gallon 
during  our fuel price per gallon  including taxes and into plane fees  increased percent from during to during during  we realized million in gains from fuel related derivative financial instruments which reduced fuel expenses 
distribution expense increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to higher credit card fees paid to various credit card companies 
landing fees and other rents increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to facility rental rate increases by various airports 
aircraft insurance and security services expense decreased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to negotiated lower rates for hull and liability insurance 
marketing and advertising costs decreased percent on a cost per asm basis because our asms increased while our marketing and advertising costs were relatively unchanged 
depreciation and amortization increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily because a higher proportion of our fleet was owned during compared to also  additions to computer equipment and software increased depreciation and amortization expense 
gain loss on disposition of assets for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  gain loss on disposition of assets in each year consisted primarily of gains on aircraft sales 
during the years ended december  and  we sold eight and two b aircraft  respectively 
impairment of goodwill expense for the year ended december  was million 
because adverse industry conditions and our operating losses were indicators that our intangible assets may have been impaired  we prepared an assessment and concluded that all of our goodwill was impaired as of june   while our trademarks and trade names were not impaired 
consequently  we recorded a charge of million to write off the financial statement carrying value of all of our goodwill during other income expense other income expense  net increased by million to million for compared to million for other income expense  net includes interest income  interest expense  capitalized interest  net gains losses on derivative financial instruments  and other 
interest income decreased by million from million in to million in due to lower interest rates 
also  during  we recorded a million charge to interest income related to realized and unrealized losses on investments 
interest expense  including amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs  increased by million from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the net effects of the following the favorable impact of lower interest rates applicable to variable interest rate debt due to declines in market interest rates  the unfavorable impact of debt service for our convertible senior notes issued in may  the unfavorable impact of debt service for our credit facility obtained in  and a million charge related to debt issuance costs written off and prepayment penalties related to debt repayments associated with b aircraft sold during capitalized interest decreased by million from to million for capitalized interest represents the interest cost to finance purchase deposits for future aircraft 
these amounts are classified as part of the cost of the aircraft upon delivery 
we reported net losses on derivative financial instruments of million for  compared to losses of million for net gains losses on derivative financial instruments consisted primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel related derivatives which either did not qualify for hedge accounting or were not designated as hedges for financial accounting purposes 
other income expense for included million to write off the costs associated with the attempted acquisition of midwest airlines which was terminated in august income tax expense benefit our effective income tax rate was percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate can differ from the percent composite statutory tax rate percent federal statutory rate plus the percent effective state tax rate due to changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  certain expenses which are not deductible for income tax purposes  and non recurring discrete items related to restricted stock vesting 
during  we recorded an million charge to write off all of the carrying value of our goodwill 
because this write off was not deductible for income tax purposes  we did not record a tax benefit and consequently our effective tax rate was reduced 
we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in excess of our deferred tax liabilities would not ultimately be realized and that we were therefore required to provide a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in excess of our deferred tax liabilities 
as a result  beginning with the third quarter of  our losses were not reduced by any tax benefit 
consequently  our effective tax rate for was substantially lower than the statutory rate 
as of december   we had recorded million of valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had aggregate unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  and we also had million of restricted cash 
at december   we had million of borrowing outstanding under our revolving line of credit facility 
during  our primary sources of cash were cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of debt and equity securities  borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility  and borrowings to finance aircraft acquisitions 
our primary uses of cash were repayment of long term debt  repayment of borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility  and expenditures for the acquisition of two b aircraft 
as of february   we had no borrowing outstanding under our revolving line of credit facility and a million letter of credit had been issued under our letter of credit facility 
the letter of credit beneficiary was not entitled to draw any amounts as of february  in  we entered into amendments to a our letter of credit facility the letter of credit facility and revolving line of credit facility the revolving line of credit facility which combined facility we refer to as the credit facility and b our credit card processing agreements with our two largest credit card processors as measured by volume processed for us 
the credit facility was amended to extend the expiration date to december   increase the amount that may be borrowed under the revolving line of credit facility from million to million  and reduce the permitted maximum aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit plus outstanding borrowing under the credit facility from million to million 
each agreement with our two largest credit card processors based on volumes processed for us was amended in resulting in changes to contractual terms generally favorable to us 
our agreement with our largest credit card processor now expires december  during october  we completed a public offering of our convertible senior notes and a public offering of our common stock 
the net proceeds from these two public offerings aggregated million 
operating  investing  and financing activities operating activities in provided million of cash flow compared to million used in cash flow from operating activities is related to both the level of our profitability and changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 
operating cash inflows are largely attributable to revenues derived from the transportation of passengers 
operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for fuel  labor  aircraft rent  aircraft maintenance  marketing  and other activities 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december changes in the components of our working capital also impact cash flow from operating activities 
changes in the air traffic liability balance and the related accounts receivable balance have had a significant impact on our net cash flow from operating activities 
we have a liability to provide future air travel because travelers tend to purchase air transportation in advance of their intended travel date 
advance ticket sales  which are recorded as air traffic liability  fluctuate seasonally and also provide cash when we grow and consequently receive additional cash for future travel 
this historical source of cash will decline or change to a use to the extent our growth slows or reverses or the amounts held back by our credit card processors increase 
during  our air traffic liability balance decreased million  negatively impacting our net cash flow from operating activities 
during  our air traffic liability balance increased million  contributing to net cash flow from operating activities 
changes in accounts payable  accrued  and other current and non current liabilities also impact our cash flow from operating activities 
during  the million decrease in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities 
during  the million increase in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities contributed favorably to net cash flow from operating activities 
our derivative financial instruments reduced our cash flow provided by operating activities during by million 
cash flow from operations was reduced by million primarily due to payments to counterparties including amounts paid to unwind certain fuel related derivatives and changes in the fair value of derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments neither provide nor use cash until realized 
during  counterparties to our derivative financial instrument arrangements released deposits held by them as consequences of the unwinding of fuel related derivatives and the reduction of the value of our fuel related derivative financial instrument obligations 
the amount of deposits received from counterparties  net of amounts paid to counterparties  aggregated million during the year ended december  we used cash to increase other assets by million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
other assets include prepaid aircraft maintenance and other deposits  prepaid insurance  and prepaid distribution costs 
additionally  cash was used to increase prepaid and stored fuel by million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   cash was provided as we decreased prepaid and stored fuel by million 
investing activities in used million in cash compared to the million provided in purchases and sales of available for sales securities are classified as investing activities 
during  we sold million of available for sale securities 
during  we purchased million and sold million of available for sale securities 
investing activities also include expenditures for aircraft deposits and the purchase of aircraft and other property and equipment 
aircraft purchase contracts typically require that the purchaser make pre delivery deposits to the manufacturer 
these deposits are refunded at the time of aircraft delivery 
we may invest a portion or all of the refunded deposits in the aircraft 
during  we paid million in deposits and received million in previously paid deposits 
during  we paid million in deposits and received million in previously paid deposits 
during  we expended million in cash  primarily for the acquisition of two b aircraft as well as for the acquisition of rotable parts  buyer furnished equipment  and other property and equipment 
acquisitions of other property and equipment included additions to leasehold improvements and the purchase of ground and computer equipment 
during  we expended million in cash  primarily for the acquisition of eight b aircraft of which two were sold to a foreign airline as well as for the acquisition of rotable parts and other property and equipment 
financing activities provided million of cash during  compared to using cash of million during during october  we completed a public offering of million of our convertible senior notes due in and a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from the two offerings aggregated million  after deducting offering expenses  discounts and commissions paid to the underwriters 
the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including improving our overall liquidity 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  in principal amount of such notes which equals an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
in  our board of directors authorized  at management s discretion  the repurchase  from time to time  of up to million of our convertible notes in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated purchases 
during  we repurchased million of our convertible notes resulting in a gain of million 
repurchases pursuant to the board s authorization may be effected  suspended or terminated at any time  or from time to time at the discretion of management or the board of directors without prior notice and it is uncertain whether or not we will repurchase additional convertible notes 
during  we borrowed billion and repaid billion under our revolving line of credit facility 
also during  we borrowed million to finance aircraft acquisitions and repaid million of aircraft debt financing  including million for repayments of pre delivery deposit financing 
during the second quarter of  we completed two financings 
the proceeds were used to improve our overall liquidity and for general corporate purposes 
we completed a public offering of million of our convertible senior notes due we placed approximately million of the proceeds of such offering in an escrow account with a trustee 
in addition to the escrowed amount  we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting discounts and commissions paid to the underwriters and other expenses incurred with the offering 
funds in the escrow account are invested in government securities and are being used to make the first six scheduled semi annual interest payments on the notes  and these payments are secured by a pledge of the assets in escrow
