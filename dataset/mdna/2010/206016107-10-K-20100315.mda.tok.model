item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto located elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop  manufacture and market the essure permanent birth control system  an innovative and proprietary medical device for women 
the essure system delivers a soft and flexible insert into a woman s fallopian tubes  causing benign tissue in growth which blocks the fallopian tubes 
a successfully placed essure micro insert and the subsequent tissue growth prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tubes  preventing conception 
the effectiveness rate of the essure procedure determined in our clinical study is after four years of follow up 
we obtained approval to market essure in the european union in february and obtained the us food and drug administration  or fda  approval for essure in november over  women worldwide have undergone the essure procedure 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of conceptus sas  based in versailles  france 
as a result of this transaction  conceptus sas became a wholly owned subsidiary  and through it we sell essure directly in france and through a network of distributors throughout the rest of europe 
this acquisition expanded our presence in international markets and has increased our revenues as we now recognize sales at end user pricing 
on december   we incorporated conceptus medical limited cml as a wholly owned subsidiary in the united kingdom to serve as our direct sales office in the united kingdom after terminating our distributor relationship with our previous distributor during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents this incorporation further expanded our presence in international markets and has increased our revenues as we now recognize sales at end user pricing in united kingdom 
during we received a national institute for health and clinical excellence nice positive recommendation in the united kingdom and an approval for the essure procedure from the brazilian national health service 
during  we sold the essure system in twenty two countries 
for financial information about geographic areas and for segment information with respect to net sales  refer to the information set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the essure procedure the essure micro insert is designed to be placed into each fallopian tube during a single procedure using a hysteroscope  an instrument that allows visual examination of the cervix and uterine cavity  and our minimally invasive delivery system 
the delivery system is a disposable plastic handle that is connected to our proprietary guidewire and catheter system 
the micro insert is constructed of a stainless steel inner coil  a dynamic outer coil made from a nickel titanium alloy  called nitinol  and a layer of polyethylene terephthalate  or polyester fibers  wound between the inner coils 
using the hysteroscope for guidance  the delivery catheter is guided through the uterus and into the opening of the fallopian tube 
once the physician has properly positioned the delivery system in the fallopian tube  the physician releases the micro insert 
when released  the micro insert automatically expands to the contours of the fallopian tube and anchors itself in place 
over a three month time frame  the polyester fibers within the micro insert elicit a localized  benign tissue in growth that occludes  or blocks  the fallopian tubes  thereby preventing conception 
currently  local anesthesia is used as the predominate method of controlling discomfort during the essure procedure 
general anesthesia is not typically used unless required by hospital protocol  if requested by the patient  or based on the experience and comfort level of the physician 
the essure procedure can be performed in the comfort of a physician s office in less than ten minutes average hysteroscopic time without hormones  cutting  burning or the risks associated with general anesthesia or tubal ligation 
a patient is typically discharged approximately minutes after the essure procedure 
no overnight hospital stay is required 
furthermore  the essure procedure is effective without drugs or hormones 
there is a three month waiting period after the essure procedure is completed during which the patient must continue to use her current form of birth control or an alternative form while tissue in growth occurs 
after three months  us patients complete a confirmation test called a hysterosalpingogram  or hsg  which provides confirmation to both the doctor and the patient of the placement of the inserts and the occlusion of the fallopian tubes 
outside of the united states  the confirmation test is a standard flat plate pelvic x ray conducted three months after completion of the procedure  with a subsequent hsg if device location on the initial radiographic image appears suspicious 
critical accounting estimates and policies we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues material to our financial position and results of operations 
table of contents in future periods 
we believe our most critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation expense  allowance for doubtful accounts  cash  cash equivalents and investments  warranty obligation  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  debt  contingent liabilities  and income taxes 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily comprised of the sale of our essure system 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc asc revenue recognition 
under this standard  the following four criteria must be met in order to recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the four revenue recognition criteria are applied to our sales as described in the following paragraphs 
we recognize revenues from our essure system when title to the product and the risk of loss transfers to an external customer 
we do not accept returns of the essure system 
we obtain written authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and the price is not dependent on actual essure procedures performed 
for sales through distributors we recognize revenues from our essure system when title to the product and the risk of loss transfers to the distributor 
our distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  training and warranty for the essure system in their respective territories 
our standard terms and conditions do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributor to return or exchange the essure system and the distributor is obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of their ability to resell the product 
additionally  we require physicians to be preceptored between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant from inception to date 
we assess the credit worthiness of all customers in connection with their purchases 
we only recognize revenue when collectability is reasonably assured 

table of contents certain sales of our essure system may include delivery of additional items 
these obligations may be fulfilled after shipment of the essure system  and in these cases  we recognize revenue in accordance with the multiple element accounting guidance set forth in asc revenue multiple element arrangements 
when we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements we defer revenue attributable to the post shipment obligations and recognize such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise we defer all revenue until all elements are delivered 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation asc  using the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award which is computed using the black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions shown in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and the stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
the expected term of the options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the estimated life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  we account for the possibility that certain customers may not pay us by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our exposure to credit losses may change as we increase our receivables 
changes in customer type and mix  as well as domestic and international economic climate  will also impact potential credit losses 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  our increase in sales may result in a higher accounts receivable balance  which may require a higher balance in the allowance 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents cash  cash equivalents and investments we consider all highly liquid investments with maturity from date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain deposits with four financial institutions and invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate notes  municipal bonds and government securities  which bear minimal risk 
our cash and cash equivalents in our operating accounts are with third party financial institutions 
at times  these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
at december  short term investments consist of auction rate securities ars 
as of december   we held million par value in ars  backed by federal and state student loans which are variable rate debt instruments and bear interest rates that reset approximately every days 
these ars have a contractual maturity ranging from through our ars are short term debt instruments backed by student loans  a substantial portion of which are guaranteed by the united states government 
prior to  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every days  to provide liquidity at par 
we have experienced failed auctions in and on most of our ars 
the failures of these auctions do not affect the value of the collateral underlying the ars  and we continue to earn and receive interest on our ars at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes 
however  we had settlements of our ars in the twelve months ended december  of million at full par value 
see note short term investment and note fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag  providing us with rights related to our ars the rights 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june through july conversely  ubs has the right  at its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july  so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights at par value 
however  if the rights are not exercised before july they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
so long as we hold our ars  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
although the rights represent the right to sell the securities back to ubs at par  we will be required to periodically assess the economic ability of ubs to meet that obligation in assessing the fair value of the rights 
we have accounted for the rights as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value of the rights under the fair value option of asc financial instruments 
upon acceptance of the offer from ubs  we recorded approximately million as the fair value of the rights with a corresponding credit to other expense  net in the fourth quarter of as a result of our election to record the rights at fair value  unrealized gains and losses have been included in earnings 
we estimated the fair value of the rights using the expected value that we will receive from ubs which was calculated as the difference between the anticipated recognized loss and par value of the ars as of the option exercise date 
this value was discounted by using a ubs credit default rate to account for the consideration of ubs credit risk 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded an 
table of contents additional loss of million  respectively which represents the decrease in the fair value of the put option 
in the future we expect any changes in the fair value of our ars to be materially offset in part by changes in the fair value of our put option with ubs 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded our ars as available for sale investments 
we recorded unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets 
such an unrealized loss did not change net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
in connection with our acceptance of the ubs offer in november  resulting in our right to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value beginning on june  we transferred our ars from available for sale to trading securities in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities 
the transfer to trading securities reflected our intent to exercise our put option during the third quarter of prior to our agreement with ubs  our intent was to hold our ars until we realized the par value 
we recorded a temporary reduction in carrying value of million for the nine months ended september   which was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
upon transfer to trading securities  we transferred the million recorded as unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded an unrealized loss of million in other expense  net in the fourth quarter of  representing the difference between the par and fair value of the ars at the date of transfer 
we determined that use of a valuation model was the best available technique for measuring the fair value of our ars 
we used a trinomial discount model weighting estimated future cash flows  quality of collateral and the probability of future successful auctions occurring 
in determining a discount factor for each ars  the model weights various factors  including assessments of credit quality  duration  insurance wraps  portfolio composition  discount rates  overall capital market liquidity and comparable securities  if any 
in september we reclassified the ars and the associated put option from long term investments to short term investments because we intend to sell our ars under the rights at the inception of the rights period in the third quarter of additionally  in november  we entered into a revolving credit line agreement with ubs  payable on demand  in an amount equal to of fair value of our auction rate securities at net no cost  meaning that the interest we pay on the credit line will not exceed the interest that we receive on the ars that we have pledged as security for the credit line 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  if ubs is able to sell our ars at par  proceeds would be utilized to first repay any outstanding balance under the revolving credit line 
we are still able to sell the ars  but in such a circumstance  if we sold at less than par value  we would not be entitled to recover the par value support from ubs 
see note credit line in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
warranty obligation we provide for the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of goods sold 
we expect that warranty expense will increase as and if we increase our net sales 
warranty reserve rates may change if we change the manufacturing process or change our third party manufacturing contractors 
should actual costs differ from historical experience  increases in warranty expense may be required 
warranty reserves as of december  and were approximately million 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc property  plant and equipment 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our property and equipment  the patents acquired in connection with our purchase of the intellectual property assets from ovion inc  and intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of conceptus sas in  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
see note goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
such events or circumstances include a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december  and included property and equipment of million and million  respectively  and other identifiable intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations 
we have recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of conceptus sas in under asc intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment annually  or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
we operate as one reporting unit engaged in developing  manufacturing  and marketing medical devices 
we assess goodwill impairment indicators quarterly  or more frequently  if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the first step of the impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  the second step determines the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized only when the calculated fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  is less than its carrying amount 
we performed an annual assessment during the fourth quarter of of our goodwill at the reporting unit level 
no impairment charges have been recorded through december  other intangible assets include patents  customer relationships  license agreements and non compete agreements 
they are amortized using the straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives 
debt we account for our convertible senior notes in accordance with asc derivative and hedging asc 
in this regard  our convertible debt and net share settlement feature does not fall under the category of a derivative  and consequently  we classify our long term debt as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
our convertible hedge and our outstanding warrants are accounted as set 
table of contents forth by asc  through which we record the convertible hedge transaction and the warrants in additional paid in capital 
subsequent changes in fair value of the agreement are not recognized 
in addition  we account for the cost issuance of debt in accordance with asc interest asc 
consequently  these costs were recognized as an asset and are amortized by periodic charges to income 
asc debt with conversion and other options asc clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement 
asc specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflect the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate which interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and retrospective application is required for all periods presented 
we adopted asc in the first quarter of fiscal contingent liabilities we account for contingencies in accordance with asc contingencies asc 
asc requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate 
nevertheless  the actual loss from a loss contingency might differ from our estimates 
income taxes on january   we adopted the provisions of asc income taxes asc 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the adoption of the provisions of asc did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
due to experiencing only a short history of profitability  management believes that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
management reviews its assumptions regarding the realization of deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
continued profitability and future changes in management s assumptions may result in a partial or full release of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
a release of the valuation allowance would have a favorable impact on the tax provision within the statement of operations 

table of contents our net deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards generated before we achieved profitability 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the recorded domestic cumulative net losses we have provided a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain valuation allowances until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
under certain conditions related to our future profitability and other business factors  we believe it is possible our results will yield sufficient positive evidence to support the conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefit of our net operating losses 
if that is the case  subject to review of other qualitative factors and uncertainties  we would expect to begin reversing the remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a reduction of tax expense 
for the periods following the recognition of this tax benefit and to the extent we are profitable  we will record a tax provision for which the actual payment may be offset against our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards 
however  our tax rate may significantly increase in future periods 
results of operations results compared to in thousands  except percentages years ended december  a change amount b amount b net sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses net income loss a adjusted for retrospective adoption of asc see note convertible senior notes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
b expressed as a percentage of total net sales 
net sales net sales were million for as compared to million for  representing an increase of approximately million or 
the increase is primarily the result of continued commercialization and marketing of the essure procedure worldwide and reflects the increasing numbers of physicians entering and completing training in the use of the procedure 
the increase also reflects the continuation of our programs aimed at raising consumer awareness of the essure procedure  such as radio  print and television advertising 
international sales comprised of our total sales in and revenue from international sales increased in as compared to this increase reflects continued growth at conceptus sas france and the establishment of conceptus medical ltd in the united kingdom 
additionally  international sales were positively impacted by the increased number of global distributors in 
table of contents net sales by geographic region  based on shipping location of our customer  are as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  net sales in thousands united states of america france europe other than france other for the years ended december  and  we had no customers that accounted for greater than of our net sales 
one customer accounted for of our total gross outstanding accounts receivable as of december  we had no customers who had an outstanding accounts receivable balance greater than of our total gross outstanding accounts receivable as of december  we expect our net sales for to be in the range of approximately million to million  which would represent to growth from net sales in as we continue to increase the number of physicians performing the essure procedure 
we will also continue our programs aimed at raising consumer awareness of the essure procedure 
we believe our revenue growth in and beyond will be significantly influenced by how successful we are in achieving enhanced consumer and physician awareness 
however  as we have noted elsewhere and in the risk factors in this report  our expected revenue growth involves many risks  many of which are not entirely within our control 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in this increase was caused by higher volumes of sales 
the gross profit margin was for compared with for the year over year increase in gross margin is related to lower manufacturing costs associated with higher unit volume and a domestic price increase implemented during the first quarter of additionally  during the third quarter of  we entered into an asset purchased agreement with american medical systems  inc ams pursuant to which we acquired the intellectual property assets  including patents and licenses from ovion inc ovion  a wholly owned subsidiary of ams 
in connection with the purchase agreement  ams and ovion released us from any and all current and future domestic and international royalty obligations under such licenses 
we released an accrual of approximately million related to previously accrued international royalty obligations  which contributed approximately in our gross profit margins for the acquisition of these intellectual property assets secured complete ownership over the use and further development of the essure system 
we believe that our gross profit margin will continue to benefit from this asset purchase because amounts that would have been previously recorded as royalty expense would have been greater than amounts that will be recorded as amortization of the acquired assets 
our gross profit margin will vary as our sales mix changes 
increases in sales of our devices through distributors in international markets will tend to decrease our overall gross profit margin 
research and development research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in  which represents an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses for and represented and  respectively 

table of contents the primary reason for the increase is due to higher costs resulted to develop and test prototypes for the next generation devices  increased cost for tools and supplies  and higher clinical trials related expenses of approximately million 
this increase was partially offset by a million decreases related to payroll  stock compensation and consulting expenses 
research and development expenses reflect product development  clinical research and regulatory affairs  which are substantially related to the ongoing development and associated regulatory approvals of our technology 
our goal is to continue our product enhancements over the coming years  which are intended to result in improved ease of use and clinical performance 
we expect to identify and hire additional research and development personnel in the future to staff our planned research and development activities  and we expect that these costs will increase as we seek to maintain our leading position in the market for permanent female birth control 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for were million as compared to million for  which represents an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses for and were and  respectively 
the increases were the result of payroll  consulting personnel expenses  and stock compensation expenditures of approximately million 
advertising expenditures increased by million primarily for our consumer awareness campaigns 
the increase also reflects the following increased rent  insurance and sales taxes related expenses of approximately million  increased costs related to marketing materials and research of approximately million  increased banking fees of approximately million  increased audit and tax related fees of approximately million  increased travel related expenses of approximately million  an increase in bad debt expense of approximately million  and increased supplies  freight and maintenance of approximately million 
interest income and expense and other expenses  net total interest income and expenses and other expenses for was a net expense of million as compared to a net expense of million for  which represents an increase of million or 
interest income for was lower by million compared to  primarily as a result of lower interest rates on our investment portfolio  which consists of auction rate securities and money market funds that are currently earning lower interest rates compared to interest expense in was million higher than  primarily due to the interest on our revolving credit line with ubs

in may  fasb issued asc  which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement 
asc specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflect the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate which interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods

provision benefit for income taxes we adopted the provisions of asc  on january  the adoption of asc with respect to uncertain tax positions did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of 
table of contents operations 
we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or any state income or franchise tax agency 
as of december   our federal returns for the years ended through the current period and most state returns for the years ended through the current period are still open to examination 
the tax returns of conceptus sas for the years ended to were examined and closed by the french tax authorities in in addition  all of the net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are still subject to inquiry given that the statute of limitation for these items would begin in the year of the utilization 
in we recorded a provision for income taxes of million 
our effective tax rate was for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december  was approximately million  of which  if ultimately recognized  approximately million would decrease the effective tax rate in the period in which the benefit is recognized 
the remaining amount would be offset by the reversal of related deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance is placed 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
in connection with the adoption of asc  we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance

the tax returns for conceptus sas for the years ended to were examined and closed by the french tax authorities 
as of december   we also recorded approximately million of income tax expense attributable to conceptus sas

asc became the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the historical gaap hierarchy was eliminated and the asc became the only level of authoritative gaap  other than guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission

asc will impact financial statements on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
some of the changes  such as the accounting for contingent consideration  may introduce more volatility into our earnings and may impact our acquisition strategy 
additionally  in february fasb issued an amendment to asc which amends the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination under asc asc consolidations asc changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which are re characterized as non controlling interests and classified as a component of equity 
asc is applied prospectively and asc requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests  while the remaining requirements of asc are applied prospectively 
asc and asc became effective on january  we adopted asc and asc in the first quarter of fiscal and their adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
effective january   we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc with respect to its financial assets and liabilities 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and provides for expanded disclosure about fair value measurements 
asc applies prospectively to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
asc excludes certain leasing transactions accounted for under asc  leases asc 
asc defers the effective date of asc for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years

in may  fasb issued asc  debt with conversion and other options asc 
on january   we adopted the cash conversion subsections of asc  which clarify the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion 
asc clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement 
asc specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflect the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate which interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and retrospective application is required for all periods presented 
we have accounted for this change in accounting principal by retrospectively adjusting prior period financial statements  including those set forth herein 
in april  fasb issued asc financial instruments asc and asc interim reporting or asc 
asc and asc requires us to disclose on a quarterly basis  providing quantitative and qualitative information about fair value estimates for all financial instruments not measured in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value

in addition  
table of contents increased disclosures are required for both debt and equity securities regarding expected cash flows  credit losses  and an aging of securities with unrealized losses 
asc is effective for interim and annual reporting periods that end after june  we have adopted the provisions of asc effective the second quarter of fiscal we have considered the guidance provided by asc in our determination of impairment  and have determined that the impact was not material 
see note convertible senior notes to consolidated financial statements 
in april  fasb issued asc fair value measurement and disclosure asc 
asc provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
asc re emphasizes that regardless of market conditions the fair value measurement is an exit price concept 
asc clarifies and includes additional factors to consider in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset or liability and provides additional clarification on estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset or liability has declined significantly 
the scope of asc does not include assets and liabilities measured under level inputs 
asc is applied prospectively to all fair value measurements where appropriate and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  we have adopted the provisions of asc effective the second quarter of fiscal  and have determined that the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  or level  a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
the updated guidance also requires that and entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant cumulative operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we were profitable during  we cannot assure you that we can maintain profitability 
we will continue to expend substantial resources in the selling and marketing of the essure system worldwide 
we will be in an accumulated deficit position unless sufficient revenues can be generated to offset expenses 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  the increase of million is primarily due to cash proceeds from operating and financing activities offset by cash used in investing activities as explained below 
as of december   we also held million par value in auction rate securities ars backed by federal and state student loans which are variable rate debt instruments and bear interest rates that reset approximately every days 
these ars have a contractual maturity ranging from through our ars are short term debt instruments 
prior to  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  
table of contents typically every days  to provide liquidity at par 
we have experienced failed auction in and on most of our ars 
the failures of these auctions do not affect the value of the collateral underlying the ars  and we continue to earn and receive interest on our ars at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag  providing us with the rights to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june through july conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july  so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights at par value in june however  if the rights are not exercised before july they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
so long as we hold our ars  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails 
we had settlements of our ars in of million at full par value 
ubs s obligations under the rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the successful achievement of our business objectives may require additional financing and therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our sales and marketing activities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including  among others resources devoted to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the liquidity of auction rate securities held in our investment portfolio  the rate of product adoption by doctors and patients  our determination to acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses  the market price of our common stock as it affects the exercise of stock options and the conversion terms of our convertible debt  and the insurance payer community s acceptance of and reimbursement for the essure procedure

the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share  in certain circumstances 
upon conversion  a holder would receive cash up to the principal amount of the note and our common stock in respect of such note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount

in addition  in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions and separate warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes call spread transactions

ubs line of credit in november  we entered into a revolving credit line agreement with ubs  payable on demand  in an amount equal to of fair value of our ars at net no cost  meaning that the interest we pay on the credit line will not exceed the interest that we receive on the ars that we have pledged as security for the credit line 
additionally  under the terms of the settlement agreement  if ubs is able to sell our ars at par value  proceeds would be utilized to first repay any outstanding balance under the demand revolving credit line

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we have been exposed to interest rate risk through interest earned on holdings of available for sale and trading marketable securities 
we have experienced failed auctions in and of most all of our ars and there is no assurance that auctions on these ars in our investment portfolio will succeed in the future 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investments in the near term may be limited  and our ability to fully recover the carrying value of our investments may be limited or non existent 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not carry out the transaction 
if the issuers of these securities are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record further impairment charges on these investments 
it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
as of december  we held million par value in ars which are variable rate debt instruments and bear interest rates that are due to reset approximately every days 
in september we re classified the ars from long term investments to short term investments because our intention is to sell our ars under the rights at par value at the inception of the rights period in the third quarter of due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
interest rates that may affect these items in the future will depend on market conditions and may differ from the rates we have experienced in the past 
a hypothetical percent change in interest rate will not have a material impact on our cash balance 
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our net sales are denominated in the euro and the british pound 
to date the foreign currency exchange risk related to british pounds has been minimal due to the size of conceptus medical limited 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to translation gains or losses which are recorded net as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk through operational means  including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency expenses  and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 
periodically  during we entered into forward contracts to buy u 
s dollars at fixed intervals in the retail market in an over the counter environmeant 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts to sell million euros in exchange for million maturing in january through april as of december  these forward contracts are recorded at their fair value of million in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have outstanding short term intercompany receivables of million as of 
table of contents december  we expect the changes in the fair value of the intercompany receivables to be materially offset by the changes in the fair value of the forward contracts 
the purpose of these forward contracts is to minimize the risk associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we have developed a foreign exchange policy to govern our forward contracts 
these foreign currency contracts do not qualify as cash flow hedges and all changes in fair value are reported in earnings as part of other income and expenses 
we have not entered into any other types of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purpose 
our foreign currency forward contract valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data and do not involve management judgment 
in  we assumed a forward exchange contract to hedge us dollar denominated estimated accounts payable in in connection with the acquisition of conceptus sas 
we recorded the changes of the fair value of the hedge contract in our results of operations in the hedge contract was fully utilized by december  at december   our intercompany receivable balance with foreign subsidiaries is million  with conceptus sas whose functional currency is euro  and the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar local currency exchange rate would be approximately million
