item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
the adverse impact of the current worldwide economic environment on the demand for cruises could adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the demand for cruises is affected by international  national and local economic and business conditions 
the current worldwide economic environment  including high unemployment rates  the volatility in the price of fuel and declines in the securities  real estate and other markets  has had an adverse effect on vacationers discretionary income and consumer confidence 
this  in turn  has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns  decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for the others in the cruise industry 
while we have recently begun to discern improvements in the current economic environment  we cannot predict the extent or strength of these improvements 
if the current environment worsens  we could experience a prolonged period of booking slowdowns  depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 
this could adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition including the impairment of the value of our ships  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 
to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations  drawdowns under available credit facilities  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets 
the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the current economic environment is adversely impacting our cash flows from operations 
the disruption of the credit markets in and resulted in a lack of liquidity worldwide 
a recurrence of these events may affect our ability to successfully raise capital or to do so on acceptable terms 
these factors may prevent us from having sufficient available capital or financing to meet our needs or to do so on acceptable terms 
in addition  our senior debt credit rating is currently bb with a negative outlook by standard and poor s and ba with a negative outlook by moody s and our corporate credit rating is ba with a negative outlook by moody s 
there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered further 
the lowering of our credit ratings may increase our cost of financing and can make it more difficult for us to access the financial markets 
we will be required to secure allure of the seas if at the time we draw down on our loan to purchase the vessel our senior debt is rated below bb by standard poor s or below ba by moody s 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 
the economic events during and  including failures of financial service companies and the related liquidity crisis  disrupted the capital and credit markets 
a recurrence of these disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them 
this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices  interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements 
if this occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations  results of operations and financial condition 
the increase in capacity resulting from delivery of newbuilds currently on order within the cruise industry could further adversely impact the demand for cruises or cruise pricing 
a total of new ships are on order for delivery through in the cruise industry  four of which are ours 
the current worldwide economic environment has led to lower cruise prices and lower onboard purchases  all of which have adversely affected our revenues 
the further growth in capacity from these new ships  without an increase in the cruise industry s share of the vacation market  could further depress cruise prices and compound our ability to achieve yield improvement 
we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market 
we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation 
we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines  but also to other vacation operators  which provide other leisure options including hotels  resorts and package holidays and tours 
we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing  travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to passengers 
our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation plc  which owns  among others  aida cruises  carnival cruise lines  costa cruises  cunard line  holland america line  iberocruceros  p o cruises and princess cruises  disney cruise line  msc cruises  norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 
in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies or our competitors offer travel agents higher commission rates and incentives in the future  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
fears of terrorist and pirate attacks  war  and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
events such as terrorist and pirate attacks  war  and other hostilities and the resulting political instability  travel restrictions  the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety  health and security aspects of traveling have had  and could have in the future  a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry 
these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and  therefore  increase our shipboard employee costs 
incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and results of operations 
the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents  illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety  health  security and vacation satisfaction and create a perception that cruising is more dangerous than other vacation alternatives 
incidents involving cruise ships  adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on future industry performance 
environmental  health and safety  financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 
the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies  such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels  increasing fuel efficiency requirements or further restricting emissions that could increase our cost for fuel and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry 
an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs  but also some of our other expenses  such as crew travel  freight and commodity prices 
in addition  initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced or are being considered in several european countries  and numerous bills related to climate change have been introduced in the united states 
although not all are likely to become law  it is apparent that future legislation related to climate change could likely impact all businesses including the cruise industry and adversely impact our costs 
some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 
in addition  we are subject to various international  national  state and local laws  regulations and treaties that govern  among other things  safety standards applicable to our ships  health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers  security standards on board our ships and at the ship port interface areas  and financial responsibilities to our passengers 
these issues are  and we believe will continue to be  an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world 
this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 
conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks 
we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence 
operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks 
examples include unstable local political or economic conditions and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising  vacation or maritime businesses  or governing the operations of foreign based companies 
additional risks include currency fluctuations  interest rate movements  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
if we are unable to address these risks adequately  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros 
while we have entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts  we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged 
if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract  any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated 
termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 
our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 
historically our focus has been to serve the north american cruise market  which continues to be our primary source of cruise passengers 
we have expanded our focus to increase our international passenger sourcing  most recently  in the brazilian  asian and australian markets 
expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment 
there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets  and if we do not  we may be unable to recover our investment  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order 
the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks 
delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships 
we have  for example  experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future 
these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue  increased operating expenses  or both  and thus adversely affect our results of operations 
the current worldwide economic environment is resulting in financial difficulties for shipyards and their subcontractors 
this may cause or result in delivery delays  ship cancellations or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the current worldwide economic environment is causing a loss of business for shipyards and their subcontractors which could result in financial difficulties  liquidations or closures 
these events could adversely affect the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and refurbish our existing fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations 
delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations  as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 
our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 
our operating costs  including fuel  food  payroll  airfare for our shipboard personnel  insurance and security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control 
increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  the recent volatility in the price of fuel is making our ability to predict fuel prices extremely difficult 
united states  state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes 
any such tax increases could also cause an increase in our costs 
unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation 
the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  existing capacity constraints  security concerns  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  financial limitations on port development  exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors  local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists 
any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 
price increases for commercial airline service for our passengers or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our passengers 
many of our passengers depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark 
increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our passengers which may adversely impact demand for our cruises 
in addition  changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our passenger s ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our passengers to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 
changes or disruptions to the travel agency industry could adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships 
if the current economic environment continues for an extended period of time or worsens  these agencies could be adversely impacted and significant disruptions or contractions could occur to these businesses 
this could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises 
if these events were to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
a disruption in our shoreside business may adversely affect our results of operations 
our principal executive office and shoreside operations are located at the port of miami  florida and we have large call centers for reservations in springfield  oregon  wichita  kansas and addlestone  england 
although we have developed disaster recovery and similar contingency plans  actual or threatened natural disasters ie hurricanes  earthquakes  tornados  fires  floods  information systems failure or similar events in these locations may have a material impact to our business continuity and results of operations 
further  we do not carry business interruption insurance for the majority of our shoreside operations 
as such  any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
failure to develop the value of our brands and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends on the strength and continued development of our cruise brands and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies 
our brands have the ability to expand and target the markets in which they operate which is critical to increasing our customer base 
failure to protect and differentiate our brands from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations 
the loss of key personnel  our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained collective bargaining relationships could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends  in large part  on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees  and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees 
we must continue to recruit  retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth 
furthermore  as of december   of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements 
a loss of key employees or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 
a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code  or other jurisdictions  may have adverse effects on our income 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business and or from sources within the united states 
drinker biddle reath llp  our united states tax counsel  has delivered to us an opinion  based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it  to the effect that this income  to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships  is exempt from united states federal income tax pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 
it should also be noted that the provisions of section are subject to change at any time by legislation 
moreover  changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity  residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders  or relevant foreign tax laws  that could affect our eligibility for the section exemption 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future 
if we were not entitled to the benefit of section  we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships  which would reduce our net income 
see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section finally  changes in the income tax laws affecting our operations in malta  spain  the united kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being charged against our operations  resulting in lower net income 
we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies  management and actions requiring shareholder approval 
as of february   a 
wilhelmsen as  a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway  owned approximately of our common stock and cruise associates  a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and a trust primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family  owned approximately of our common stock 
a sale of shares by a 
wilhelmsen as 
or cruise associates could cause a drop in our share prices 
a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders agreement which provides that they will each vote their shares for the election of four nominees of a 
wilhelmsen as  four nominees of cruise associates and our chief executive officer 
our articles of incorporation require that during the term of the shareholders agreement the approval of at least one director nominated by a 
wilhelmsen as 
and one director nominated by cruise associates is required for certain corporate actions 
as such  a 
wilhelmsen as and cruise associates have the power to determine  among other things our policies  the persons who will be our officers  and actions requiring shareholder approval 
a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business  subject to certain exceptions 
if any person other than a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates acquires ownership of more than of our common stock and our two principal shareholders  in the aggregate  own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect  or to designate for election  at least a majority of the board of directors  we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities  which we may be unable to replace on similar terms 
if this were to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 
we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 
our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and by laws and by the business corporation act of liberia 
the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states 
however  while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes  there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia 
as such  the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions 
for example  the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions 
there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments 
thus  our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management  directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 
litigation  enforcement actions  fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and or damage our reputation 
our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions  fines  civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages 
in addition  improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties  including substantial monetary fines 
in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and or a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter 
such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

item legal proceedings in january  we reached a settlement with rolls royce  co producer of the mermaid pod propulsion system on celebrity cruises millennium class ships  in our lawsuit pending in the circuit court for miami dade county  florida against rolls royce for the recurring mermaid pod failures 
under the terms of the settlement  we will receive payments of approximately million  net of costs and payments to insurers  of which million will be payable within five years 
as part of the settlement  each party has agreed to the dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice and to release the other from all claims and counterclaims made by each party against the other 
this award will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of within other expense income 
the miami district office of the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc has alleged that certain of our shipboard employment practices do not comply with united states employment laws 
in june  the eeoc proposed payment of monetary sanctions of approximately million and certain remedial actions 
following discussions with the eeoc regarding this matter  the eeoc informed us in april that they transferred the matter to its legal unit for litigation review 
to date  no legal proceedings have been initiated 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims and  if proceedings are initiated  we intend to vigorously pursue them 
in  the office of the attorney general of florida initiated an investigation to determine whether there had been a violation of florida or federal anti trust laws in connection with the imposition of supplemental charges for fuel implemented by a number of cruise lines 
the attorney general sought and received documentary information from the company 
in february  the company was informed that the attorney general has no plans to take any further action 
in january  a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that we and certain other named cruise lines infringed rights in copyrighted works and other intellectual property by presenting performances on our cruise ships without securing the necessary licenses 
in march  the court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim with sufficient particularity but granted leave to re file 
in april plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with substantially the same allegations as the original complaint except that it no longer seeks class action treatment and confines its allegations of infringement to plaintiffs copyrights of the theatrical production of grease 
the suit seeks payment of damages against all named defendants in an undetermined amount of not less than million  as well as disgorgement of profits  a permanent injunction against future infringement and punitive and treble damages 
we have filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint or  alternatively  to sever and transfer the case to the united states district court for the southern district of florida 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims which we will continue to vigorously pursue 
in july  three purported class actions were filed in united states district court for the eastern district of michigan against park west galleries  inc  doing business as park west gallery  pwg florida  inc  fine art sales  inc  vista fine art llc  doing business as park west at sea together  park west  and other named and unnamed parties  including royal caribbean cruises ltd 
and celebrity cruises inc and other unaffiliated cruise line companies 
the actions are being brought on behalf of purchasers of artwork at shipboard art auctions conducted by park west on the named cruise lines 
all three actions were subsequently transferred to the united states district court for the western district of washington and are no longer being brought on a class action basis 
also pending in the western district of washington as a result of transfer are two other actions against park west and other unaffiliated cruise line companies that  after being transferred  were amended to add royal caribbean cruises ltd 
and celebrity cruises inc as defendants 
one of these actions is being brought on a class action basis 
the substance of the claims in all five actions is virtually the same 
the suits allege that the artwork park west sells is not what it represents to its customers and that royal caribbean cruises ltd  celebrity cruises inc and other named cruise lines are complicit in the activities of park west  including engaging in a conspiracy with park west in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico  and are being enriched unjustly from the sale of the artwork 
the actions seek from the named defendants refund and restitution of all monies acquired from the sale of artwork at shipboard auctions  recovery for the amount of payments for the purchased artwork  damages on the rico claims in an indeterminate amount  permitted statutory damages and unspecified equitable or injunctive relief 
the suits also seek from certain non royal caribbean parties additional statutory  breach of contract and breach of warranty damages in unspecified amounts 
the suits are at their very early stages of litigation  however  we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us and we intend to vigorously pursue them 
in september  demands for arbitration were made under our collective bargaining agreement covering celebrity cruises crewmembers on behalf of twenty current and or former celebrity cruises cabin stewards and others similarly situated the september demands 
these demands contend that between and celebrity cruises improperly required the named cabin stewards to share guest gratuities with assistant cabin stewards 
the demands seek payment of damages  including penalty wages  under the us seaman s wage act of approximately million for the named crewmembers and estimates damages in excess of million  for the entire class of other similarly situated crewmembers 
in october  and again in december  additional demands for arbitration were made under our collective bargaining agreement covering celebrity cruises crewmembers by the same counsel on behalf of a total of three current and or former celebrity cruises cabin stewards and others similarly situated  making the same contentions and seeking the same damages as in the september demands 
a similar action brought by this same counsel in october on behalf of ten crew members and others similarly situated in the southern district court  southern district of florida making the same contentions and seeking the same damages as the arbitration demands was dismissed with prejudice 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the pending arbitration demands which we intend to vigorously pursue 
we are routinely involved in other claims typical within the cruise vacation industry 
the majority of these claims are covered by insurance 
we believe the outcome of such claims  net of expected insurance recoveries  will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

under the accrual in advance method  estimated drydocking costs are accrued evenly over the period to the next scheduled drydock 
under the deferral method  drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock 
the deferral method is preferable because it only recognizes the liability when incurred and does not require the use of estimates inherent in the accrual in advance method
