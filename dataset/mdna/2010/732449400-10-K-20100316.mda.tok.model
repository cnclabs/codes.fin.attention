item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion of results of operations and liquidity and capital resources contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as described under the heading important information regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and in the section above entitled risk factors 
unless otherwise indicated  all common stock related amounts have been adjusted to reflect our one for six reverse stock split effective september  critical accounting policies impairment of long lived and intangible assets as of december   we had net facilities and equipment of approximately million and a net intangible asset of approximately million  which represents capitalized payments for our picoplatin license 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we estimate the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on events or circumstances  such as changes in our business strategy and plans  a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in asset condition or a significant adverse change in regulatory climate 
specifically  the value of the picoplatin intangible asset could be impaired as a result of negative results of clinical trials or as a result of adverse decisions or rulings of regulatory bodies  such as the fda 
application of the test for impairment requires significant judgment  taking into account potentially unfavorable factors  such as those mentioned above  that could adversely affect the carrying value of the asset 
in march  we recognized an asset impairment loss of million on certain facilities and equipment resulting from the discontinuation of the company s preclinical research operations 
the loss on these assets was determined based on estimates of potential sales values of used equipment and other selling costs 
additionally  at december   we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million for our dedicated manufacturing equipment asset 
the impairment charge was determined based on the delay in our plans for the commercialization of picoplatin  which we do not anticipate will occur before long term debt on september   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement loan agreement  with ge business financial services formerly known as merrill lynch capital and silicon valley bank that provided for a senior secured term loan facility of million 
the loan agreement contains covenants requiring the company to maintain unrestricted cash in an amount equal to the lesser of i million or ii the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the term loans plus million 
we use judgment to determine our compliance with the minimum cash covenant and other covenants under the loan agreement 
we classify the portion of the loan that is due for payment in as a current liability and the portion due thereafter as a long term payable 
stock compensation we account for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards for equity instruments exchanged for services  which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values 
stock options we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options  however  have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options 
for example  employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
we use historical data  and other related information  as appropriate  to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of a grant 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
restricted stock units rsus we award rsus  which are exchangeable for our common shares upon vesting 
we use the closing market price of our common stock on the award date to estimate the fair value of awarded rsus 
for rsus that contain performance based vesting or vesting based on the achievement of defined milestones  we use judgment to determine the probability of achievement of a milestone to determine whether compensation should be recognized 
for rsus with milestones probable of achievement  we estimate the probable date of achievement and recognize compensation over the resulting implied service period 
results of operations years ended december   and research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in and increased to million in our research and development expenses are summarized as follows in thousands annual percentage change research contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and external laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidate  picoplatin  including formulation and in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses decreased to million in due to the discontinuation of our research operations effective march  research expenses increased to million in  largely as a result of higher personnel and laboratory supply costs  offset by reduced outside laboratory costs 
contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials  in addition to drug product stability and toxicology studies 
contract manufacturing costs increased to million in  primarily due to higher drug production and scale up costs 
contract manufacturing costs increased to million in  primarily due to slightly higher personnel costs 
clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs  including clinical research organization charges  principal investigator fees  clinical site expenses and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials 
clinical expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  such as storage and shipment services for our picoplatin drug product 
clinical costs decreased to million in  primarily due to reduced external clinical trial costs from the winding down of our trials  partially offset by costs from the increased use of consultants and contract labor 
clinical costs increased to million in  principally due to expanded external clinical trial costs associated with our picoplatin trials and increased personnel costs 
prior to  we included external legal costs associated with patent filings  maintenance and litigation in clinical expenses 
we now report patent related external legal costs in our general and administrative 
for the years ended  and  these costs totaled approximately million in each year 
the table above has been adjusted for this change in presentation 
share based compensation expenses reflect the non cash charge recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for share based compensation under which the fair value of all employee and non employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the share based awards 
share based compensation expense increased to million in this increase was primarily a result of recognition of expense for restricted stock unit awards  partially offset by the departure of an officer at the end of for whom there was no expense in  the expense of vesting of certain options held by certain officers in for which there was no similar acceleration in  and a lower number and value of stock options outstanding in reflecting lower staffing levels 
share based compensation expense increased to million in  primarily due to a higher number and value of outstanding stock options reflecting higher staffing levels 
our major research and development program during the years ended december   and was picoplatin 
picoplatin is an intravenous platinum based chemotherapeutic  designed to treat solid tumors that are resistant to existing platinum based cancer therapies 
we have completed enrollment and initial statistical analysis of a pivotal phase spear trial of picoplatin in the second line treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer 
this trial did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival and we have initiated a process with the fda to identify a potential regulatory path forward for picoplatin in this indication 
we are also conducting two separate phase trials evaluating picoplatin as a first line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and castration resistant hormone refractory prostate cancer 
additionally  we have completed a phase cardiac safety trial of picoplatin and a phase study evaluating an oral formulation of picoplatin in solid tumors 
as of december   we have incurred external costs of approximately million in connection with our entire picoplatin clinical program 
total estimated future costs of our picoplatin phase trial in small cell lung cancer is in the range of million to million through total estimated future costs of both our picoplatin phase trial in colorectal cancer and our phase trial in castration resistant prostate cancer are in the range of million to million through these future costs reflect activities to complete our trials through data analysis and data lock and could be substantially higher if we have to repeat  revise or expand the scope of any of our trials 
material cash inflows relating to the commercialization of picoplatin will not commence unless and until we complete required clinical studies and obtain fda marketing approvals  and then only if picoplatin finds acceptance in the marketplace 
to date  we have not received any revenues from sales of picoplatin 
recap of development and clinical program costs 
our research and development administrative overhead costs  consisting of rent  utilities  consulting fees and other various overhead costs  are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
our total research and development costs include the costs of various research efforts directed toward the identification and evaluation of future product candidates 
these other research projects are preclinical and not considered major projects 
we implemented a restructuring on march   which resulted in the discontinuation of our preclinical research operations 
our total research and development costs are summarized below in thousands annual percentage change picoplatin other unallocated costs and overhead share based compensation total research and development costs our external costs for picoplatin in  and reflect costs associated with our various picoplatin clinical studies and the manufacture of drug product to support our clinical trials 
we expect our external costs for picoplatin to decrease in  reflecting lower costs for our fully enrolled small cell lung  colorectal and prostate cancer trials and our completed oral picoplatin study  partially offset by clinical  consulting and other development costs associated with our regulatory and partnering activities focused on the continued development of picoplatin in multiple indications and two formulations 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of picoplatin on schedule  or at all  include the following  as well as the other risks and uncertainties described in this report we may not have adequate funds to complete the development of picoplatin  picoplatin may not be shown to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials  and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals of the drug or may be unable to obtain such approvals on a timely basis 
if we fail to obtain marketing approvals for picoplatin  are unable to secure adequate commercial supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product  or do not complete development and obtain united states and foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  our operations  financial position and liquidity could be severely impaired  including as follows we would not earn any sales revenue from picoplatin  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our ongoing product development efforts and continued operations  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which could make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms  or at all 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict the period in which material cash inflows from our picoplatin program will commence  if ever 
general and administrative in thousands annual percentage change general and administrative share based compensation total general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million in and increased to approximately million in general and administrative expenses  excluding share based compensation expense  decreased to approximately million in and increased to approximately million in in  the decrease was due primarily to lower personnel and travel costs  partially offset by higher investor relations costs 
the increase in was primarily due to higher personnel costs  resulting from increased headcount  and consulting costs 
share based compensation expense in  and reflects non cash charges recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for share based compensation  under which the fair value of all employee and non employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the share based award 
share based compensation expense decreased to approximately million in and increased to approximately million in in  the decrease was primarily due to the departure of an officer at the end of for whom there was no expense in  the acceleration of vesting of certain stock options held by certain officers in for which there was no similar expense in  and a lower number and value of stock options outstanding in reflecting lower staffing levels  partially offset by expense recognized on restricted stock unit awards 
the increase in was primarily due to a higher number and value of outstanding stock options reflecting higher staffing levels 
restructuring and asset impairments effective march   we implemented a strategic restructuring plan to refocus our cash resources on clinical and commercial development of picoplatin  which resulted in the discontinuation of our preclinical research operations and reduced our workforce by approximately  or eight employees 
this restructuring resulted in charges of million in the first quarter of consisting of million in severance charges and million in other expenses related to the closure of our lab facilities in south san francisco  california 
in conjunction with the decision to discontinue our preclinical research operations  we recognized an asset impairment loss of million on certain facilities and equipment related to the lab in south san francisco  california 
the loss on the assets was determined based on estimates of potential sales values of used equipment 
these impairment charges established new cost bases for the impaired assets  which are included in assets held for sale and reported in prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet for additionally  at december   we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million for our dedicated manufacturing equipment asset 
the impairment charge was determined based on the delay in our plans for the commercialization of picoplatin  which we do not anticipate will occur before other income and expense in thousands annual percentage change interest expense interest income and other  net interest expense increased to approximately million in and increased to approximately million in the increases in interest expense in and were primarily due to increased interest costs resulting from additional borrowings that were effected in september under our bank loan 
interest income and other  net  decreased to million in and decreased to million in the decreases were primarily due to lower average yields from and decreasing balances in our investment securities portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investment securities working capital shareholders equity years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we have historically experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  net of restricted cash of million  totaled million at december  as of december   we had net working capital of million  an accumulated deficit of million and total shareholders equity of million 
we have historically maintained our financial position through strategic management of our resources  including  the sale of equity securities  borrowings under debt instruments  technology licensing and collaborative agreements 
we invest excess cash in investment securities that will be used to fund future operating costs 
cash used for operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
recent developments during  we plan to refocus our resources on regulatory and partnering strategies to support the continued development of picoplatin 
on february   we implemented a restructuring plan to conserve capital resources  which reduced our workforce by approximately  to employees 
we currently estimate that we will incur total restructuring charges of approximately million  consisting mainly of one time employee termination benefits  in connection with the restructuring 
on february   we entered into a sublease agreement with veracyte  inc  pursuant to which veracyte is subleasing  effective march   approximately  square feet of our  square feet of executive office space  or the premises  located at shoreline court  south san francisco  california 
base sublease rental income for this space is  per month 
on september   the subleased space will expand to encompass the entire  square feet of the premises 
after delivery of this expanded sublease space  base sublease rental income will be  per month until expiration of the sublease on july   at which time veracyte will lease the premises directly from the landlord 
additional rent under the sublease will be payable monthly to us by veracyte  based on veracyte s share of operating expenses attributable to the premises 
our sublease with veracyte does not modify or limit the terms and conditions of our original lease with the landlord  or waive any rights or remedies of the landlord  except that the landlord releases us from obligations under the original lease to remove alterations or repair or restore the premises upon expiration of the original lease or following a casualty occurring during the original lease term 
we currently are evaluating our facility space requirements and plan to explore alternative sites in the san francisco area for executive office space 
we expect to save approximately  in future rental and operating expenses as a consequence of the sublease 
on february   we entered into an equity line of credit facility with commerce court  pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement  or the agreement  which provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement  commerce court is committed to purchase up to million of registered shares of our common stock over the approximately month term of the agreement 
from time to time over the term of the agreement  we may  at our sole discretion  present commerce court with draw down notices to purchase our common stock over eight consecutive trading days or such other period mutually agreed upon by us and commerce court 
each draw down is subject to limitations based on the price of the company s common stock and a limit of of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down which limitations may be modified or waived by mutual agreement of the parties 
in no event may we sell commerce court more than  shares of our common stock under the agreement  which is the amount equal to one share less than of our outstanding shares of common stock on the closing date of the agreement  minus the number of share of common stock issued to commerce court in payment of its commitment fee 
in addition  commerce court may not at any time acquire shares under the agreement if  after giving effect to such purchase  commerce court would beneficially own or more of our outstanding common stock 
the agreement does not require commerce court to purchase shares at prices below per share 
once presented with a draw down notice  commerce court is required to purchase a pro rata portion of the shares on each trading day during the trading period on which the daily volume weighted average price for our common stock exceeds a threshold price determined by us for such draw down 
the per share purchase price for these shares will equal the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during the draw down period on which shares are purchased  less a discount ranging from to  based on the trading price of our common stock 
in consideration of commerce court s execution and delivery of the agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock on february  all shares issued pursuant to the agreement are covered by a registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission 
on march   we completed a draw down and sale of  shares of our common stock  at a price of approximately per share  to commerce court under the equity line of credit facility 
net proceeds of approximately  were received  after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately  proceeds of this draw down will be used to fund our efforts to enable a registrational filing to seek regulatory approval of picoplatin as a second line treatment for small cell lung cancer patients with refractory disease and to explore strategic partnering and other relationships to support the continued development of picoplatin in other indications 
capital resources equity financing 
during  we sold an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock to azimuth  pursuant to two draw downs under our equity line of credit facility with azimuth 
in the first draw down on november   we sold approximately million common shares to azimuth at a purchase price of approximately per share 
we sold azimuth approximately million common shares for per share in the second draw down on december  the equity facility terminated by its terms on december  we received aggregate net proceeds from the draw downs of approximately million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the proceeds of the draw downs under the azimuth facility were used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  following our november  announcement that our phase spear trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival 
on april   we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds of the offering were million 
additionally  in april  we received million in net proceeds from an equity financing  pursuant to which we issued million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
investors in the financing also received warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the proceeds of these transactions were used to support our research and clinical development activities and commercialization efforts  as well as for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
secured loan facility 
on september   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with ge business financial services  inc and silicon valley bank  establishing a million senior secured loan facility 
the loan agreement amends and restates our earlier loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital dated as of october   pursuant to which we obtained a million capital loan that was to mature on april  funds under the loan facility were made available as follows i an initial term loan advance in the amount of million  which was comprised of a the outstanding principal balance of million remaining on the original loan and b an additional cash advance of approximately million  which was fully funded on september   and ii a second term loan advance in the amount of million  which was fully funded on september  the advances under the loan facility are repayable over months  commencing on october  interest on the advances is fixed at per annum 
final payments in the amounts of million and million are due upon maturity or earlier repayment of the initial term loan advance and the second term loan advance  respectively 
additionally  as a condition to the amendment and restatement of the original loan  we agreed to modification of the final payment obligations under the original loan  pursuant to which we paid million to silicon valley bank on september   the effective date of the loan facility  and will pay million to ge business financial services on march  the loan facility is secured by a first lien on all of our non intellectual property assets 
in connection with the loan agreement  we issued to the lenders ten year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in october  silicon valley bank exercised its warrants 
in november  we amended the warrants held by ge business financial services to change the exercise price to per share 
at december   the outstanding principal amount under the loan facility was million 
the loan agreement contains restrictions on our ability to  among other things  dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers and acquisition transactions  incur indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments  pay dividends and repurchase stock 
the loan agreement also contains covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum amount of unrestricted cash during the term of the loan equal to the lesser of i million or ii the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the term loans plus million 
the loan agreement contains events of default that include nonpayment of principal  interest or fees  breaches of covenants  material adverse changes  bankruptcy and insolvency events  cross defaults to any other indebtedness  material judgments  inaccuracy of representations and warranties and events constituting a change of control 
the occurrence of an event of default would increase the applicable rate of interest by and could result in the acceleration of our payment obligations under the loan agreement 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants as of december  taking into account the minimum unrestricted cash requirement under the loan agreement and our projected operating results  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalent and investment securities balances  including the net proceeds from our march  sale of common stock to commerce court under our equity line of credit facility  will provide adequate resources to fund operations at least through the end of however  given the uncertainties of outcomes of our regulatory and partnering strategies to support the continued development of picoplatin  there is no assurance that we can achieve our projected operating results 
thereafter  unless we raise additional funds  we will be in default of the loan agreement 
we have no assurance that  especially in light of the current difficult economic environment  the lenders will be willing to waive or renegotiate the terms of the loan agreement to address or avoid financial or other defaults 
if an event of default were to occur  we might not have sufficient funds to repay the loan or to fund our continuing operations 
in such case  we would need to delay  scale back or curtail some or all of our current picoplatin clinical and regulatory efforts  further reduce our workforce  license picoplatin for development and commercialization by third parties  or attempt to sell the company 
provisions of the loan agreement would limit our ability to dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers  incur certain indebtedness  make certain distributions and engage in certain investment activities without the prior consent of the lenders 
we have no assurance that we can obtain financing or otherwise raise additional funds  if at all  on terms acceptable to us or to our lenders 
operating agreements 
we have entered into clinical supply agreements with heraeus and baxter  pursuant to which they produce picoplatin api and finished drug product  respectively  for our clinical trials 
manufacturing services under these clinical supply agreements are provided on a purchase order  fixed fee basis 
our api clinical supply agreement continues in effect until it is terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or by either party in accordance with its terms 
our finished drug product clinical supply agreement had an initial term ending december   and in december  we exercised our first renewal option  extending the term to december  this agreement remains subject to renewal  at our option  for an additional one year term 
the total aggregate cost of clinical supplies of picoplatin api and finished drug product purchased during the year ended december  was million 
we do not have any purchase commitments under these agreements 
we also have entered into a picoplatin api commercial supply agreement with heraeus in march and a finished drug product commercial supply agreement with baxter in november under these agreements  heraeus and baxter will produce picoplatin api and finished drug product  respectively  for commercial use 
manufacturing services are provided on a purchase order  fixed fee basis  subject to certain purchase price adjustments and minimum quantity requirements 
the api commercial supply agreement continues for an initial term ending december   and the finished drug product commercial supply agreement continues for an initial term ending november   in each case subject to extension 
the costs to heraeus for the purchase and set up of dedicated manufacturing equipment costing approximately million will be repaid by us in the form of a surcharge on an agreed upon amount of the picoplatin api ordered and delivered on or before december  if we order and take delivery of less than the agreed upon amount of picoplatin api through december   we will be obligated to pay the balance of the equipment cost as of that date 
heraeus completed construction of the equipment as of december  we determined that the equipment should be accounted for as a capital lease and accordingly recognized an asset and long term obligation for the equipment of million  respectively 
we will reflect the surcharge payments as reductions in the capital lease balance outstanding and will accrete a finance charge to interest expense as specified under the agreement 
due to the delay in our plans for the commercialization of picoplatin  which we do not anticipate will occur before  we determined that our capital lease asset for equipment under the heraeus agreement was impaired as of december  and therefore recognized an impairment charge of million 
we do not have any purchase commitments under these agreements 
during the year ended december   we paid total rent base rent and additional rent based on our share of facility common operating expenses of million under the operating leases for our south san francisco headquarters facility and our seattle facility 
of this amount  million represents total aggregate minimum lease payments under these leases 
as discussed under the heading recent events above  we have entered into a sublease of most  and as of september   all of our headquarter facilities in south san francisco 
potential milestone and royalty obligations 
if we are successful in our efforts to commercialize picoplatin  we would  under our amended license agreement with genzyme  be required to pay genzyme up to million in commercialization milestones upon the attainment of certain levels of annual net sales of picoplatin 
genzyme also would be entitled to royalty payments of up to of annual net sales of picoplatin related products 
we will require substantial additional capital to pursue our regulatory and partnering strategies to support the continued development of picoplatin and to fund our future operations 
management is continuously exploring financing alternatives  including raising additional capital through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities or through the establishment of credit or other funding facilities  and entering into strategic collaborations  which may include joint ventures or partnerships for product development and commercialization  merger  sale of assets or other similar transactions 
the amount of additional financing we will require in the future will depend on a number of factors  including the costs of performing our obligations under our loan facility with ge business financial services and silicon valley bank  including the cost of interest and other payment obligations and penalties and the cost of complying with the covenants and restrictions under the loan agreement  actions taken by the fda and other regulatory authorities  specifically including the results of our ongoing process with the fda to identify a potential regulatory path forward to enable a registrational filing seeking approval of picoplatin for the second line treatment of small cell lung cancer patients with refractory disease and future fda guidance regarding potential regulatory strategies for picoplatin in prostate  colorectal and ovarian cancers  the scope  timing and success of our current and any future picoplatin clinical trials and regulatory and partnering activities to support the continued development of picoplatin in multiple indications and in both intravenous and oral formulations  our access to clinical supplies of picoplatin api and finished drug product in a timely and cost effective manner  the timing and amount of any milestone or other payments we might receive from or be obligated to pay to potential strategic partners  our degree of success in commercializing picoplatin  the emergence of competing technologies and products  and other adverse market developments  the acquisition or in licensing of other products or intellectual property  the costs of any strategic partnerships or other collaborations established  and the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to obtain required additional capital or enter into relationships with potential corporate partners on a timely basis  on terms that ultimately prove favorable to us  or at all 
conditions in the capital markets in general  and in the life science capital market specifically  may affect our potential financing sources and opportunities for strategic partnering 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  assuming that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors
