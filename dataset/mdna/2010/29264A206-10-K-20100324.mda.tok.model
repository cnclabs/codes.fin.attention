overview we design  manufacture and market radio frequency  or rf  products that enable the transmission  reception and processing of high frequency rf signals 

table of contents on april   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with microsemi corporation microsemi pursuant to which microsemi purchased our defense and security rf module business  including all of the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary  endwave defense systems incorporated 
as consideration  microsemi assumed certain liabilities associated exclusively with the defense and security rf module business and paid million in cash 
additionally  as part of the sale  approximately employees associated with the defense and security rf module business transferred to microsemi 
accordingly  we reclassified the results of our defense and security rf module business as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form k  and all amounts set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation reflect such reclassification 
as a result of the divestiture of our defense and security rf module business in april  our products now consist of two key product lines our transceiver modules that serve as the core rf sub system in digital microwave radios are produced for telecommunication network original equipment manufacturers and system integrators located throughout the world  collectively referred to in this report as telecom oems 
telecom oems that purchased our modules accounted for nearly all of our revenues during total revenues from our two largest telecom oem customers  nokia siemens networks and its manufacturing partner  sri radio systems  and nera asa accounted for of our revenues 
our semiconductor product line consists of a wide variety of monolithic microwave integrated circuits  or mmics  including amplifiers  voltage controlled oscillators  up and down converters  variable gain amplifiers  voltage variable attenuators  fixed attenuators and filters 
these devices are used not only in microwave radio transceiver modules  but may also find wide application in other types of telecommunications systems  as well as defense  homeland security  instrumentation and consumer systems 
our semiconductor product line was formally introduced to the market in the latter part of and has not yet become a significant source of revenue for us 
markets and diversification strategy telecommunications market 
most of our rf modules are deployed in telecommunication networks  carrier class trunking networks and point to point transmission networks 
our target customers for these applications are telecom oems 
telecom oems provide the equipment used by service providers to deliver voice  data and video services to businesses and consumers 
non telecommunication markets 
our rf semiconductors are also designed into various applications outside of the telecommunication network market  including defense and homeland security markets 
our target customers in the defense market include defense systems integrators and their subcontractors that design aerospace systems  defense systems and weapons and electronics platforms for both domestic and foreign defense customers 
our target customers in the homeland security market include those utilizing the properties of high frequency rf energy to create new systems designed to detect and identify security threats 
revenues 
due to the divestiture of our defense and security rf module business and associated reclassification of such business as a discontinued operation  telecom oems accounted for nearly all of our total revenues in during  total revenues from continuing operations decreased by million  or  from the demand for our products has declined relative to prior periods as the mobile communication industry has been impacted by the global economic downturn and credit crisis 
additionally  during the second half of a key legacy product for a major customer s radio platform experienced a rapid and unanticipated drop in sales while sales of our new module designs supporting next generation radios were just beginning their production ramp 
the revenues from the new module designs did not offset the decline in revenues from the legacy product 
current market outlook 
the funding of the installation and enhancement of mobile communication networks integrating our products often relies on the availability of credit 
assuming global economic conditions continue to stabilize  we currently estimate revenues in will be higher than revenues in we believe revenue growth  if any  will be due to the ramp of our new module designs supporting next generation radios that 
table of contents began production ramp late in as well as from our semiconductor product line which we announced in september seasonality although we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue at times over the past several years  we do not believe that volatility was primarily attributable to seasonality in our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventories  stock based compensation  income taxes  asset impairments and other commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  below 
revenue recognition our primary customers are telecom oems and other systems integrators that incorporate our products into their systems 
we recognize product revenues at the time title passes  which is generally upon product shipment or when withdrawn from a consignment location  coupled with persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues under development contracts are generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis  using project hours as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing revenues 
alternatively  where a development contract specifies defined progress gates or milestones tied to payments  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis matching the milestones 
revenues attributable to development fees were insignificant during  and the costs incurred under these development agreements are included in research and development expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen 
we also consider our historical level of credit losses 
our allowance was  at december  and  at december  the decrease in our allowance from december  is primarily due to the sale of our defense and security rf module business in april which included the accounts receivable and related allowance for that division 
if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our selling  general and administrative expenses would increase 
warranty reserves we generally offer a to month warranty on all of our products 
we record a liability based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and charge to cost of product revenues the amount of such costs at the time revenues are recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
at 
table of contents december  and our warranty reserves were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in our reserves from december  is primarily due to the sale of our defense and security rf module business in april which included the related warranty reserve for that division 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty reserve and adjust the amounts as necessary 
if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast  or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes review of materials usage  market conditions and product life cycles and an analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand and market conditions 
we adjust inventory balances to approximate the lower of our manufacturing cost or market value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
this would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period 
at the time of write down  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period  related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of product revenues  resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period 
to the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins  we would disclose them 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
all of our stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and shares under our stock purchase plan using the black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of each option grant and the right to purchase shares under our stock purchase plan are estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model and the graded vesting method with assumptions concerning expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life of the award 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
as our stock option awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options  and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
there currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black scholes option valuation model or other allowable valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
deferred taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
we have recorded a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 
long lived assets we periodically review our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges 
significant 
table of contents assumptions and estimates include the projected cash flows based upon estimated revenues and expense growth rates and the discount rate applied to expected cash flows 
in addition  our depreciation policy reflects judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
based on reduced estimates of future revenues and future negative cash flow  we identified potential indicators of impairment 
as a result  we compared the fair value of our long lived assets to their carrying value 
based on our discounted future cash flow and revenue projections  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million for all of our remaining intangible assets with a defined useful life 
these assets relate to the defense and security rf module business and have been included in the income loss for discontinued operations line on the consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  we have no remaining intangible assets with a defined useful life 
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life we are required to assess the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life annually or whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred 
during the fourth quarter of  based on the fair value of our common stock relative to our book value  revised estimates for our future revenues and the continued worsening of the global economy  we determined that indicators of potential impairment were present 
based on the fair market value of the business and our discounted future cash flow and revenue projections  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million for goodwill and million for intangible assets with an indefinite life 
these assets relate to the defense and security rf module business and have been included in the income loss for discontinued operations line on the consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  we have no remaining intangible assets with a defined useful life 
fair value measurement our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets level and less active markets level 
level instrument valuations are obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets 
level instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments 
as of december   we did not have any assets or liabilities without observable market values that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value level 
business combinations for our business combinations  the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between the intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the valuation of intangible assets is based on an income approach methodology that values the intangible assets based on the future cash flows that could potentially be generated by the asset over its estimated remaining life discounted to its present value utilizing an appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
as a result of business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results

during  the cost of product revenues as a percentage of revenues increased compared to  primarily due to the decreased absorption of our overhead costs resulting from decreased production  continued pricing pressure resulting in lower product margins  an  increase in inventory reserves due to excess material related to a rapid and unanticipated drop in sales of a legacy product for a major customer s radio platform and an  increase in reserve for material related to a product built for a customer currently in bankruptcy liquidation 
the cost of product revenues in both periods was favorably impacted by the utilization of inventory that was previously written off  amounting to approximately  during and  during we continue to focus on reducing the cost of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues through the introduction of new designs and technology and further improvements to our offshore manufacturing processes

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb fasb issued new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of  however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued new standards for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
these new standards amend the scope of pre existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products 
these new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of  however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued amended standards that require additional fair value disclosures 
these amended standards require disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant transfers  beginning in the first quarter of we do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk based on changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
in order to reduce this interest rate risk  we invest our cash primarily in investments with short maturities 
as of december   our investments in our portfolio were classified as cash equivalents and short term investments 
the cash equivalents and short term investments consisted primarily of united states treasury notes  united states government agency notes  united states government money market funds  prime money market fund  corporate notes and commercial paper 
since our investments consist of cash equivalents and short term investments  a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce interest income 
currently  all sales to international customers are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency rate risks in connection with these sales 
however  if the dollar were to strengthen relative to other currencies that could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and thereby lead to a decrease in revenues attributable to international customers 
we currently pay a number of expenses related to our thai personnel and office in thai bhat 
during  the total payments made in thai bhat were  and we recorded a related foreign currency transaction loss of
